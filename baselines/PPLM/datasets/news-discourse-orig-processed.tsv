Main	Mortgage Investors Corp., the beleaguered home lender run by prominent civic activist Bill Edwards, is laying off about 325 employees at its St. Petersburg headquarters, roughly a third of its workforce.
Distant_Evaluation	''We had to pull in our wings, (but) my plans are to stay in business,'' Edwards said in an interview Wednesday.
Cause_Specific	The company has been hammered with complaints for misleading customers and calling millions of people on the federal Do Not Call list.
Distant_Evaluation	But Edwards, 68, flatly rejected allegations of unsatisfied customers, blaming his woes solely on an industry-wide drop in mortgage refinancings amid higher interest rates.
Distant_Evaluation	It’s the same issue, he said, that has triggered layoffs for top lenders including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
Distant_Evaluation	''My problem is there is no liquidity in the bond markets and without bonds, we can’t provide mortgages,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''You just can’t create mortgage-backed securities.
Distant_Evaluation	.?.?.
Distant_Evaluation	I haven’t seen this in 20 years where there are all sellers and no buyers of bonds, but it is what it is.''
Main	A layoff notice filed with the state Wednesday indicated that about 380 workers at Mortgage Investors headquarters at 6090 Central Ave. would lose their jobs this week.
Main	Edwards said he over-calculated in the filing and the layoff count will be closer to 325, leaving the company with about 600 employees.
Cause_General	Most of the affected employees worked in the call center or as loan processors.
Cause_General	They will continue to receive full pay and benefits for 60 days.
Cause_Specific	The news comes less than a month after the Federal Trade Commission levied a civil penalty of $7.5 million on the home lender, the largest fine ever for a violation of the Do Not Call rule.
Cause_Specific	Mortgage Investors called more than 5.4 million phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry to pitch home loan refinancing services to current and former members of the U.S. military, according to the FTC.
Cause_Specific	In initial findings, the FTC said telemarketers led service members to believe they could receive low-interest, fixed-rate mortgages at no cost, ''often quoting rates that they implied would last the duration of their loan.''
Cause_Specific	In reality, regulators said, the company offered only adjustable rate mortgages that left customers liable for higher payments with rising interest rates.
Cause_Specific	It also required customers to pay closing costs.
Distant_Evaluation	On Wednesday, Edwards said the company cooperated with the FTC, but he called the charges unfounded, alleging that the FTC ''wanted to use me as a poster child’' to mark the 10th anniversary of the Do Not Call registry.
Distant_Evaluation	Mortgage Investors disputed in particular any allegations that it has deceived veterans about mortgage terms, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	He also insisted that scores of online complaints about Mortgage Investors are not from ''real’' customers, dismissing them as anonymous online postings.
Distant_Evaluation	''As far as misleading someone on a loan, I’ve never had one complaint,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''I don’t have any real complaints from real customers sitting in my files.''
Cause_General	The Times has talked to several homeowners who complained about deceptive and pressurizing tactics by Mortgage Investors.
Distant_Anecdotal	Among them: Don LaBarge, 73, of Brooksville, who said he agreed to refinance at a 2.5 percent rate with Mortgage Investors after being told the rate would be fixed for years.
Distant_Anecdotal	''Eight months after we were making payments, I got a bill from them,'' he said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''Our house payment was going up $39.
Distant_Anecdotal	One full percent.''
Cause_General	Edwards remained adamant that no complaints made their way to him.
Distant_Evaluation	''I can honestly say to you I’ve had no complaints from anyone who has gotten a loan from Mortgage Investors in almost 20 years.
Distant_Evaluation	That’s all I can tell you,'' he reiterated.
Distant_Evaluation	Asked about specific local cases such as LaBarge’s, he said: ''I haven’t heard from those people, but send them my way.
Distant_Evaluation	I’d certainly be happy to chat with them.''
Cause_General	Founded in 1938, Mortgage Investors has grown into one of the country’s biggest refinancers of veterans’ home loans.
Cause_General	Beyond running the mortgage firm, Edwards also runs a music production company.
Cause_General	He also runs the city-owned Mahaffey Theater and bought downtown St. Petersburg’s BayWalk complex with plans to revitalize it as the renamed Shops at St. Pete.
Distant_Historical	Earlier this year, Edwards said he planned to retire and arranged a sale of the mortgage firm to Tampa-based HomeBancorp.
Distant_Historical	But the deal fell apart.
Cause_General	Today he’s focusing on staying in business.
Distant_Evaluation	''I had run this company for 20 years, and I took a couple of years off to do something fun,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''So I’m back doing it now and paying attention to what’s going on.''

Main	TUNIS, Tunisia - Tunisia, birthplace of the Arab Spring revolutionary movement, was plunged into a new political crisis Thursday when assassins shot an opposition party leader outside his home in a hail of gunfire.
Main_Consequence	It was the second political assassination in Tunisia since February, and quickly incited protests blaming Ennahda, the moderate Islamist party that leads the government.
Main_Consequence	Crowds of protesters gathered outside the offices of the Interior Ministry in Tunis, the capital, calling on Ennahda to relinquish power, and security forces were deployed to contain them.
Main_Consequence	The Associated Press reported that protests erupted in other cities, including Sidi Bouzid, the impoverished town where the Tunisian revolution began, and in the nearby town of Meknassi, where angry demonstrators burned down the local Ennahda headquarters.
Distant_Evaluation	Ennahda issued a statement calling the assassination “cowardly and despicable.” The leader of Ennahda, Rachid al-Ghannouchi, said on Tunisian radio: “This is a crime against the democratic transition of Tunisia.
Distant_Evaluation	The classic question is: Who is behind this?
Distant_Evaluation	I don’t think that any political party would want this.”
Main	TAP, Tunisia’s official news agency, said the victim was Mohamed Brahmi.
Main	Brahmi, 58, leader of the Arab nationalist People’s Party, was felled by several bullets outside his residence in Ariana, a suburb of Tunis.
Main	Other local Tunisian media said a pair of gunmen had shot Brahmi at least 11 times as he sat in a car with his daughter and that the killers escaped on a moped.
Main_Consequence	At a hospital where Brahmi’s body was taken, dozens of protesters gathered to denounce Ennahda.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Ghannouchi is an assassin!” said a woman draped in a Tunisian flag.
Distant_Anecdotal	Others shouted: “The Islamists are vampires!”
Distant_Anecdotal	Noomen Toumi, one of the protesters at the hospital, said he believed Islamist extremists might have been behind the assassination of Brahmi.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It has to be someone who is against democracy,” he said.
Cause_General	The assassination, which coincided with celebrations for the 56th anniversary of Tunisian statehood after independence from France, came as Tunisia was still grappling with a democratic transition following the January 2011 revolution that toppled the country’s autocratic leader, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, and forced him into exile.
Distant_Historical	The Tunisian revolution was the catalyst that spawned similar uprisings in Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Syria.
Distant_Evaluation	The top human rights official at the United Nations, Navi Pillay, expressed shock at the killing of Brahmi and urged “the authorities to immediately launch a prompt and transparent investigation to ensure that the people who carried out this crime are held accountable.”
Error	EDNOTES: (FOR USE BY NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE CLIENTS)
Main	A company alleged to have used deceptive practices to sell supplemental health insurance to veterans and other Massachusetts residents will pay more than $5 million to settle, Attorney General Martha Coakley said Tuesday.
Cause_General	The settlement, now totaling $5.25 million, represents an increase of $1.5 million over an earlier agreement reached between Coakley’s office and Life Insurance Company of North America, in July 2012.
Cause_Specific	The increase in restitution to consumers and penalties is a result of the insurer’s failure to meet the conditions of the original settlement, Coakley said.
Distant_Evaluation	''LINA’s failures to comply fully with its obligations under the consent judgment are unacceptable,'' Coakley said in a statement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''This amendment will ensure that all Massachusetts consumers entitled to relief under the settlement will receive restitution from this company and will help further our ongoing efforts to ensure access to mental health services to veterans and their families.''
Distant_Evaluation	In a statement, the insurance company said it believes it complied with the provisions of the initial settlement and will continue to return premiums, as it has been doing, to affected Massachusetts residents.
Distant_Evaluation	The amended accord, the company said, clarifies both parties’ understanding of the agreement.
Distant_Evaluation	''While the company agreed to pay a fine to avoid costly and time-consuming litigation,'' the statement added, ''the settlement recognizes LINA’s good-faith belief that it did not represent or market these products as 'health care insurance.'
Distant_Evaluation	''
Cause_Specific	Coakley’s initial complaint charged that the company used deceptive methods to market health insurance to veterans, especially those from World War II.
Cause_Specific	It used direct mail and Internet solicitations to make the insurance appear to be a government program, exaggerating benefits, misrepresenting coverage limits, and making false claims about its rates, according to the attorney general’s office.
Cause_Specific	It also denied coverage based on preexisting conditions, which is illegal in Massachusetts, according to the complaint.
Cause_Specific	More than 1,000 Massachusetts consumers bought the policies, according to Coakley’s office.
Cause_Specific	The initial settlement required the company to identify all consumers who had purchased supplemental insurance and refund premiums, minus any insurance claims paid by the insurer.
Cause_Specific	But many customers have not received their payments, Coakley said.
Cause_Specific	Coakley’s office went back to court to ensure the company would meet its obligations.
Cause_General	In an amended settlement, the company agreed to pay an additional $750,000 in restitution to consumers, bringing the total to $3.5 million.
Cause_General	It also agreed to pay an additional $375,000 in penalties and $375,000 to fund mental health services for veterans, on top of the $1 million in the original settlement.
Main_Consequence	That brings the total the insurer has agreed to pay the state as a deterrent to $1.75 million, Coakley’s office said.
Main_Consequence	Last month, with funds from the original settlement, the attorney general’s office awarded $500,000 in grants to five organizations to provide mental health services to veterans.

Main	LOS ANGELES - A year after Daniel Chong, a San Diego college student, was found hallucinating and suffering from kidney failure inside a Drug Enforcement Administration holding cell where he had been accidentally left for four days, the agency has agreed to compensate him for his ordeal.
Main	The federal government has agreed to pay Chong $4.1 million, Julia Yoo, one of his lawyers, said this week.
Distant_Historical	Chong’s lawyers filed a legal claim seeking $20 million last year.
Distant_Evaluation	“It was an accident,” Chong, now 25, said at a news conference Tuesday to announce the settlement, “a really, really bad, terrible accident.”
Distant_Evaluation	Chong was picked up last year during a raid on his friend’s house, where he and some friends had gathered to smoke marijuana.
Distant_Historical	Chong, a student at the University of California, San Diego, and the other suspects were taken to DEA offices, where he was interviewed.
Distant_Historical	Agents told Chong that he would be released, he said, and he was taken to a holding cell to wait for what he was told would be a few minutes.
Distant_Historical	Instead, he was forgotten inside the cell for four days.
Distant_Historical	Without food or water, he drank his own urine, contemplated taking his own life and tried to scratch a goodbye note to his mother into his arm.
Distant_Evaluation	When agents found him on the fifth day, he thought he might be minutes from death.
Distant_Historical	He spent several days in a hospital intensive care unit, where he was treated for severe dehydration and kidney failure.
Distant_Evaluation	Over the past year, his lawyers said, he has continued to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder.
Distant_Evaluation	“His doctor said this was one of the worst cases of stress he had ever seen,” Eugene G. Iredale, one of Chong’s lawyers, said in an interview Wednesday.
Distant_Historical	The DEA issued an apology shortly after Chong was found in the cell.
Cause_General	A spokeswoman for the agency Wednesday refused to comment on the settlement but confirmed that the detention policies had been changed.
Cause_General	The Office of the Inspector General in the Justice Department was reviewing the case.

Main	Three former high-ranking Penn State officials, including the university’s former president, Graham B. Spanier, were ordered Tuesday to stand trial on charges that they were part of a cover-up related to the child sexual abuse scandal involving former football coach Jerry Sandusky.
Cause_Specific	After a two-day preliminary hearing this week, Harrisburg District Judge William Werner decided there was enough evidence against Spanier, retired university vice president Gary Schultz and former athletic director Tim Curley to proceed with a trial, which could start later this year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That would be the next public chapter of the scandal, which threw the university and its most prominent athletic program into turmoil.
Cause_General	Two weeks ago, Penn State’s board of trustees authorized the payment of about $60 million to settle claims made by dozens of Sandusky’s victims.
Cause_Specific	The numerous charges against the men include perjury, conspiracy and endangering the welfare of children.
Cause_Specific	During the preliminary hearing, prosecutors accused the men of knowing of abuse allegations against Sandusky but failing to properly report them.
Cause_Specific	They are also accused of hiding information from investigators and lying to a grand jury.
Distant_Historical	The allegations stem from an incident in 2001, in which former Penn State assistant coach Mike McQueary said he saw Sandusky molesting a boy in a university shower.
Cause_Specific	At Sandusky’s trial, McQueary testified that he reported the incident to Joe Paterno - Penn State’s famed former coach - Curley and Schultz.
Distant_Evaluation	Curley and Schultz have said McQueary did not make it clear the act was sexual in nature.
Distant_Evaluation	Spanier denied knowing the full nature of the incident.
Distant_Evaluation	But emails between the three men revealed that Spanier, Curley and Schultz had decided in 2001 to confront Sandusky themselves, instead of reporting the allegations.
Distant_Historical	“The only downside for us is if the message isn’t 'heard’ and acted upon, and we then become vulnerable for not having reported it,” Spanier wrote at the time.
Distant_Historical	The emails also included discussion of abuse allegations against Sandusky from 1998.
Cause_Specific	Spanier had testified to a grand jury that he had not been aware of the 1998 allegations.
Cause_Specific	McQueary testified this week that Paterno had told him that the university botched its response to the Sandusky scandal and warned him that he would be made the scapegoat.
Distant_Historical	McQueary said Paterno told him, “Old Main screwed up,” referencing the landmark campus building that houses the offices of the president and other administrators.

Main	Pages from the diary of a chief Hitler aide, Alfred Rosenberg, missing since the conclusion of the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders nearly 70 years ago, were briefly displayed Thursday for the first time by the federal investigators who helped recover them.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The diary, handwritten on loose-leaf pages with entries dating from 1936 through 1944, is likely to offer new insights into the decision to exterminate the Jews, infighting among top Nazi officials and the plunder of Europe’s art, said scholars at the U.S.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.
Distant_Evaluation	It offers a window “into the mind of a dark soul,” said John T. Morton, director of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which investigates lost and stolen cultural property.
Cause_General	Although parts of Rosenberg’s diary are in the National Archives, and excerpts have been published in German, most of this first-person account remains unknown.
Distant_Evaluation	The tangled journey of the diary could itself be the subject of a television mini-series.
Distant_Historical	According to the Holocaust museum, after the trials ended, and Rosenberg was hanged in 1946, Robert M.W.
Distant_Historical	Kempner, a Nuremberg prosecutor, received permission from the office of the chief of counsel of war crimes to keep documents “for purposes of writing, lecturing and study.” With that brief approval in hand, Kempner took the diary, along with thousands of other documents, back to his home in Landsdowne, Pa.
Distant_Historical	After Kempner died in 1993, the Holocaust museum negotiated a deal with his sons to collect his papers, said Henry Mayer, the museum’s senior adviser on archives.
Distant_Historical	Legal wrangling over the estate delayed the transfer, and when the museum finally picked up the documents in 1999, the diary and other materials were not among them.
Distant_Historical	Federal agents tracked a batch of missing papers to Herbert Richardson, an academic publisher and former professor in Lewiston, N.Y., and a friend of one of Kempner’s longtime secretaries.
Distant_Historical	He turned over some documents, but the diary was not among them, Mayer explained.
Distant_Historical	The museum kept up the search, and it led again to Richardson.
Cause_Specific	He turned the pages over to federal agents in April, and the museum authenticated them.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Morton declined to comment on the investigation, but he said that when the government’s civil forfeiture process was completed, the diary would be turned over to the museum.
Distant_Evaluation	There are “fewer and fewer living victims and witnesses to the horror of the Third Reich,” he said, which makes the original documents of that era all the more important.

Main	DETROIT - A federal bankruptcy judge on Wednesday cleared the way for Detroit’s bankruptcy case to go forward without legal challenges.
Main	The decision by Judge Steven Rhodes of U.S. Bankruptcy Court freezes all litigation against the city during the bankruptcy process and consolidates state-level legal challenges to Detroit’s Chapter 9 filing into the federal bankruptcy case.
Distant_Evaluation	The federal bankruptcy court has “exclusive jurisdiction” over the case, he said, adding, “There is no case law that holds otherwise.”
Distant_Evaluation	It was a dramatic beginning to the largest municipal bankruptcy case in American history.
Distant_Evaluation	The judge was attempting to put to rest a legal spat that began almost immediately after Detroit filed for bankruptcy last Thursday, the largest American city ever to do so.
Cause_Specific	On Friday a state judge, Judge Rosemarie Aquilina of Ingham County Circuit Court, ruled that the filing violated the state constitution, which protects the pensions of retired public employees.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The city has been expected to seek reductions in pensions in bankruptcy court as part of its broader efforts to reduce Detroit’s estimated $18 billion in debts and other obligations.
Cause_Specific	Aquilina’s ruling was appealed by the state attorney general to the Michigan Court of Appeals, which on Tuesday issued a stay of her order pending their appellate decision.
Main	But on Wednesday, in the first hearing on the Chapter 9 case, Rhodes approved a motion by the city’s emergency financial manager, Kevyn D. Orr, to freeze all litigation against the city during the bankruptcy process.
Main_Consequence	The move effectively gives Rhodes the authority to rule on the issues raised by retired public employees regarding their pensions.
Main_Consequence	Rhodes also granted a second motion by the emergency manager that extends protection from litigation to Gov.
Main_Consequence	Rick Snyder of Michigan and other state officials.
Cause_Specific	Last week, Snyder accepted the city’s emergency manager’s recommendation and ordered Detroit to file for Chapter 9.
Distant_Evaluation	Both Snyder and Orr have said that a bankruptcy filing was the only option to settle Detroit’s crushing debt.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	ROME - When Cécile Kyenge accepted the post of minister of integration in Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s center-left government, she knew that as Italy’s first black national official she would be breaking new ground.
Distant_Evaluation	What she may not have expected was the stream of racial slurs that have accompanied her first eight weeks in office.
Cause_General	Death threats have been posted on Facebook, and in one case this month, a City Council member in Padua called for Kyenge to be raped so that she could “understand” what victims felt.
Cause_General	The councilor, Dolores Valandro, who made the comment in a discussion about a woman said to have been raped by an African man, was subsequently expelled from her party, the anti-immigrant Northern League.
Cause_General	The verbal attacks have been worrying enough that Kyenge, 48, who was born in the Democratic Republic of Congo and moved to Italy at 19, now travels with heightened security.
Distant_Evaluation	She has so far chosen not to respond directly to her detractors but instead has praised the many who have spoken out in her support to underscore the need for Italians to strive for civility.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s up to the institutions, to the population, to give a response to these attacks,” Kyenge said in a recent interview in her stately office in central Rome.
Distant_Evaluation	If discussion alone were the goal, then Kyenge’s appointment would have already succeeded.
Main	It has opened a national debate on the tension between the increasingly multicultural nature of Italian society and the undercurrent of racism that is increasingly difficult for Italians to ignore.
Distant_Evaluation	Experts who track immigration issues say that more subtle and insidious forms of racism are pervasive in Italy as it struggles to come to terms with its rapidly changing demographics.
Distant_Historical	In 2011, immigrants made up 7.5 percent of Italy’s population, more than double the percentage of just a decade before.
Distant_Evaluation	That influx has combined with Italy’s long economic crisis in ways that have frequently confused or obfuscated the causes of the malaise, with immigrants serving as easy scapegoats.
Distant_Evaluation	“Kyenge - the first black person, the first immigrant - became minister in a very difficult, tense moment,” said Ferruccio Pastore, director of the International and European Forum for Migration Research in Turin.
Distant_Evaluation	“It will be a test of the maturity of the political system, of the civil maturity of Italians.
Distant_Evaluation	It’s an important test.”
Main	Gyula Horn, a former leader of Hungary who in 1989 ripped a hole in the Iron Curtain, helping to set off months of tumultuous change in which communist governments in Eastern Europe fell one after the other, died Wednesday in Budapest.
Cause_General	He was 80.
Cause_General	The Hungarian government announced the death.
Cause_Specific	He had been hospitalized since 2007 with what was reported to be a brain malfunction.
Distant_Evaluation	Horn’s life encompassed much of the history of 20th-century Hungary.
Distant_Historical	His father, a communist, was executed by the Nazis occupying Hungary in 1944.
Distant_Historical	Gyula (pronounced JOO-la) also became a hard-line communist, serving in militia units that hunted down government opponents during their revolt in 1956.
Distant_Historical	The rebels lynched his brother, also a communist.
Distant_Evaluation	As foreign minister, as Moscow’s grip on Eastern Europe slipped, Horn proved nimble as a newly minted, nonideological, pragmatic reformer in helping to lead Hungary away from communism.
Distant_Historical	Elected prime minister as a socialist in 1994, he angered Hungarians by cutting social programs to stanch raging inflation.
Distant_Historical	Horn’s indelible image was a photograph taken of him and Alois Mock, the Austrian foreign minister, on June 27, 1989, cutting through once-electrified barbed wire on the border between their two countries.
Distant_Evaluation	The men seemed to be tearing the Iron Curtain, the daunting symbol of the ideological rivalry and actual physical boundary between communist and non-communist Europe.
Distant_Historical	The truth was that the removal of the fence had begun two months earlier, because it was badly in need of repair.
Distant_Evaluation	But the critical meaning of the stunt - which dozens of photographers were invited to document - was that it provoked no reaction in the Soviet Union, although it had tens of thousands of troops stationed in Hungary.
Distant_Evaluation	Horn said his purpose was to create “an irreversible situation.”
Distant_Evaluation	Events accelerated.
Distant_Historical	East Germans, who had long gone to Hungary to meet with West German friends and relatives, refused to return home.
Distant_Historical	The border police turned a blind eye when several hundred slipped across to Austria during a picnic Aug. 19.
Distant_Historical	Three weeks after the picnic, Horn appeared on Hungarian television and announced that the East Germans were free to cross the border.
Distant_Historical	Two months later, the Berlin Wall was breached and communist dictatorships began to fall.
Distant_Historical	In 1990, Horn was awarded the Charlemagne Prize - whose winners include Winston Churchill and Vaclav Havel, the former Czech president - for laying “one of the foundation stones for European unity.” The prize is given by the city of Aachen, Germany.
Distant_Historical	Gyula Horn was born July 5, 1932, in Budapest, the capital.
Distant_Historical	The third of eight children, he was raised in a working-class district of the city.
Distant_Historical	After the Gestapo killed his father, he went to work at 11 in manual labor jobs.
Distant_Historical	In 1950 he was sent to Russia to study accounting at an economics institute in Rostov on Don.
Distant_Historical	He returned to work in Hungary’s Finance Ministry.
Distant_Historical	He joined the Foreign Ministry in 1959 and served as a diplomat in Bulgaria and Romania before working his way up to deputy foreign minister in 1985 and foreign minister in 1989.
Distant_Historical	After Hungarians rebelled against the communist government in 1956, he joined a brigade that helped hunt down and arrest democratic activists.
Distant_Evaluation	He never denied taking these actions, but said he had never hurt anybody.
Distant_Historical	Nonetheless, two Hungarian presidents vetoed his nomination for high national awards in 2002 and 2007 because of his actions during and after the uprising.
Distant_Historical	In the 1970s, Horn worked cautiously to liberalize government controls in Hungary in an experiment that came to be known as “goulash communism.” As even that system collapsed, he was instrumental in transforming the Communist Party into the Hungarian Socialist Party.
Distant_Historical	He became the party’s chairman in 1990.
Distant_Historical	He was elected to Parliament the same year and retained his seat until 2010.
Distant_Historical	In the 1994 election, he led the Socialists to a majority.
Distant_Historical	But in forming a government he included liberals as a way to reassure Hungarians and foreigners who were concerned that the former Communist Party might regain power.
Distant_Historical	He stepped down after his party lost in 1998.
Cause_General	Horn is survived by his wife, Anna Kiraly; a daughter, Anna; and a son, Gyula Jr.
Main	Bausch & Lomb, the eye care company, agreed Monday to sell itself to Valeant Pharmaceuticals International of Canada for about $8.7 billion, sidestepping the lengthier process of an initial public offering.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Under the terms of the deal, Valeant will pay $4.5 billion to the investor group that owns Bausch & Lomb, led by the private equity firm Warburg Pincus.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It will also spend about $4.2 billion to repay Bausch & Lomb’s debt.
Distant_Evaluation	The deal continues the flurry of deal-making in the health care industry, as companies seek to buy the growth they are hard-pressed to generate on their own.
Cause_General	Announced merger volume in the sector this year is up 14 percent from the period a year earlier, even as takeovers have fallen 8 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	Valeant, which is based in Laval, Quebec, has made acquisitions a core part of its growth strategy.
Cause_General	The Bausch & Lomb deal is the company’s biggest yet, over three times larger than the $2.6 billion purchase of the skin care company Medicis Pharmaceutical last year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Adding Bausch & Lomb, a giant maker of contact lens solution and surgical devices, will significantly bolster Valeant’s offerings in the sector.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Bausch & Lomb will absorb its new parent’s existing ophthalmology operations, creating a business that is expected to generate over $3.5 billion in net revenue this year.
Distant_Evaluation	“We believe it’s a great move for the company,” J. Michael Pearson, Valeant’s chief executive, said in an interview by phone.
Distant_Evaluation	“There’s an opportunity for a lot of singles and doubles here.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The takeover also means a tidy payday for Warburg Pincus, which led a $4.5 billion leveraged buyout of Bausch & Lomb in 2007.
Cause_General	The firm already benefited from a $772 million special dividend Bausch & Lomb paid out in March, the bulk of which went to its controlling investor group.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Through the deal, Warburg Pincus is expected to reap a return of as much as three times its original investment, according to a person briefed on the matter.
Distant_Historical	Warburg Pincus had begun exploring a sale or initial public offering for Bausch & Lomb late last year, and held preliminary talks with a number of potential bidders.
Distant_Evaluation	Among them was Valeant, though Pearson said that at the time he and his board could not justify paying the more than $10 billion Warburg Pincus was seeking.
Cause_General	Instead, Bausch & Lomb filed for an initial public offering in March.
Cause_General	Until last month, Valeant was pursuing a takeover of a different company, the generic drugmaker Actavis, in what would have been a deal worth over $13 billion.
Cause_Specific	When those talks collapsed, Valeant then pivoted to Bausch & Lomb.
Cause_General	Pearson said the bulk of the work on Monday’s transaction took place over last week, with much of the initial due diligence having been completed already.
Cause_General	Though Valeant’s offer was lower than the valuation Bausch & Lomb would have fetched in an initial offering, it allowed Warburg Pincus to exit its investment quickly.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Taking the eye care company public would have meant a more gradual sale over two to three years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter, pending regulatory approval.
Distant_Evaluation	Pearson said that while integrating Bausch & Lomb would take some time, Valeant will continue to pursue what he described as smaller “tuck in” acquisitions.
Distant_Evaluation	But deal-making will remain a core part of the company’s growth plans.
Distant_Evaluation	“Our strategy is our strategy,” he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Our aspiration is to become the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world.”
Main	MEXICO CITY - Guatemalan officials rousted an imprisoned former president Friday and put him on a plane to the U.S. to face long-pending corruption charges.
Cause_General	The extradition of the former president, Alfonso Portillo, who had fought being sent to the U.S. for two years, caught much of Guatemala by surprise and came amid complaints about the country’s willingness to attack impunity among elites.
Cause_General	The extradition followed a high court decision this week to annul a genocide verdict against a former dictator, Gen. Efraín Ríos Montt, who had been convicted of trying to annihilate an indigenous group during Guatemala’s nearly four-decade civil war, which ended in 1996.
Cause_General	On Monday the court found procedural problems in the trial and ruled that part of it must be repeated.
Cause_Specific	Portillo, who was president from 2000 to 2004, faces charges in U.S. court in New York of conspiring to launder about $70 million of his country’s funds through U.S. banks.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As police officers put him on a plane, swarmed by reporters, Portillo said he was being “kidnapped” and predicted that he would be back when the case fell apart.
Distant_Historical	After leaving office, he worked in Mexico as a financial adviser until he was extradited to Guatemala in 2008 to face embezzlement charges.
Distant_Historical	In 2010, the U.S. filed its own charges against him for what a prosecutor called “converting the office of the Guatemalan presidency into his personal ATM.”
Distant_Historical	The following year, he was acquitted in the Guatemala case, but the U.S. continued to push for his prosecution.
Cause_General	He has been held in prison and in a military hospital, where he was treated for liver and heart ailments.
Cause_General	He was flown to the U.S. in an air ambulance.
Cause_General	On Friday morning the interior minister authorized his transfer, a decision that the U.S. Embassy called “an important affirmation of the rule of law and due process.”
Distant_Evaluation	The timing stirred skepticism among analysts, coming as international criticism of the justice system had grown after the erratic course of the Ríos Montt case.
Cause_General	Protesters took to the streets of Guatemala City on Friday to denounce the court’s decision to nullify the verdict.
Distant_Evaluation	Anita J. Isaacs, a professor at Haverford College who studies Guatemala, said the decision to extradite Portillo had to be seen as an attempt to divert attention from the overturning of the Ríos Montt verdict.

Main	The state’s highest court has ruled that judges have the authorÂity to stay the sentences of so-called Dookhan defendants who are seeking new trials, upholding the legal framework created to review hundreds of cases tied to the state drug lab scandal.
Main	In a decision issued Monday, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the ''exceptional circumstances’' surrounding convictions tied to Annie Dookhan, the former state chemist who allegedly falsified suspected drug samples, gave Superior Court judges the power to free defendants who are challenging their convictions.
Main	''The allegations of misÂconduct at the Hinton drug lab have given rise to serious concerns about defendants who may be incarcerated as a consequence of tainted convictions,'' the ruling stated.
Main	''Thus, a defendant’s motion to stay the execution of his sentence should be decided in an expeditious manner.''
Distant_Evaluation	While largely procedural, the decision highlighted the swirl of legal questions surrounding Dookhan-related cases, which have flooded the judicial system and led to the release of hundreds of defendants, more than 300 from state prisons and more from county facilities.
Distant_Historical	Last fall, Essex County prosecutors contested motions to stay sentences in more than 50 cases involving allegedly tainted drug evidence, contending that the judge lacked the authority to stay sentences in the absence of a pending appeal.
Main	The court disagreed, saying ''the interest of justice is not served by the continued imprisonment of a defendant who may be entitled to a new trial.''
Main	''The magnitude of the allegations of serious and far-reaching misconduct by Dookhan at the Hinton drug lab cannot be overstated,'' the ruling stated.
Main	''The alleged misconduct may have compromised thousands of Âcases.''
Cause_Specific	Dookhan faces a host of criminal charges related to misÂhandling or falsifying drug evidence.
Cause_Specific	She has pleaded not guilty.
Distant_Evaluation	Matthew Segal, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said the decision marked a ''complete Ârejection’' of prosecutors’ attempt to challenge the system set up to handle the Dookhan cases.
Distant_Evaluation	''It said the exact procedure being used is fine,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	The court went a step further, Segal said, in indicating that Dookhan’s involvement in cases may be enough to warrant a new trial.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''My hope is that courts will look at this opinion and see reasons for granting new trials,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''You can’t rest a conviction on fraud.''
Distant_Evaluation	Jonathan W. Blodgett, the ÂEssex district attorney, said the decision clarified legal and procedural questions around the special drug lab sessions, reducing the chances of further litigation.
Distant_Evaluation	''Our overriding concern was the possibility of relitigating Dookhan drug lab cases for a third time,'' he said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	''This would have stretched the already limited Âresources of all the district attorney’s offices.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Michael O’Keefe, district Âattorney for the Cape and ÂIslands, said the decision would help prosecutors handle the host of legal challenges arising from the scandal, which officials have estimated could affect well over 100,000 cases.
Distant_Evaluation	''As district attorneys, our goal is to expedite the cases as quickly as possible,'' said O’Keefe, president of the state association of district attorneys.
Distant_Evaluation	''In that Âregard, it’s helpful to know what the rules are.''
Cause_General	In a separate section of the ruling, the court said that special magistrates who were appointed by the Superior Court to preside over the drug lab sessions are not authorized to stay a sentence.
Cause_General	But the magistrates, who by March had conducted more than 900 hearings on Dookhan-related cases, can make ''conclusions of law’' for judges to review, as they have been doing.
Cause_General	The court also ruled that magistrates cannot overrule a Superior Court judge’s decision to stay a sentence.
Distant_Evaluation	Anne Goldbach, forensic services director in the state public defender’s office, said the decision upholds the status quo.
Distant_Evaluation	''It says that the process set up to handle these cases is a valid one,'' she said.
Cause_General	The court’s decision focused on a case involving a Lynn man, Shubar Charles, who in 2010 pleaded guilty to cocaine possession with intent to distribute.
Distant_Historical	He was sentenced to four to seven years in state prison.
Distant_Historical	Last December, he filed a Âmotion to stay the execution of his sentence, noting that Dookhan was the primary chemist on the case.
Distant_Historical	The motion was granted, and prosecutors Âappealed.
Cause_General	A second case involved ÂHector Milette, who in 2011 pleaded guilty to cocaine trafficking.
Distant_Historical	In November, a judge Âdenied his motion for a stayed sentence, but a special magistrate overturned the decision in February.
Distant_Historical	Prosecutors appealed, and he was sent back into custody.
Distant_Historical	He later pleaded guilty, admitting the substance was cocaine despite Dookhan’s involvement, prosecutors said.
Distant_Evaluation	ST. PETERSBURG — Stacia Kay Berman was the teenage girl who never minded playing Parcheesi and Monopoly with a brother and sister who were a decade younger.
Distant_Evaluation	She was a lover of words and books, a poet who penned thoughtful lines about being in a room with a view of a sea that looks like forever.
Distant_Evaluation	She was a bright and vivacious young women who made it as a real estate agent in South Florida and then became a broker in New York City.
Distant_Evaluation	To friends and family, Berman was more than a murder victim, more than a drug addict whose tortured body was found in St. Petersburg’s Lake Maggiore.
Cause_General	She was those things, too, as became clear in a trial in June.
Main	Letrell McKnight and Santonio Smith were convicted of murdering Berman, 42, purportedly because Smith believed she had stolen shoes he planned to give his kids for Christmas.
Cause_General	A third man is awaiting trial.
Distant_Evaluation	But for people who knew Berman, the descriptions of her death ignore who she was for most of her life.
Distant_Evaluation	''My daughter was bright, she was generous, she was loving, she was fun, she was so much fun,'' said her mother Andrea Silverthorne.
Distant_Evaluation	''And through the whole descent into this vicious criminal world, it was very difficult, and I never gave up on her because my Stacia was still inside the new Stacia.
Distant_Evaluation	''But never, never in my imagination did I imagine how it would end.''
Distant_Historical	Berman grew up in the Miami area.
Distant_Historical	She enjoyed English classes and did well in school.
Distant_Historical	But in sixth grade she suffered a serious head injury in a bicycle accident and afterward had headaches and trouble concentrating.
Distant_Historical	Berman’s mother and father divorced, her father remarried, and eventually Berman gained a younger brother and sister.
Distant_Evaluation	''She was a wonderful older sister, played with them in a pool, sang to them, made up games,'' said her stepmother Kelly Charters.
Distant_Historical	Berman attended Coral Gables High School and got a GED.
Distant_Historical	She worked in nightclubs in South Beach, but her mother worried about that scene.
Distant_Evaluation	She knew her daughter had dabbled in drugs.
Distant_Historical	A successful South Florida real estate broker, Silverthorne helped her daughter study for her real estate license.
Distant_Historical	She beamed when Berman moved to New York City in the 1990s and became a real estate broker.
Distant_Evaluation	''That was like her Camelot time for six or seven years,'' Silverthorne said.
Distant_Evaluation	Berman cared deeply for animals, for the environment, for people affected by war, for many things.
Distant_Evaluation	She suffered ''not just her own wounds, but everyone else’s wounds,'' as Silverthorne put it.
Distant_Evaluation	Sometimes, it was hard for her to stop worrying.
Distant_Evaluation	''I think some of these things would keep her up at night,'' Charters said.
Distant_Historical	Then, in 2001, two planes crashed into the World Trade Center.
Distant_Evaluation	''It just put her over,'' Charters said.
Distant_Anecdotal	That week, a Washington Post reporter found Berman attending services at New York’s St. Patrick’s Cathedral.
Distant_Anecdotal	She seemed almost a church statue in full regalia.
Distant_Anecdotal	She wore an American flag bandanna in her hair, a flag pin on her black trench coat, a cross around her neck.
Distant_Anecdotal	She began to talk about the unspeakable tragedy, and could not stop.
Distant_Anecdotal	She shuddered, her teeth chattering.
Distant_Anecdotal	Her brown eyes were red.
Distant_Anecdotal	''It always takes something like this for us to pay attention to humanity, to politics, to religion,'' she said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''People I know could’ve died, and I may just not know it yet.''
Distant_Evaluation	Berman was not only suffering from depression brought on by the attacks but also a collapsing real estate market.
Distant_Historical	Silverthorne brought her back to Florida and put her to work in her business.
Distant_Historical	Berman’s good friend Pelli Llewellyn discovered Berman was using crack cocaine, a change from previous casual partying.
Distant_Evaluation	It scared Llewellyn.
Distant_Historical	After some soul-searching, she alerted Berman’s mother.
Distant_Historical	Silverthorne got her into rehab more than once, including a stint in St. Petersburg.
Distant_Historical	But Berman kept using and began getting arrested.
Distant_Historical	At one point, she confided what her mother had suspected: She turned to prostitution for more cocaine.
Distant_Evaluation	''It was a brutal thing to watch this middle-class child descend into this hard-core drug world,'' Silverthorne said.
Distant_Evaluation	And harder still when police told her what had happened in St. Petersburg on Christmas Eve 2011: Berman came to an apartment at 527 Eighth St. N for cocaine.
Distant_Evaluation	Smith thought she had stolen some shoes.
Cause_General	Smith, McKnight and another man were accused of torturing her, killing her and dropping her in Lake Maggiore.
Distant_Evaluation	Silverthorne appreciates the prosecutors who got McKnight and Smith convicted and sentenced to life, but she doubts parts of the official story.
Distant_Evaluation	She believes the murder was about more than shoes and that more people were involved.
Distant_Evaluation	She said her daughter had previously been found with a couple of $1,000 Walmart gift cards, indicating she may have been used as a drug courier.
Distant_Evaluation	''It wasn’t about shoes,'' Silverthorne said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It was about money.''
Cause_General	The convictions were welcomed by those who loved Berman.
Distant_Evaluation	Still, says Charters: ''I don’t think more than 12 hours can go by without my thinking of her and what they did to her.''

Main	BEIRUT - Islamist extremists in Syria’s insurgency killed 150 soldiers in a battle for control of an Aleppo suburb this week, including 51 who were executed after they had surrendered, according to a Syrian monitoring group that has been chronicling casualties and evidence of atrocities.
Main	The group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which sympathizes with the opposition and reports daily tallies of combat and violence from a network of contacts on the ground in Syria, corroborated its assertion Friday with a video posted on the Internet.
Main	The video, dated Wednesday, showed what appeared to be an execution ground, with dozens of lifeless bodies clumped against a wall pockmarked with bullet holes.
Main	The video’s authenticity could not be independently confirmed, but Rami Abdulrahman, the Syrian Observatory founder, quoted witnesses as saying 51 soldiers taken prisoner were later shot.
Distant_Evaluation	Among the total who had surrendered, he said, “very few were taken hostage.”
Cause_General	Abdulrahman said the killers were members of the Nusra Front and Ansar al-Khalafa al-Islamiya Brigade, among the many jihadist groups, some affiliated with al-Qaida and populated with foreign fighters, that have entered Syria to join the insurgency battling the forces of President Bashar Assad in the conflict, now in its third year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If his assertions are confirmed, the killings would rank among the worst mass executions carried out by the rebel side and could aggravate the image problems for the coalition of insurgent forces, which are riven by internal conflict and have been losing territory to Assad’s side in recent weeks.
Distant_Evaluation	At the United Nations on Friday, a delegation of Syrian opposition leaders met informally with Security Council members for the first time, to press their contention that Assad has no interest in negotiating a peace deal as long as he believes he is winning on the battlefield.
Distant_Evaluation	Delegation members told reporters they had asked Russia, the Syrian government’s most powerful foreign backer, to stop supplying weapons to Assad.
Distant_Evaluation	The delegation, led by the coalition’s newly elected president, Ahmed al-Jarba, met the day before with Secretary of State John Kerry during his visit to the United Nations and beseeched him to expedite U.S. military aid to opposition fighters.
Distant_Evaluation	Al-Jarba has publicly rejected any alliance with the jihadists who have joined the insurgency and has repeatedly stressed what he has called the coalition’s commitment to a pluralistic democracy in Syria should the opposition prevail.

Main	WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama on Wednesday nominated Caroline Kennedy to be ambassador to Japan, moving to give a scion of America’s most enduring political dynasty a diplomatic post that has often gone to political heavyweights.
Distant_Evaluation	In naming Kennedy, whose appointment had been rumored for months, Obama is keeping with a long tradition of rewarding important campaign supporters with plum embassies.
Cause_General	He recently nominated major fundraisers to be envoys in London and Berlin.
Distant_Evaluation	But Kennedy’s value to Obama has been less about money than mystique.
Distant_Historical	As the daughter of President John F. Kennedy, her imprimatur on his candidacy in 2008 - along with that of her uncle Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts - elevated him at a key moment against his better-known rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Distant_Evaluation	Kennedy, 55, a lawyer, author and director of numerous nonprofit organizations, has no special expertise in Japan.
Distant_Evaluation	But some experts said her lack of knowledge was outweighed by her connections to the Oval Office.
Distant_Evaluation	She shares that with other marquee figures who have been ambassadors to Tokyo, including former Vice President Walter F. Mondale; Howard Baker, a former senator and White House chief of staff; and Thomas S. Foley, a former speaker of the House.
Distant_Evaluation	“For those who say she doesn’t know a lot about Japan, I say 'sure,' but neither did Walter Mondale,” said Kurt M. Campbell, a Japan expert who was assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs.
Distant_Evaluation	“What you really want in an ambassador is someone who can get the president of the United States on the phone.”
Main	A lawsuit filed by Austin filmmaker Robert Rodriguez and the production company behind his film ''Machete’' accuses The Texas Film Commission of denying agreed-to financial incentives after the agency decided the film was ''inappropriate.''
Main	Machete Chop Shop Inc. says in a suit filed Saturday in Travis County that the commission backed out of partially reimbursing the cost of the film after coming under fire for its violence and depiction of Texans.
Distant_Historical	Before the movie was released in September 2010, anti-immigration groups were upset over the film’s trailer, citing its violent imagery and Robert DeNiro’s cartoonish role as a senator who kills illegal immigrants.
Distant_Historical	According to court documents, the producers’ application for a grant under the Texas Moving Image Industry Incentive Program was approved in May 2009, one month after Gov.
Distant_Historical	Rick Perry signed the program into law at Rodriguez’s Troublemaker Studios.
Distant_Historical	At the bill signing, Rod-riguez announced that the bill would allow him to make films in Texas, including ''Machete.''
Distant_Historical	The complaint states that former commission head Bob Hudgins verified that the script complied with content requirements and also claims he approved the incentive package.
Distant_Historical	Once filmmakers knew they had additional state funding, they increased their budget, the complaint says, banking on a state contribution of nearly $8 million.

Main	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia - After years of near total dominance in Cambodian politics, the party of Prime Minister Hun Sen won a relatively narrow victory in national elections Sunday as a resurgent opposition rode a wave of disenchantment with the prime minister’s 28 years in power.
Main	Khieu Kanharith, the Cambodian information minister, told news services that according to a preliminary count, the governing party won 68 seats, or about 55 percent of the National Assembly’s 123 seats.
Cause_General	In the assembly being replaced, the governing party controlled a commanding 90 seats.
Distant_Evaluation	“This is a historical day, a great day for Cambodia,” Sam Rainsy, an opposition leader who returned from exile in France nine days before the election, told a news conference.
Distant_Evaluation	“People came in great numbers to express their will and democracy seemed to move forward.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The opposition won 55 seats, or about 45 percent of seats in the assembly, which will make it harder for Hun Sen to impose his will.
Main_Consequence	After years of a splintered opposition, the election signaled the arrival, permanent or not, of a de facto two-party system in Cambodia.
Distant_Historical	The two largest opposition parties merged last year to form the Cambodia National Rescue Party.
Cause_General	The opposition challenged the governing party, the Cambodian People’s Party, with a strikingly populist platform calling for a sharp rise in civil servants’ salaries, monthly payments to those more than 65 years old, and an increase in the minimum wage.
Cause_General	It also included a guaranteed, government-set price for agriculture products, lower gasoline costs and free health care for the poor.
Distant_Evaluation	Hun Sen’s party, as well as many analysts, questioned whether the opposition would be able to pay for all the proposed measures.
Cause_General	But in a country with wide income disparities, where 40 percent of children under 5 years old are malnourished and where more than two-thirds of households lack a flush toilet, the opposition’s program resonated.
Cause_General	The opposition also highlighted corruption, land seizures and concessions of wide swaths of forest given to foreign companies, especially from China and Vietnam.
Cause_General	Election monitoring groups reported numerous problems with the election.
Distant_Evaluation	Supposedly indelible ink to prevent people from casting votes more than once, for example, was easily removed with lime juice or bleach, observers said.
Cause_General	And scores of voters were turned away because their names were not found on the list, causing minor scuffles at one Phnom Penh voting station.
Main	Katherine Seeber, a Wilton woman who was paroled 10 months ago after spending a dozen years in prison for the killing of her step-great-grandmother, was fatally stabbed in Queens, New York City police said.
Main_Consequence	Seeber’s boyfriend, Pedro Sanchez, was charged with second-degree murder Wednesday for the killing, said Detective Martin Tinspeechley.
Distant_Historical	It’s the same charge Seeber pleaded guilty to in 2000 for her role in the death of 91-year-old Ruth Witter in a robbery gone awry.
Distant_Evaluation	Both the attorney who defended Seeber for more than a decade and the prosecutor who sought to put her behind bars said Seeber’s death appears to be the final chapter in a life that all too often centered around abusive relationships.
Distant_Evaluation	The criminal case against Seeber was one of the lengthiest and most unusual legal sagas Saratoga County has ever seen.
Distant_Historical	Allegations surfaced that a veteran police investigator who committed suicide had mishandled evidence, a retrial was ordered and the case ultimately ended with a rarely used plea deal.
Distant_Evaluation	''It was probably one of the most complex cases we’ve seen, procedurally,'' said Saratoga County District Attorney James A. Murphy III, who took over as district attorney the year before Witter was killed.
Main_Consequence	Murphy said prosecutors in Queens called him about Seeber’s death late Wednesday night.
Distant_Evaluation	''It’s sad, especially in her context, but I can’t say I was surprised,'' Murphy said.
Distant_Evaluation	''She was very troubled her whole life.''
Cause_General	New York City police could not say what led to Seeber’s death.
Cause_General	She was found dead in her 55th Street home in Astoria Tuesday evening.
Distant_Evaluation	Police said Seeber had only known Sanchez a few months.
Cause_Specific	The New York Daily News reported Sanchez confronted Seeber, 32, about her seeing another man and then stabbed her in the torso and face with a kitchen knife.
Cause_General	Both the Daily News and the New York Post reported Sanchez tried to clean up the scene after killing Seeber.
Cause_General	In addition to murder, Sanchez was also charged with criminal possession of a weapon, evidence tampering and resisting arrest.
Cause_General	The parole program that oversaw Seeber’s release helped her find housing in Queens.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	John Cuilla, the recently retired Saratoga County public defender who represented Seeber since 2000, said Seeber planned on moving to Washington to live with her brother.
Distant_Evaluation	''It’s a tragic ending,'' Cuilla said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It appears that she just could not get out of that cycle of domestic violence.''
Distant_Historical	Seeber was raised in Rexburg, Idaho, a predominantly Mormon city of 17,000 on the eastern edge of the state.
Distant_Evaluation	There, Cuilla said, Seeber’s parents’ troubled marriage first exposed her to domestic violence.
Distant_Historical	A once-promising student who aspired to a career in the military, Seeber moved to the Capital Region in 1998.
Distant_Evaluation	Both prosecutors and Cuilla say Seeber, whose family said she never smoked or drank as a teenager out west, quickly fell in with the wrong crowd.
Distant_Historical	She started dating Jeffrey Hampshire.
Distant_Historical	The teenage couple spent most of their time partying.
Distant_Historical	During one binge in February 2000, Seeber and Hampshire went to Witter’s Mordella Road home in Colonie looking for items to steal and pawn for cash for a hotel party.
Distant_Historical	A struggle ensued.
Distant_Historical	Witter was strangled with an electrical cord.
Distant_Historical	The nonagenarian’s frozen body was found in a snowy ditch in Stillwater, her ankles and feet bound with tape, a gag in her mouth.
Distant_Historical	Though she was killed in Colonie, the case ended up in Murphy’s hands because the couple crossed into Saratoga County to dispose of the body.
Distant_Historical	After prosecutors said Seeber unknowingly led detectives to Witter’s body, both Seeber, then 18, and Hampshire, then 19, were charged with murder.
Distant_Historical	Seeber pleaded guilty.
Distant_Historical	Hampshire went to trial and was acquitted.
Distant_Historical	Hampshire, however, was already facing an unrelated burglary charge and would later be arrested for multiple felonies, including helping cover up a fatal hit-and-run crash.
Distant_Historical	Seeber first unsuccessfully appealed her murder plea in 2004 on the grounds that she was not in the house to commit another crime, a prerequisite for the murder charge.
Distant_Historical	Then, in 2011, Seeber appealed again when it was found that Gary Veeder, a veteran State Police forensic scientist, had processed some of the evidence in her case.
Distant_Historical	Veeder committed suicide in 2008 after State Police pressed him about his mishandling of dozens of cases.
Distant_Historical	Seeber’s conviction was overturned and a new trial was ordered.
Distant_Historical	Seeber, however, pleaded guilty to manslaughter and burglary under the rarely used Alford plea, which allows a defendant to maintain his or her innocence but admit that prosecutors likely could have proven criminal charges at trial.
Distant_Historical	Seeber was sentenced to 141/2 years in prison in May 2012, but was released later that July because of time served.
Distant_Historical	At her May 2012 sentencing, Seeber repeatedly apologized to Witter’s family and invoked religion, saying her life had been turned around and that she wanted to work with domestic violence victims after living through a lifetime of volatile relationships.
Distant_Evaluation	''I offer this to you not as an excuse,'' Seeber told Witter’s relatives at her sentencing.
Distant_Evaluation	''But as an explanation to all your questions for all these years.''
Distant_Evaluation	Both Murphy and Cuilla said that Seeber had changed since Witter’s killing.
Distant_Evaluation	''In 2000, she was a naive little 18-year-old girl who lived through domestic violence her whole life,'' Cuilla said.
Distant_Evaluation	He said he was dismayed that it appeared she had recently fallen into another abusive relationship with Sanchez.
Distant_Evaluation	''I thought she was ready to come out and be a productive member of society.''
Distant_Historical	Detectives who questioned Seeber in 2000 described her as unremorseful, cold and tough.
Distant_Historical	Hampshire’s lawyers portrayed Seeber as the mastermind behind Witter’s killing.
Distant_Historical	In 2005, Hampshire’s then attorney, Cheryl Coleman, described Seeber as ''the single most frightening sociopath I have ever met.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Murphy noted that not all victims of domestic violence end up as violent offenders themselves.
Distant_Evaluation	He also said he and Witter’s family still view Seeber as a killer.
Distant_Evaluation	''Ruth was a very elderly woman who was having her great granddaughter and a friend over for a visit, not to be robbed and killed,'' Murphy said.
Distant_Evaluation	''(Witter’s family) looked upon her as a cold and calculated person who manipulated her great grandmother to try and steal jewelry and money, and if she had to sacrifice (Witter’s) life to get those things that was how it was going to go.''

Main	The Tampa couple accused of kidnapping their sons at gunpoint and absconding on a sailboat across the Gulf of Mexico tried to formally seek asylum from Cuban authorities, asserting the lives of their children were at risk from U.S. government officials, one parent’s lawyer said Monday.
Cause_General	Joshua and Sharyn Hakken met with a lawyer in Cuba after arriving there in April, and were initially told they would be safe from U.S. law enforcement while their asylum application was reviewed, said Tampa lawyer Bryant Camareno, who is representing Sharyn Hakken.
Cause_General	''They sought counsel, and they actually met with a lawyer in Cuba,'' Camareno said.
Distant_Evaluation	''They felt that their kids’ lives were in danger from the (U.S.) government.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He said the couple also believed that if Cuba rejected them, they would have time to seek protection at other foreign governments’ embassies in Havana.
Distant_Evaluation	The couple’s dreams of a safe haven abroad were short-lived.
Cause_General	Within days of the Hakkens’ arrival at Hemingway Marina outside Havana, Cuban authorities gave the U.S. permission to apprehend the family and extradite them to Florida.
Cause_General	Both parents are jailed as they await trial in Hillsborough Circuit Court on charges including kidnapping and child abuse.
Distant_Evaluation	But the description of the Hakkens’ overtures to Cuban officials and fears of government intrusion in their boys’ lives provides an early glimpse of their mind-set and legal strategy.
Cause_General	Camareno’s remarks to the Tampa Bay Times, made after Joshua and Sharyn Hakken briefly appeared in court Monday, marked the first time the couple’s own account of their motives has emerged.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The argument that the Hakkens were attempting to extricate their sons from a tyrannical child welfare system also promises to bring more national attention to the bizarre saga of an American family driven by mistrust of government to seek refuge in the Western Hemisphere’s last communist country.
Cause_General	On April 3, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, Joshua Hakken, 35, kidnapped his children at gunpoint from the home of his mother-in-law, whom he bound with zip-ties.
Cause_General	He and Sharyn Hakken, 34, had lost custody of 4-year-old Cole and 2-year-old Chase after a series of incidents in Louisiana.
Cause_General	A court later terminated their parental rights.
Distant_Historical	Authorities said Joshua Hakken was arrested on drug charges in a hotel there last year, and was found with a gun talking about taking a ''journey to Armageddon’' in the presence of the boys when he was taken into custody.
Distant_Historical	The children were placed in foster care following the drug arrest, but Hakken showed up with a gun at their foster home demanding they be returned, according to authorities.
Distant_Historical	The foster parents called 911 and Hakken fled.
Cause_General	After the Hakkens’ extradition from Cuba, their sons were placed back in the custody of their grandmother, who lives north of Tampa.
Cause_General	Camareno said he and Jorge Chalela, Joshua Hakken’s attorney, are awaiting discovery materials from the Hillsborough State Attorney’s Office and are still in the early stages of reviewing the case.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But Camareno already expects to call witnesses from Cuba, and he said the case could involve international law and jurisdictional issues.
Distant_Evaluation	It is unclear what specific justification the Hakkens might have had for claiming special refugee status.
Cause_General	Cuba never signed the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention, the backbone of international protection for asylum-seekers.
Cause_General	The treaty obligates governments to harbor those who fear persecution in their home countries for their political views, race or religion, among other factors.
Distant_Evaluation	''They weren’t too sure of what type of asylum they were seeking,'' Camareno said, ''but they were seeking asylum.''

Main	Regulators are using new powers to crack down on a high-speed trading firm that they contend was trying to manipulate the prices of futures contracts.
Cause_Specific	The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Monday that it had set penalties of $2.8 million on Panther Energy Trading for a practice known as “spoofing,” in which bogus orders are used to draw in other traders.
Main_Consequence	The firm and its owner, Michael J. Coscia, were also barred from trading for a year.
Cause_General	The agency said it was the first case to be brought using new rules against spoofing contained in the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation.
Cause_Specific	In addition, British regulators imposed their own fine of $903,176 on Coscia, while the Chicago Mercantile Exchange set a penalty of $2.1 million on Panther Energy and Coscia, who was also banned from trading on its exchanges for six months.
Cause_General	A number of regulatory agencies have stepped up their scrutiny of high-speed trading firms, which are coming to dominate a growing number of financial markets.
Cause_General	On Friday, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority sent letters to 10 firms asking for information about their systems and controls.
Distant_Historical	Panther Energy Trading, based in Red Bank, N.J., engaged in the problematic practices for two months in 2011 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s electronic trading platform, according to the order filed by the futures commission.
Distant_Evaluation	The order said the firm and Coscia used computer programs to place orders to buy futures contracts, hoping to give other traders the impression that the price of a contract was heading higher.
Distant_Evaluation	Panther would sell contracts at that higher price before quickly canceling its buy orders, the commission said.
Distant_Historical	Panther used the strategy in 18 types of futures contracts, including those involving oil, natural gas and corn.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We will use the Dodd-Frank anti-disruptive practices provision against schemes like this one to protect market participants and promote market integrity, particularly in the growing world of electronic trading platforms,” the agency’s enforcement director, David Meister, said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	Bart Chilton, a commissioner with the agency who has been critical of high-speed trading, called the one-year trading ban inadequate.
Distant_Evaluation	Chilton said in a concurring statement that the violation “warrants the imposition of a much more significant trading ban to protect markets and consumers, and to act as a sufficient deterrent to other would-be wrongdoers.”
Cause_General	A person who answered the phone at Panther said the firm and Coscia had no comment on the case.
Main	WASHINGTON – A Mexican drug cartel member pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court here Thursday to the murder of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent Jaime Zapata of Brownsville during an ambush in Mexico.
Main	Julian Zapata Espinoza, 32, known as ''El Piolin’' or ''Tweety Bird,'' also pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of ICE special agent Victor Avila, according to Justice Department officials.
Cause_Specific	''Special agent Zapata died for his country in a senseless brutal attack, and special agent Avila was grievously wounded in the same ambush by members of the Los Zetas cartel,'' said Mythili(CQ) Raman(CQ), acting assistant U.S. attorney.
Cause_General	Following the plea, the federal court unsealed documents that revealed the guilty pleas of three other defendants in the Mexico ambush who were also charged with murder, attempted murder and racketeering.
Cause_General	Ruben Dario Venegas Rivera, 25 and Jose Ismael Nava Villagran, 30, pleaded guilty to murder and attempted murder.
Cause_General	Francisco Carbajal Flores, 38, pleaded guilty to racketeering.
Cause_Specific	Espinoza, Rivera and Villagran admitted to being members of a Los Zetas hit squad who participated in the Feb. 15, 2011 ambush of the special agents.
Distant_Historical	The agents were serving as ICE agents in Mexico when they were surrounded and forced off the highway while traveling between Mexico City and Monterrey, near San Luis Potosi.
Distant_Historical	Espinoza ordered the agents out of the vehicle.
Distant_Historical	When the agents refused and tried to identify themselves as American diplomats from the U.S. Embassy, the hit squad members fired into the vehicle.
Distant_Historical	The Zeta members continued to fire at the vehicle as the agents tried to escape by driving away.
Distant_Historical	Zapata died from gunshot wounds he suffered in the attack.
Distant_Historical	The suspects were later captured by Mexican authorities.
Cause_General	Espinoza was extradited to Washington to face murder and attempted murder charges.
Distant_Evaluation	Ronald Machen(CQ), the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said the attack on U.S. agents demanded ''an intense, dedicated and forceful response.''
Distant_Evaluation	Machen said the response served as a message to others that if you commit an act against a U.S. law enforcement agent in a foreign land, ''we will not forget, we will not falter and we will not rest until you are brought to justice.''
Cause_General	The 2011 attack on the two U.S. agents in Mexico also led to the arrest and conviction on weapons violations of a Dallas-area man, Otilio Osorio, who illegally sold a replica AK-47 assault rifle that was found at the murder scene.
Distant_Evaluation	The attack also prompted outrage in Congress.
Distant_Historical	A bipartisan bill passed last year, and spearheaded by Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Austin; Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Laredo; and Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Corpus Christi, authorized $10 million over five years for cross-border training for U.S. and Mexican law enforcement and military.
Distant_Historical	The bipartisan bill was named for agent Zapata, 32, who served in Laredo before he was transferred to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security investigations unit on human trafficking and smuggling in Mexico.
Main	WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama defied Republican critics Thursday by nominating to a high-ranking State Department job an official involved in editing controversial talking points about the attack last year in Libya.
Main	Obama sent the Senate his choice of Victoria Nuland, a former spokeswoman for the State Department, as assistant secretary for European and Eurasian affairs.
Distant_Evaluation	Nuland had long been in line for the position, but some had questioned whether the nomination would go forward after drafts of the talking points became public.
Cause_General	Nuland suggested revisions to talking points prepared by the CIA after the terrorist attack that killed four Americans at the diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11.
Distant_Evaluation	In an email, she urged deleting mention of past warnings of terrorism in Libya because lawmakers could use that “to beat the State Department for not paying attention.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Her confirmation hearings may serve to revive the furor.
Distant_Evaluation	But Nuland, a career Foreign Service officer, has strong ties on both sides of the aisle, having served as deputy national security adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney and ambassador to NATO under President George W. Bush.
Cause_General	Obama on Thursday also nominated Douglas E. Lute, his adviser on Afghanistan and Pakistan, to be the next ambassador to NATO, replacing Ivo Daalder, who is leaving the post this summer to become president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.
Cause_General	A career Army officer, Lute first went to work for Bush as his Iraq and Afghanistan war coordinator and stayed on under Obama, focused specifically on Afghanistan.
Cause_General	He retired as a lieutenant general in 2010, remaining in the White House as a civilian and helping shape the president’s plan to withdraw combat forces by the end of 2014.

Distant_Evaluation	During the three and a half years that she was held in prison or under house arrest, Judge Lourdes Afiuni became a symbol of political persecution for many in Venezuela under President Hugo Chávez.
Main	On Friday, a court in Caracas, acting at the government’s request, ordered Afiuni to be set free in the latest sign of a shifting political landscape in post-Chávez Venezuela.
Cause_Specific	Afiuni was jailed in December 2009 after issuing a court ruling that infuriated Chávez, who went on television and demanded that she be sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Cause_General	For years Chávez ignored international appeals for her release, including from the American leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky.
Distant_Historical	Chávez, a charismatic socialist, died in March, leaving a bitterly divided country.
Cause_General	His handpicked successor, Nicolás Maduro, was elected by a slim margin in April and since then has confronted political turmoil and serious economic difficulties that have tested his nascent leadership skills.
Distant_Evaluation	As Maduro lurches from one crisis to the next, the quality he seems to have honed most is delivering mixed messages at top volume.
Distant_Evaluation	He branded President Barack Obama “the big boss of the devils” and then sent his foreign minister to shake hands with Secretary of State John Kerry and call for warmer relations.
Distant_Evaluation	He assailed capitalists for causing soaring inflation and rampant product shortages and then sat down with the head of the country’s biggest private company to discuss the economy.
Distant_Evaluation	“There are lots of mixed signals,” said Elsa Cardozo, a professor of political science at the Central University of Venezuela.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is clear the government of President Maduro is in a situation that is forcing it to make some changes in direction.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	What we don’t know is if they are permanent changes or tactical changes.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Afiuni’s release may actually be intended to counter an opposition campaign to take its message abroad, with leaders visiting countries around the world to make the case that Maduro was unfairly declared the winner of a flawed election and that his government is repressive.
Cause_General	The opposition routinely points to Afiuni as the most prominent among a group of what it calls political prisoners.
Distant_Historical	Her lawyer, José Amalio Graterol, confirmed reports last year that she was raped while in prison, became pregnant and had an abortion, which led to other health problems.
Distant_Historical	She was moved to house arrest in Caracas in 2011.
Cause_General	Afiuni’s trial began in November and is continuing, although she has not attended it.
Main	NEW YORK - Fed up with what he views as a pattern of obstructionist behavior, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has taken the rare step of filing a lawsuit against the city comptroller, John C. Liu, for rejecting two municipal contracts.
Cause_General	The contracts would pay Aguila Inc., a company run by Robert V. Hess, Bloomberg’s former commissioner of homeless services, a total of $67.6 million to operate homeless shelters in the Bronx and Manhattan.
Distant_Evaluation	The Manhattan shelters have long been a target of criticism from local residents and elected officials, who say, among other complaints, that the area has an excess of similar facilities.
Cause_Specific	Liu rejected the contracts on July 3, saying they were too vague as to how many people would be offered services.
Distant_Evaluation	And in a criticism of Bloomberg’s record on homelessness, Liu argued that “it would be unconscionable to compound past errors with these faulty contracts.”
Main	But Bloomberg, in a lawsuit filed Thursday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, said the courts had long held that registration of contracts was “not a vehicle for the comptroller to usurp the mayor’s authority to enter into contracts.”
Distant_Evaluation	The lawsuit, believed to be only the second filed by the Bloomberg administration against the city or state comptroller’s office, is the latest and perhaps most pronounced skirmish between Bloomberg and Liu, a Democrat who is now running for mayor.
Distant_Evaluation	Administration officials contend that there is a discrepancy between the reasons Liu cites in his news releases for rejecting a contract and the public documents explaining the reasons.
Distant_Evaluation	Liu, the city contends, typically asks for more technical information, then registers those contracts with few if any changes and no public notification.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s a joke,” Marc La Vorgna, Bloomberg’s press secretary, said of Liu.
Distant_Evaluation	“Sad part is this is taxpayer resources and dollars being completely wasted on naked political ambitions.
Distant_Evaluation	He was running for mayor the second he stepped into this job and had no interest in doing the job he was sworn in to do, only to abuse the position.”
Distant_Evaluation	Aides to Liu argue that the comptroller needs to highlight certain Bloomberg proposals because the mayor has mishandled contracts, like those for the CityTime payroll project and for an overhaul of the 911 system.
Distant_Evaluation	“Under Mayor Bloomberg, spending on outside contractors has ballooned, and his outsourcing philosophy is out of control,” said Stephanie Hoo, a spokeswoman for the comptroller.
Distant_Evaluation	“In all cases, whenever this office has questioned contracts, it has been within the guidelines of the City Charter and our mandate to protect taxpayers from wasteful spending.”
Cause_General	In the rare cases where a mayor or a comptroller sues the other over contracts, the courts have held that comptrollers have extremely limited powers.
Distant_Historical	In 2006, the Court of Appeals rejected former Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.'s effort to void a contract on Snapple, writing that “the Charter establishes in plain language that the mayor and the corporation counsel - not the comptroller - bear the burden of determining that procedural requirements have been met and legal authority exists to award a concession contract.” (Thompson ran against Bloomberg in 2009 and is again seeking the Democratic nomination for mayor.)
Cause_General	Under the charter, the only basis for a comptroller to scuttle a contract is evidence of possible corruption in the contracting process.
Cause_General	In rejecting the shelter contracts, Liu mentioned not corruption, but concerns over inspections and certificates of occupancy.
Cause_General	Bloomberg administration officials cited more than a half-dozen instances in recent years in which Liu publicized a rejection of a contract, then quietly registered it.
Distant_Historical	In March 2011, for example, Liu rejected a $20 million deal on teacher recruitment, saying the timing was “curious at best” because of Bloomberg’s threat to fire teachers.
Distant_Historical	But the reasons for rejecting the contract pertained to data input and an incomplete insurance certificate.
Distant_Historical	Liu registered the contract that July, with minimal changes.
Distant_Evaluation	When asked about the discrepancies between press statements and public documents, Hoo did not directly address the issue, but rather alluded to the mayor’s maneuver to run for a third term in 2009.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is beyond ironic that Mayor Bloomberg’s Law Department is up in arms about adherence to the City Charter when no one in the history of New York City has shown such deep disrespect for the City Charter,” she said.
Distant_Evaluation	“If we’d followed the charter, he wouldn’t even be in office right now.”
Main	WASHINGTON - President Barack Obama plans to nominate James B. Comey, a former hedge fund executive and a former senior Justice Department official under President George W. Bush, to replace Robert S. Mueller III as the director of the FBI, according to a person with knowledge of the selection.
Cause_General	Comey, 52, was chosen for the position over the other finalist for the job, Lisa O. Monaco, who has served as the White House’s top counterterrorism adviser since January.
Cause_Specific	Some Democrats had feared that if the president nominated Monaco - who oversaw national security issues at the Justice Department during the attacks in Benghazi, Libya, in September - Republicans would use the confirmation process as a forum for criticism of the administration’s handling of the attack.
Distant_Historical	As deputy attorney general in the Bush administration, Comey was a critical player in 2004 in the dramatic hospital room episode in which the White House counsel, Alberto Gonzales, and Bush’s chief of staff, Andrew H. Card Jr., tried to persuade Attorney General John Ashcroft - who was ill and disoriented - to reauthorize a warrantless eavesdropping program.
Distant_Historical	Comey, who was serving as the acting attorney general and had been tipped off that Gonzales and Card were trying to go around him, rushed to Ashcroft’s hospital room to thwart them.
Distant_Historical	With Comey in the room, Ashcroft refused to reauthorize the program.
Distant_Historical	After the episode, Bush agreed to make changes in the program, and Comey was widely praised for putting the law over politics.
Distant_Historical	Comey graduated from the University of Chicago Law School in 1985, then had a meteoric rise at the Justice Department, culminating in his service as the department’s second-ranking official from 2003 to 2005.
Distant_Historical	While oversee the U.S. attorney’s office in Richmond, Va., Comey was asked in 2001 to take over the government’s foundering investigation of the 1996 terrorist bombing at Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia that killed 19 American service members.
Distant_Historical	The FBI director at the time, Louis J. Freeh, had urged Ashcroft to take the case away from federal prosecutors in Washington who had been investigating for five years but had not brought charges.
Distant_Historical	With a legal deadline looming over them, Comey and a colleague rapidly moved the case forward and within three months indicted 14 men.

Main	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. - President Barack Obama and China’s new president, Xi Jinping, arrived at a famed desert estate here Friday evening for their unusually informal weekend meeting, starting with discussions of security issues that bedevil them, including North Korea’s nuclear threat, on which the United States sees a chance at greater cooperation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On Saturday, officials said, the leaders plan to delve into economic issues, including the United States’ accusation that Beijing has encouraged or at least tolerated cyberattacks on U.S. systems in which business and military secrets were stolen.
Cause_General	On a day when the temperature here reached 110 degrees, Obama and Xi, along with their interpreters and closest aides, retreated to the comfort of the sprawling Sunnylands estate in nearby Rancho Mirage, built by the publishing magnate Walter H. Annenberg.
Distant_Evaluation	On the question of tensions with North Korea, inflamed this year by a series of belligerent statements and actions from its young leader, Kim Jong Un, the administration has welcomed what officials have described as a growing impatience in China - on the part of Xi in particular - with its longstanding ally in Pyongyang.
Distant_Evaluation	That has raised administration hopes of new cooperation.
Cause_General	China voted with the rest of the U.N. Security Council to impose new sanctions on North Korea after it tested a nuclear device in February.
Distant_Evaluation	And when a close adviser to Kim visited China last month, Xi bluntly told him that North Korea should resume international negotiations intended to force it to abandon its nuclear arsenal.
Distant_Evaluation	Xi also appears to have invested heavily in the meetings here with Obama.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Xi, who took office in March, told Obama’s departing national security adviser, Tom Donilon, who arranged the meetings, that the relationship between the United States and China had reached a critical juncture and that he wanted to develop “a new type of great power relationship.”
Cause_General	China also offered its own gestures in advance of the Sunnylands summit meeting on one of the prickliest issues with the United States: its treatment of human rights.
Cause_General	On Friday, only hours before the two leaders met, China granted passports to the mother and brother of Chen Guangcheng, the blind lawyer and activist whose flight from China last year turned into a diplomatic drama between the two countries.
Main	Regulators are taking a closer look at whether high-frequency trading firms might represent a threat to the stability of financial markets.
Main	The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, an industry-financed regulator, sent letters to 10 high-speed trading firms this week, asking them for more information about their trading programs and the steps they have in place to avert “market disruptions.”
Cause_General	The letter comes as regulators around the world are grappling with the role that high-speed trading firms have come to play over the last decade as they have grown to account for a majority of all trading in U.S. stocks.
Cause_General	These firms, which use high-speed computers and infrastructure to take advantage of small discrepancies in trading prices, have also taken an increasing role in trading in other markets.
Main	The letter sent out this week is focused primarily on the steps the firms take to test their programs, or algorithms, before they begin trading with them, and the preparations they take to deal with unexpected trading problems.
Cause_General	Regulators have been focused on these issues since one trading firm, Knight Capital, lost nearly $500 million and nearly went bankrupt after its trading programs went haywire last August.
Main	The letter also asks about efforts to monitor market “manipulation.” Earlier this year, FINRA said in an annual report that it was concerned about high-speed trading strategies that are “used for manipulative purposes.”
Main	NEW YORK - An administrator at a Manhattan high school admitted to having sex with four female students, according to a report by the New York City Department of Investigation.
Main	The administrator, Malik Taylor, 31, had sexual intercourse with students who ranged in age from 16 to 19, and also sexually harassed four other students while he worked as a community assistant and a dean at the high school, the Business of Sports School in Midtown, according to a report by the special commissioner of investigation for the city’s schools.
Cause_Specific	In an interview with investigators in June, Taylor admitted that he had had unprotected sex with students in motel rooms, in the back of his car and in classrooms after school.
Main	He made lewd comments about the size of students’ buttocks and breasts, and sent inappropriate text messages from a cellphone assigned to his wife, the report stated.
Main	He also asked one of the students to buy marijuana for him, it said.
Cause_Specific	Taylor emailed his resignation to the school’s principal, Joshua Solomon, in May, after one of the students told him that she had reported him.
Cause_Specific	That student told a teacher that she was having a sexual relationship with Taylor, and that she knew of others who were as well.
Cause_Specific	The teacher then told the school’s assistant principal, Rosa Choi, who notified the special commissioner’s office.
Cause_General	The city has referred the report to the district attorneys in Manhattan and Brooklyn for further action.
Cause_General	Attempts on Tuesday evening to reach Taylor, Choi and Solomon by phone and email were unsuccessful.
Distant_Evaluation	On Tuesday, the city’s Education Department said that Taylor’s actions were “completely reprehensible” and that he had been barred from teaching in the city.
Cause_General	Taylor worked at the school for about a year, and his salary was $32,000.
Main	One relationship started when a student came to Taylor to discuss personal problems, the report said.
Main	It stated that Taylor began talking to her in a sexual way, and then told her he wanted her to have his child.
Main	He and another student exchanged about 6,000 text messages during a three-month period, the investigation showed.
Main	That student said Taylor groped her in the school cafeteria and made inappropriate comments to her.
Main	She eventually agreed to have sex with him at a motel after he asked her for months to be intimate with him, according to the report.

Main	NEW YORK - Ronell Wilson, whose first death sentence for killing two undercover police detectives was overturned, was sentenced again Wednesday to die by a federal jury that heard gripping testimony about his time in jail, where he roamed freely after the shootings, intimidated fellow inmates and fathered a child with a guard.
Cause_General	The anonymous jury took just five hours to reach its decision to return Wilson to federal death row, where no other New Yorker has served time in six decades.
Cause_General	As the jury foreman responded to preliminary questions, Wilson, 31, slumped forward with his chin in his hands as the tension rose in the courtroom in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn.
Cause_General	When the foreman finally said “yes” to the death penalty, Wilson looked over to his family.
Cause_General	They wept as he was led away.
Distant_Evaluation	Rodney Andrews Sr., the father of one of the victims, Detective Rodney J. Andrews, said that he was pleased with the outcome.
Distant_Evaluation	“He’s proven that he’s not going to change,” Andrews said of Wilson.
Distant_Evaluation	Andrews said that he wanted to watch Wilson’s execution, and when asked why, he replied, “For satisfaction.”
Cause_General	The family of Detective James V. Nemorin, the other victim, did not attend court Wednesday.
Distant_Evaluation	In a statement, the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, said: “It was an assault on the society that those officers represented, and for that reason their murders had to be answered with the full force of punishment at society’s disposal.”
Cause_General	Wilson’s lawyers declined to comment.
Distant_Evaluation	Death penalty trials are exceedingly rare in New York, where the state’s highest court struck down the death penalty in 2004 and where capital cases at the federal level are often resolved before trial.
Distant_Historical	On March 10, 2003, Wilson killed Andrews, 34, and Nemorin, 36, who were participating in a sting operation to buy an illegal gun.
Distant_Historical	He shot each once in the back of the head at point-blank range on a secluded street on Staten Island.
Distant_Historical	Federal prosecutors vigorously sought the death penalty against Wilson, taking the case from state prosecutors when capital punishment at the state level was invalidated.
Distant_Historical	They won a death verdict in 2007, the first one in New York since 1953.
Distant_Historical	The 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals overturned his death sentence in 2010.
Cause_Specific	The panel commuted the sentence to life in prison without parole, but prosecutors decided to again seek death.

Main	WASHINGTON - The forces of President Bashar Assad of Syria have substantially stepped up their air attacks, exploiting a crucial offensive advantage against Syrian rebels, according to American intelligence reports.
Distant_Evaluation	The reports paint an increasingly dire picture of the war in Syria as top Obama administration officials met Wednesday to review military options to help the rebels reverse their deteriorating position.
Main	The Syrian military’s use of warplanes and helicopters has increased.
Cause_General	It has carried out at least 500 air to ground attacks against rebels and civilians in May, according to the intelligence reports, which were described by officials who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss them.
Cause_General	Several hundred transport flights moved Syrian government troops, allied Hezbollah fighters and supplies around the battlefield last month, the reports said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Obama administration has long insisted that Assad’s days in power are numbered and that it is only a matter of time before he is toppled.
Distant_Evaluation	But the intelligence reports indicate that the Assad government has regained the tactical initiative, drawing on Hezbollah fighters, Syria government militias and its advantage in heavy weaponry.
Cause_General	The government’s capture of Qusair, a major town near the border with Lebanon, has enabled Assad’s forces to cut an important rebel supply line.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Syrian government helicopters have been flying Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite fighters so they can join in an anticipated offensive to take control of Aleppo, Syria’s largest city, according to American officials and members of the Syrian opposition.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	One result of the changed fortunes on the battlefield, according to American officials, is that the credibility of the moderate Syrian opposition, which the United States has been publicly backing, may have been diminished and that extremist factions may gain influence.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Secretary of State John Kerry conferred here on Wednesday with the British foreign secretary, William Hague, who told reporters that Assad appeared determined to press the fight with the rebels with the help of Hezbollah and Iran.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“What we have been pushing for, all of us involved in this effort, is a political solution that ends the violence, saves Syria, stops the killing and destruction of an entire nation,” Kerry said.
Distant_Evaluation	“So it’s not a question to me whether or not the opposition can, quote, 'win.'
Distant_Evaluation	It’s a question of whether or not we can get to this political solution.”
Main	LONDON - Britain’s security agencies appeared headed for a period of deeply uncomfortable scrutiny after the government said Sunday that it had been aware for more than two years that one of the two men suspected of hacking an off-duty British soldier to death on a London street had ties to al-Qaida.
Main	A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed that the ministry had provided “consular assistance” in Kenya in 2010 to the man, Michael Adebolajo, 28, a British citizen of Nigerian descent.
Distant_Historical	He had been arrested by the Kenyan police on suspicion of planning to join al-Shabab, an extremist group in Somalia that Britain has classified as a terrorist organization.
Cause_General	Adebolajo and the other suspect in the London attack - Michael Adebowale, 22, also of Nigerian origin - have been under armed police guard in separate London hospitals since the attack Wednesday.
Cause_Specific	The soldier - Lee Rigby, 25 - was run down by a car on the sidewalk outside an army barracks, then attacked with meat cleavers.
Cause_General	Police officers arriving on the scene shot and wounded the two suspects.
Distant_Evaluation	The grisly brutality of the attack shocked Britain as few events have since the bombings on the London transit system on July 7, 2005, which killed 52 passengers and the four bombers.
Cause_General	Sunday newspaper headlines about the case focused on what the government knew about Adebolajo and Adebowale and why no action was taken that might have prevented Rigby’s death.
Distant_Evaluation	In a statement on Sunday, the Foreign Office spokesman sought to tamp down the controversy, saying that the office’s role in the events in Kenya in November 2010 was limited to consular assistance to Adebolajo, “as normal for British nationals.” It did not address the Kenyan government’s statements that Adebolajo, using a false name, had been arrested near the Somali border with five Kenyan nationals while carrying al-Shabab literature.
Cause_General	The statement also did not address a claim made on BBC television on Friday night that Adebolajo spoke of rebuffing an attempt by MI5, the British domestic security agency, to recruit him.
Cause_General	The claim was made by Ibrahim Hassan, a man who says he has links to Islamic extremist groups.
Cause_General	Hassan said Adebolajo had told him that the recruitment attempt was made after he was deported from Kenya.
Distant_Evaluation	British security officials quoted in the Sunday newspapers said that efforts to recruit Islamic extremists in such circumstances were common.
Cause_General	Hassan himself was arrested in the BBC studio immediately after the interview by Scotland Yard counterterrorism detectives, who said that the arrest was not connected to the killing of Rigby.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Hassan’s claims and his arrest added to a growing sense that inquiries into Rigby’s death are likely to delve into the murky world of the security agencies and their dealings with Islamic extremists.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A Parliamentary panel, the Intelligence and Security Committee, has said it expects to receive a preliminary report from the government on the attack this week.
Distant_Evaluation	Among the issues that the panel’s leading members have said they want to explore is whether MI5’s desire to penetrate groups with suspected terrorist ties had led to decisions not to prosecute people like Adebolajo under laws that bar Britons from engaging with terrorist organizations overseas.
Distant_Evaluation	Security officials have said that MI5 viewed Adebolajo as posing a “low risk” of potential terrorism and did think he needed close monitoring.
Cause_General	Security officials have also confirmed that Adebolajo, and to a more limited extent Adebowale, had been known to British security officials for several years because they took part in protests in Britain that were organized by extremist groups, some of which involved violent clashes with the police.
Distant_Evaluation	Newspapers in Britain have carried accounts saying that Adebolajo had been heard in mosques and community centers in south London calling for jihadist attacks in Britain.
Distant_Evaluation	Muslim community groups have condemned the killing of Rigby in unequivocal terms, and say that many British Muslims are deeply apprehensive over a number of incidents of hostile graffiti and invective since his death, despite appeals for calm from Prime Minister David Cameron, the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev.
Distant_Evaluation	Justin Welby, and other prominent figures.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Tensions may rise further this week, when post-mortem details on Rigby are expected to be made public.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The report may shed light on several aspects of the brutal attack that have seized public attention, including whether he was still alive after the car hit him, and whether he was beheaded, as some witnesses say.
Cause_General	The police have so far declined to address those questions.

Main	Rick Scott is the first governor in the history of Florida (and likely the last) to travel the state in his own personal jet.
Distant_Evaluation	He’s a one-man airline.
Distant_Evaluation	Air Scott.
Distant_Historical	As a candidate in 2010, Scott thought it was extravagant for taxpayers to pay for two state aircraft to transport politicians in the nation’s fourth-largest state.
Distant_Historical	Elect me, Scott promised, and I’ll get rid of those expensive toys.
Distant_Historical	He got elected and ditched both planes, which would have been impossible if Scott wasn’t rich enough to travel in style on his own nickel.
Cause_General	Selling the planes grounded other state officials, who must travel by car or fly on the rare scheduled commercial flights out of Tallahassee, which is often impractical.
Cause_General	In today’s Florida, the only elected official who gets to fly is the one who can afford it.
Cause_General	Everywhere Scott goes, he does it on his own aircraft at his own expense, and after nearly two-and-a-half years in office, he has decided he needs an upgrade.
Cause_General	Scott is selling his eight-passenger Hawker 400XP, made by Raytheon in 2004, for $1.495 million.
Cause_General	An ad for the jet on the website controller.com says the jet is in Bonita Springs and notes: ''Price reduction!
Cause_General	Sale pending.''
Cause_General	Scott’s new chariot is a 2008 Cessna Citation Excel, a 12-passenger twin-engine jet with a dropped aisle that offers enough headroom for Scott to stand tall in the cabin.
Cause_General	The Cessna is white with pink trim and the plane’s tail number ends with the letters ''AS,'' which can only stand for first lady Ann Scott (the old plane’s tail number ended with ''RS’').
Cause_General	The new plane, like the old one, is registered to a Naples holding company, Columbia Collier Properties, whose signatory on legal documents is Ann Scott.
Distant_Evaluation	The purchase price of the new plane was not immediately available, and it’s not the kind of information the governor’s office would willingly provide.
Distant_Evaluation	''The governor wants to travel the state as often as possible to listen to the concerns and ideas of Floridians,'' said Scott’s chief spokeswoman, Melissa Sellers.
Distant_Evaluation	Scott travels more often than his predecessor and possible future rival, Charlie Crist, who traveled at taxpayers’ expense.
Cause_General	In fact, the Republican Party of Florida, as part of a series critically examining Crist’s record, noted that Monday was the fourth anniversary of a Times/Herald story that cited his use of state aircraft to attract publicity at ceremonial bill-signing events while campaigning for the U.S. Senate.
Error	''^
Distant_Evaluation	By paying for all of his flight costs, Scott has saved taxpayers a bundle, but exactly how much is a mystery.
Cause_General	The governor’s office says it has no records reflecting the costs to operate and maintain his own plane.
Cause_General	Also not known is how much of a tax benefit Scott derives by using his jet for business purposes.
Cause_General	Scott doesn’t take a government salary, either.

Distant_Evaluation	Chief Executive Officer Helena Foulkes said the department store operator, which announced a joint venture in Europe with Austrian rival Signa Holding on Tuesday, will now focus on turning around the underperforming divisions.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’ve made some poor decisions over the last few years that have hurt (the Saks OFF 5th brand’s) profitability,” Foulkes, who became chief executive in February, told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	“But this is a business that fundamentally can be successful.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lord & Taylor was more challenging and a turnaround would take longer, she said, adding that changes could include smaller stores.
Cause_General	Hudson's Bay shares jumped 4.9 percent to $11.15 in early trading in Toronto, paring losses for the year to 3.6 percent.
Cause_General	The benchmark Toronto stock index .GSPTSE was down 0.1 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	Sluggish sales have dogged HBC as Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and other online retailers lure consumers away from department stores.
Cause_General	In all but one of the last ten quarters, the company has posted losses.
Cause_Specific	Hudson’s Bay reported a net loss of C$147 million ($112.65 million), or 62 Canadian cents a share, in its North American operations for the quarter ended Aug. 4.
Distant_Historical	That compared with a loss of C$100 million, or 55 cents, a year earlier.
Cause_Specific	Comparable sales in HBC’s department store group, which includes its Hudson’s Bay, Lord & Taylor and Home Outfitters banners, fell 3.8 percent, while sales at Saks OFF 5th, which offers discounted designer goods, dropped 7.6 percent.
Cause_General	Saks Fifth Avenue’s sales rose 6.7 percent.
Cause_General	Gross margins improved 240 basis points from the same quarter a year earlier, lifting adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to C$33 million from C$3 million a year ago, the company said.
Main	Including its European business, Hudson’s Bay reported a net loss of C$264 million, widening from C$201 million a year ago.
Cause_General	The European joint venture will merge HBC’s Galeria Kaufhof with Signa’s Karstadt brand to form the region’s third-biggest department store chain.
Distant_Historical	The companies said on Tuesday that their combined regional sales in 2017 were 5.4 billion euros ($6.25 billion).
Distant_Evaluation	The venture was the latest in the Toronto-based company’s efforts to boost its performance.
Distant_Historical	In June, it said it would sell its unprofitable online banner Gilt, and close up to 10 Lord & Taylor stores including its Manhattan flagship, whose building it agreed to sell to Softbank-backed WeWork Cos. last year.
Main	(Reuters) - Health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N said on Thursday it will sell its standalone Medicare prescription drug plan business to WellCare Health Plans Inc (WCG.N) as it seeks U.S. antitrust approval for a planned acquisition by CVS Health Corp (CVS.N).

Distant_Evaluation	The $69 billion CVS-Aetna deal would be the second large deal this year between insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, a consolidation the companies say will help rein in rising U.S. healthcare costs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	CVS said separately that it expects the Aetna acquisition to close in the early part of the fourth quarter of this year.
Cause_General	Rival insurer Cigna Corp’s (CI.N) $52 billion acquisition of Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, which was announced after the CVS-Aetna transaction, has already passed U.S. Justice Department scrutiny.
Cause_General	Aetna did not disclose the terms of the sale to WellCare but said that the Medicare pharmacy prescription plans, known as Part D plans, covered more than 2.2 million members.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The sale price is likely between $1 billion and $1.5 billion based on the number of members, BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch estimated in a research note.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He forecast the acquisition would add $3 billion to WellCare’s annual revenue and 50 cents to $1 per share to earnings starting in 2020.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Wall Street analysts expected Aetna to sell all or some of its Medicare prescription drug business ahead of its combination with CVS, the largest manager of pharmacy drug plans for the Medicare program for the elderly and disabled.
Cause_Specific	The sale to WellCare aims to avoid an antitrust lawsuit over the amount of control it would have over the Medicare prescription drug market.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Aetna said the asset sale is a “significant step” in the U.S. Justice Department review and that its closing is contingent on that antitrust approval.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said that the sale of the entire business “almost certainly ensures approval by the DOJ,” or Justice Department.
Distant_Evaluation	Selling the entire business also ensures a more seamless handover to WellCare, she said.
Cause_General	WellCare, which specializes in government Medicare and Medicaid insurance plans, has only a small Medicare prescription drug plan business with about 4 percent market share, according to a recent research note from Barclays.
Cause_General	CVS has a 24 percent market share and Aetna has 8.7 percent, according to Barclays.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	WellCare said it does not expect to recognize revenue from the deal until 2020 because the terms call for Aetna to provide administrative services and retain the financial risk related to the government plans through 2019.
Cause_General	WellCare shares rose 4 percent to $319.76, Aetna added 0.7 percent to $203.13, and CVS was up 0.6 percent to $78.93.
Cause_General	IN the five years since the last farm bill was passed, the number of farmers' markets in this country has grown to nearly 4,500 from 2,750, gladdening the hearts of foodies who like nothing better than seeing locally grown Chioggia beets, butter radishes, Early Girl tomatoes, miniature pattypan squash, chervil, fresh goat cheese logs and duck breast in a conveniently located market.
Distant_Evaluation	Some of the best customers of farmers' markets, though, haven't been free-spending foodies, but food-aid recipients.
Main	Happily, the new farm bill before Congress has several proposals to vastly increase food aid to the poor, including two programs that allow them to buy at farmers' markets.
Distant_Evaluation	That normally would be great for small farmers.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Without the guaranteed income from the farm bill's $15 million Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program and the separate $25 million Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (part of the food aid program for families known as WIC), some small growers would be out of business, and many others would be reluctant to sell in low-income neighborhoods where fresh produce is otherwise a rarity -- ''food deserts.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But, it turns out, new efforts to encourage food-aid recipients to eat more fruits and vegetables -- which are calamitously underrepresented in American diets -- could end up shutting out the small farmers who are the backbone of these markets.
Main	The Agriculture Department has proposed rules that would reallocate WIC benefits now restricted to eggs and dairy products, which have long enjoyed the muscle of well-financed lobbies, to fruits and vegetables, which haven't.
Cause_General	Millions of children would be entitled to $6 a month for produce.
Main	And in its initial proposals for the new farm bill, the Bush administration suggested making available $200 million, starting next year, to buy fruits and vegetables for the poor.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If such suggestions get approved, hundreds of millions more dollars could be spent every year on fresh produce.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There's a big catch, though: small farmers might not reap the windfall.
Cause_General	Over the past 15 years, most states have switched from paper coupons for food stamps to debit cards, removing the stigma of redemption at the checkout counter.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The WIC program, which still uses paper, will most likely do the same.
Distant_Evaluation	Most farmers, of course, don't take plastic -- and, market managers say, they have seen their sales plummet with the switch from paper.
Distant_Evaluation	The need for farmers to enter the cashless economy is obvious.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Wireless card readers will benefit both people on food assistance and foodies who (like me) don't carry all the cash they end up eager to spend.
Distant_Evaluation	But who will pay for the machines, which can cost as much as $1,500 and incur steep monthly service fees, not to mention workers trained to use them?
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Without card readers, farmers fear they will lose the bulk of the farm bill help they get now, and be shut out of those new hundreds of millions.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The proposals at the Agriculture Department and in the farm bill would let food-aid recipients buy fruits and vegetables wherever they can find them.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That means supermarkets -- which remain the most convenient place to buy produce.
Distant_Evaluation	Farmers' market advocates are alarmed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The money will go to the centralized industrial farms that supply supermarkets, they say -- the ones that crush small farmers and waste fuel.
Distant_Evaluation	So: Help small farmers and the places dedicated to selling truly local food, or help the sharply increasing number of people struggling to feed themselves and their families?
Distant_Evaluation	The most equitable way to help farmer's markets may be to urge legislators to support good programs already in the farm bill, like the Farmers' Market Promotion Program and Community Food Projects.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	These could equip farmers with card readers, an essential first step, and finance other ingenious projects to help small farmers thrive.
Distant_Evaluation	Concerned cooks (and everyone else) should urge increases for education programs that tell people how and where to use food stamps.
Cause_General	Only 56 percent of people eligible for food stamps get them, and most of those recipients don't know that the stamps can be used at farmers' markets.
Distant_Evaluation	A reason often given for the great success of the WIC farmers' market program is the nutrition education that comes with it.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Yes, supermarkets may well get the great majority of increased benefits for fresh produce.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But a small slice of a much larger pie could amount to as much as or more money than farmers' markets now get from food-assistance programs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And the new money available for fruit and vegetables would mean that ''specialty crops'' -- the kind we actually think of as food, as opposed to crops like corn, soy and cotton that get the much criticized multibillion-dollar commodity subsidies -- would finally get support from the farm bill.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	More people would eat healthier diets, and farmers might start growing even better-tasting varieties, confident of finding a market.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Many other programs proposed for the farm bill could bring locally grown food to places that want and need it, like schools and hospitals.
Distant_Evaluation	But farmers' markets are where the bill can best serve cooks -- a frequently well-financed, always opinionated special-interest group that should start acting like one.

Main	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Global equity markets fell on Monday amid unease over the impact of the U.S.-China trade war on China’s growth, while the dollar gained against the euro as Italian bond yields spiked on a brewing spat over Italy’s budget plans.
Cause_General	European markets slid, with defensive stocks under pressure as investor confidence took a hit from last week’s spike in Treasury yields and heightened expectations for further U.S. interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
Cause_General	On Wall Street, the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell for the third straight day though the broad S&P 500 pared losses to end nearly flat as defensive stocks offset a decline in growth shares.
Distant_Evaluation	“Growth stocks are so sensitive to global growth expectations,” said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Any time you see concern about that, you’ll see the reversal of that trade.”

Cause_General	For the year, Chinese indexes are down about 18 percent.
Cause_General	Yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note were at seven-year highs after a solid U.S. jobs report last week raised the likelihood of faster interest rate hikes.
Distant_Evaluation	“There’s a hangover from last week’s rapid move in yields and just because the bond market’s closed, doesn’t mean investors are not worried,” said Michael Antonelli, managing director, institutional sales trading at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee.

Cause_General	Italy’s borrowing costs soared as a war of words between Rome and the European Union over the country’s budget plans escalated, with the deputy Italian prime minister denouncing officials of the European Commission as enemies of Europe.
Cause_General	Brazil’s real currency hit a two-month high and stocks jumped after market-preferred presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro’s strong first-round win on Sunday boosted investor confidence.
Cause_General	The real jumped 3.4 percent at one point before paring gains to trade at less than a 2 percent rise, and the Bovespa index jumped 4.69 percent.
Cause_General	Gold fell more than 1 percent as investors sought refuge in the dollar, which has been lifted by recent strong U.S. economic data that has reinforced rate hike expectations.
Cause_General	Gold is down more than 12 percent from an April peak largely due to a strong dollar, which reflects a vibrant U.S. economy, rising U.S. rates and fears of a global trade war.
Cause_General	U.S. gold futures settled down 1.41 percent at $1,188.60 an ounce.

Main	(Reuters) - Activist investor Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point LLC has demanded access to a trove of records from Campbell Soup Co, ranging from board meeting minutes to financial documents, as it ratchets up a campaign to replace the company’s board of directors, according to a letter seen by Reuters.
Error	FILE PHOTO: The logo and ticker for Campbell Soup Co. are displayed on a screen on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., May 18, 2018.
Error	REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo
Distant_Evaluation	Third Point’s move offers an example of the legal tools shareholder activists are increasingly using to boost their chances of winning proxy contests against corporate boards.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Such maneuvering could prove crucial in this case, given Third Point, which owns 5.65 percent of the canned soup maker, faces challenges in wooing some key shareholders.
Cause_General	Descendants of former Campbell Soup Chairman John Dorrance own a combined 42 percent stake in the company, representing a major hurdle.
Cause_General	Third Point gave the U.S. company five days to provide it access to several, typically confidential, documents, pertaining to its recently completed strategic review, its mergers and acquisitions activity, and succession planning for its chief executive, according to Third Point’s “demand letter,” dated and delivered to Campbell Soup on Wednesday.
Cause_General	In the letter, the hedge fund cites a New Jersey statute that gives shareholders the right to review company documents, provided they demonstrate a “proper purpose” for looking at the records.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This sets the stage for a legal battle with Campbell Soup, should it refuse access to the records.
Cause_General	Campbell Soup, based in Camden, New Jersey, did not respond to a request for comment on how it would respond to Third Point’s demands.
Main_Consequence	In a press release it published on Thursday to urge shareholders to back its board, the company said that it “strongly objects to Third Point’s aggressive and short-sighted tactics”.
Cause_General	Third Point declined to comment.
Cause_General	Campbell Soup shares were up 1.2 percent at $36.94 in early morning trading in New York on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of $11.1 billion.
Cause_Specific	Last month, Third Point unveiled a slate of nominees to replace all twelve of Campbell’s directors, alleging the company has been mismanaged for years.
Distant_Evaluation	The company’s share price is now 30 percent lower than it was 20 years ago, Loeb said, adding that executives failed to explore all strategic options, including the sale of the company.
Distant_Evaluation	Campbell has disputed this, arguing that its recently concluded strategic review considered every possibility.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The company has said it currently plans to sell only its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units, as it focuses on improving its operational performance.
Cause_General	The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Jeff Dunn, the former president of Campbell’s fresh food unit, is leading a consortium of investors that is in talks to buy that division for between $500 million and $700 million.
Distant_Evaluation	DECISIONS ON ACQUISITIONS
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Third Point said it needs to see Campbell documents to determine whether board directors or employees violated their fiduciary duty.
Distant_Evaluation	In its letter, Third Point seized on comments made last month by Campbell’s interim CEO, Keith McLoughlin.
Distant_Evaluation	McLoughlin, who took over when CEO Denise Morrison exited abruptly in May, had said the firm relied too much on acquisitions and lacked a culture of accountability, that led to poor execution.
Distant_Evaluation	“These admissions demonstrate that shareholders are entitled to the records of the company’s decision-making processes to investigate this unquestionable mismanagement and further instances of wrongdoing,” according to Third Point’s letter.
Distant_Evaluation	Among the things Loeb wants to find out is how the company went from saying that its $6 billion acquisition of Snyder’s-Lance would be accretive to earnings only to reverse itself and say it would be modestly dilutive to earnings.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is unfathomable that Campbell management could improperly represent to shareholders that the largest acquisition in the company’s history would be accretive and just five months later admit that they blew it,” the letter said.
Cause_General	Third Point is also asking for details about what the board planned to do after Morrison stepped down, including hiring a headhunter and any information on potential CEO candidates.
Distant_Evaluation	“Given Ms. Morrison’s disastrous performance, the board should have been acutely focused on trying to identify a qualified replacement well before her separation,” the letter said.
Distant_Evaluation	Campbell, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies.
Distant_Evaluation	It is not clear if any company would buy Campbell in its entirety.
Cause_General	Kraft Heinz Co has considered an acquisition of Campbell in the past, sources have told Reuters, but there is no sign of any recent approach from the company.
Distant_Evaluation	PLEDGED SHARES
Cause_General	Third Point’s records request also covers any information related to board director Bennett Dorrance, who has held his seat since 1989 and was granted a waiver to stay after reaching the mandatory retirement age of 72.
Distant_Evaluation	Third Point is interested in finding out why Dorrance, a grandson of former company chief John Dorrance, has not moved more quickly to reduce the loans he took for which he pledged roughly $500 million of his Campbell shares as collateral.
Distant_Evaluation	Pledging or loaning out shares creates questions about whether the shares can be voted and if “directors’ interests are truly aligned with those of shareholders,” the letter said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Campbell said on Thursday it will hold its annual shareholder meeting, where investors will vote on the board directors, on Nov. 29.
Distant_Evaluation	It is not clear whether any legal dispute over Third Point’s demand for company documents would be resolved by then.
Cause_General	Investors who hold Campbell shares as of Oct. 9 will be eligible to vote at the shareholder meeting, the company said.
Main	Clear Channel Communications, the nation's largest radio broadcaster, said last night that its board had rejected a revised offer by two equity firms that had agreed to buy the company, but are now trying to keep the deal from falling through.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The new offer was a last ditch attempt to save the deal from being voted down by shareholders next week, but now means the buyout is almost certain to be rejected.
Cause_Specific	Clear Channel said that the two firms -- Bain Capital Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners -- had proposed increasing their bid from $39 a share to $39.20 and allowing shareholders to own a stake once the company goes private.
Cause_Specific	That would allow shareholders to participate in any profit from a sale or initial offering in several years.
Cause_Specific	The buyout firms had offered shareholders up to 30 percent of the company after it became private.
Cause_Specific	The proposal came just days after Institutional Shareholder Services, the influential proxy advisory firm, recommended that shareholders reject the $39 a share bid, effectively killing the deal.
Cause_General	Before making the latest proposal, Bain and Thomas H. Lee consulted Highfields Capital Management, one of Clear Channel's biggest shareholders that had planned to vote against the deal, according to people involved in the talks.
Distant_Evaluation	Highfields had agreed to vote in favor of the deal, these people said.
Cause_Specific	But, Clear Channel said last night that in determining to reject the proposal, ''significant shareholders of the company have privately or publicly made known their opposition to the merger at $39 per share and their lack of interest in stub equity,'' referring to the stake that shareholders could have kept under the plan.
Cause_General	Stub equity was recently introduced to shareholders in the United States as a way to placate shareholders who had watched new owners of buyouts reap large profits by flipping the companies a few years later.
Cause_General	Just last month, shareholders of Harman International Industries, the maker of JBL speakers and Harman Kardon home theater systems, accepted a stub equity deal from buyout firms that included Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Goldman Sachs.
Cause_General	Interestingly, Goldman Sachs is the adviser to Clear Channel that recommended the board reject the most recent proposal that also used stub equity.
Cause_General	Under the terms of the latest proposal, the buyout firms would have financed the 20 cent a share increase by having the Mays family, which founded Clear Channel, receive $37.60 a share, which was the price the company had originally accepted last November before the buyout firms raised their offer to $39 a share in a failed attempt to appease shareholders.
Cause_General	The Mays recused themselves in the vote over the new offer, Clear Channel said.
Cause_General	The shareholder vote is Tuesday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some investors are now expecting the company to pursue a recapitalization, and some shareholders could mount a proxy fight.
Main	(Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp SHLD.O Chief Executive Eddie Lampert, a major investor in the company, has proposed rescue deals to help the department store chain avoid bankruptcy as debt matures next month and it faces a cash crunch, according to a regulatory filing released on Monday.
Error	FILE PHOTO: A Sears logo is seen inside a department store in Garden City, New York, U.S. on May 23, 2016.

Distant_Evaluation	Billionaire Lampert, who also runs hedge fund ESL Investments Inc, said the 125-year-old department store chain should take steps reduce its debt load to $1.2 billion from $5.6 billion.
Cause_General	Lampert and his hedge fund, which he controls, own about 50 percent of Sears, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Distant_Evaluation	Lampert said Sears should offer creditors options to extend their debt or exchange it for new holdings, giving Sears more time to turn its business around.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lampert said the company should continue selling real estate to reduce debt by $1.5 billion and that ESL would be a back-up bidder for the properties.
Cause_General	Sears said it has referred Lampert’s proposal to a special committee.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In an internal message seen by Reuters, Sears said, “We will now be working aggressively to execute liability management transactions so that we can extend our runway and continue executing on our transformation strategy.”
Cause_General	The proposals came as a Sears special committee weighs a prior offer from Lampert to acquire the retailer’s Kenmore appliances brand and its home services business for as much as $480 million.
Distant_Evaluation	Sears warned this month it could go out of business as it waits for approval from the committee on the deal.
Cause_General	The U.S. government agency overseeing the pensions of 100,000 of the company’s former workers must also approve a sale of Kenmore.
Cause_General	Sears’ shares, worth $30 in 2015, were down 3 percent at $1.24 Monday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings Inc said it viewed Lampert’s proposed deal as “challenging to execute.” Even if the deal is done, Sears would still need significant cash to operate because of challenges in retail, the ratings agency said.
Cause_General	In recent decades, Sears, which was the world’s largest retailer in the 1960s, has struggled in the face of declining foot traffic at its brick-and-mortar stores.
Distant_Historical	In another attempt to avoid bankruptcy, money-losing Sears last year sold its Craftsman tool brand to power tool maker Stanley Black & Decker (SWK.N) for $900 million.

Main	NEW YORK, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- Qatar's announcement Monday to withdraw from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) sparked investors' concerns over a more volatile policy-making in the global oil market, amid persistent fears of oversupply and shrinking demand shown in constant price slides over the last two months.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""The high volatility and large down move of the last 60 days will have a lasting impact on trading going into first quarter of 2019,"" said Albert Helmig, CEO of Grey House, a private consulting firm focused on market structure, risk management and price models."
Distant_Evaluation	CONCERNS BUILD UP
Main	Qatar's decision to end its 57-year membership in the oil cartel on Jan. 1, 2019 came three days ahead of a meeting between the Saudi-led OPEC and its allies to reshape global oil policy to grapple with broad price drops.
Cause_General	Qatar's Minister of Energy Saad al-Kaabi told press that Doha would still attend OPEC's upcoming meeting on Thursday and Friday in Vienna.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We are not saying we are going to get out of the oil business, but it is controlled by an organization managed by a country,"" said al-Kaabi."
Distant_Evaluation	"Al-Kaabi added that it would not be practical for Doha to ""put effort and resources and time in an organization"" in which Qatar was ""a very small player, and didn't have a real say in what happens."""
Distant_Evaluation	"The decision ""does come at a time when OPEC needs to hammer out a deal in the face of market skepticism in the cartel's ability to control production,"" said Ann-Louise Hittle, head of Macro Oils at Wood Mackenzie, an Edinburgh-based global energy research and consultancy firm, in a press release."
Distant_Evaluation	"Hittle also pointed out that as the smaller nations of OPEC have a relatively passive role in the group's decision-making, ""Qatar may also see that it has less to gain from its membership."""
Cause_General	The move exposed the deepening rift between Qatar and its Gulf neighbors since June 2017, when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and others severed diplomatic ties with Qatar.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Doha's quitting OPEC consequently gave rise to concerns that Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United States, the world's top three oil producers, would gain more control over global oil policy-making, as geopolitics has been one of the main drivers behind oil prices.
Cause_General	Russia has recently shown its willingness to cooperate with OPEC in a potential oil output cut in the face of U.S. calls for a further pullback in oil prices.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Investors had worried that Saudi Arabia would avoid confronting the United States over oil prices.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Prior OPEC-Russian efforts to cut production were effective for as long as a year, but ultimately the result is loss of market share to the United States and a return to low prices,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at U.S. securities broker firm FTN Financial, in a note to media."
Distant_Evaluation	"Helmig said that despite investors' anticipation of an OPEC announcement of a production cut, the market has been very cautious and ""awaiting more details of size and timing of a production change."""
Cause_General	BIGGEST LNG PRODUCER
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Analysts said Qatar's decision would not have a significant impact on oil prices as its production accounts for only 2 percent of OPEC's total output.
Cause_General	Yet the smallest Middle East oil producer in OPEC is currently the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Al-Kaabi said his country plans to increase LNG output to 110 million tons per year by 2024, calling Doha's withdrawal decision part of a long-term strategy.
Distant_Evaluation	Energy market watchers believed that Doha's latest move indicated that the small Gulf nation is seeking dominance in the global LNG market.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Qatar's OPEC exit underlines the country's aim to maintain its place in the global LNG market,"" said Lynn Morris-Akinyemi, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie."
Distant_Evaluation	Helmig also said the decision made sense given the volatile nature of global geo-politics.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Within the complex geo-politics inside OPEC and the focus on oil, the Qatari position is not a surprise."
Distant_Evaluation	"Their stated position is to focus on expanding their LNG portfolio."""

Cause_General	Agriculture contributes to the extent of 18 percent towards India's gross domestic product (GDP), even as the country accounts for nearly 7 percent of total global agricultural output.
Distant_Historical	As per the fourth advance estimates (released in August) for the year 2017-2018, total food grains production in the country was estimated at 284.83 million tons which was higher by 9.72 million tons than the previous record production of foodgrain of 275.11 million tons achieved during 2016-2017.
Distant_Evaluation	However, despite all this rosy picture, farmers in India are a dejected lot these days, and are venting out their anger against the government's policies, which they allege, overlook their interests and basic needs.
Distant_Evaluation	Barely able to recover their basic costs, the farmers allege that agriculture is fast turning into an unfeasible activity.
Distant_Anecdotal	Fed up after not being able to sell his onion produce of around 750 kg at a price more than 1.41 Indian Rupees (around 2 cents) per kg, a farmer in India's southwestern state Maharashtra sent whatever money he could receive by selling his total produce to Prime Minister Narendra Modi through a money order as a mark of protest and to highlight the farmers' plight.
Distant_Anecdotal	"Sanjay Sathe, the farmer from Maharashtra's Nasik district, reportedly said, ""I produced 750 kg of onion this season but was offered a rate of one Indian rupee per kilogram at Niphad wholesale market last week."
Distant_Anecdotal	Finally I could negotiate a deal for 1.40 Indian rupees per kilogram and received 1,064 Indian rupees for 750 kg.
Distant_Anecdotal	It was painful to see such paltry returns on four months of toil.
Distant_Anecdotal	Hence I have donated 1,064 Indian Rupees to Prime Minister Disaster Relief Fund as a protest.
Distant_Anecdotal	"I had to pay additional 54 Indian rupees for sending it by money order."""
Distant_Anecdotal	"Interestingly, Sathe was among the selected few ""progressive farmers"" who were picked by the Union Agriculture Ministry in 2010 to interact with former U.S. President Barack Obama during the latter's visit."
Cause_General	Strangely, while on one hand, the farmers are not able to recover their bare minimum cost, on the other hand, the retailers are openly selling the same commodity at least 20 times the cost which is paid to the farmers, thereby reaping heavy profits.
Distant_Anecdotal	Sribhagwan Singh, a farmer in Kanganheri village located in southwest Delhi, laments that he grew garlic on his farms and reaped a harvest of around 800 kg, but is not able to sell it in the market as he is getting a price of not more than 10 Indian rupees per kg.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""The bare minimum cost which I incurred in growing this garlic produce was at least 25 Indian rupees per kilogram."
Distant_Anecdotal	For over the past three months I have been contacting vendors in big vegetable markets in and around Delhi, but not able to find a buyer of my produce for more than 10 Indian rupees per kilogram.
Distant_Anecdotal	"The final conclusion is that farming is a loss making entity in India, and farmers have no option but to quit it and look for some alternative source of income,"" he told Xinhua."
Distant_Anecdotal	He added that the same garlic was being sold in retail market in Delhi and surrounding areas at the rate of 150 Indian rupees per kg.
Main	Only a few days ago, thousands of farmers congregated in Delhi from across the country and carried out a two-day agitation against the central government, demanding loan waivers and increase in minimum support prices (MSPs) for their agriculture produce.
Distant_Evaluation	Due to big amounts of loans standing in their names and finding no possibilities of getting a stable income from agriculture, the farmers are driven to a situation where they find no alternative but to commit suicides.
Cause_General	Farmers suicides has a major cause of concern in India for many years now, with the state of Maharashtra being on top.
Distant_Evaluation	The country's Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, however, claims that the number of farmers suicides in on the decline.
Distant_Historical	A couple of months ago he informed the parliament that the number of farmers suicides and agricultural laborers during 2016 had come down approximately by 9.77 percent compared to the previous years.
Distant_Historical	"""The number of suicides has come down from 12,602 in 2015 to 11,370 in 2016,"" he was quoted as saying."
Distant_Historical	The maximum number of these suicides were reported from the state of Maharashtra.
Cause_General	The main reasons behind agriculture being a loss making activity in India is the large dependence on monsoons and lack of use of modern farming techniques.
Cause_General	Due to non-availability of water resources round the year, a large chunk of farmers depend on monsoon rains.
Cause_General	At times, due to poor rains, or floods caused by excess rains, standing crops get damaged thereby resulting in huge losses to the farmers.
Cause_General	Besides, use of traditional farming methods and non-acceptance of modern equipment and techniques, also results in poor produce in terms of yield per hectare, as compared to other countries.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In a bid to address the farmers' woes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced that a new agriculture export policy will be unveiled soon to boost farm income as the government was on track to achieve the target of doubling farmers' income by 2022.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The main thrust of the policy would be fixing the minimum support price (MSP) of crops at least 1.5 times of the cost of production.
Cause_General	The Crop Insurance Schemes have been in place as a means of protecting the agriculturist against financial losses due to uncertainties that may arise from crop failures or losses arising from named or all unforeseen perils beyond their control.
Cause_General	One such scheme - Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) (or, Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme) aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture sector by way of providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events; stabilizing their income to ensure their continuance in farming; encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices; ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture sector which will contribute to food security, crop diversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides protecting farmers from production risks.
Distant_Evaluation	Amidst all this, the farmers community in India continues to live in abject poverty in the hope of seeing the government's polices yielding results on the ground on fine day.
Main	COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Orsted (ORSTED.CO), the world’s largest offshore wind developer, said on Monday it would buy U.S.-based Deepwater Wind LLC for $510 million as part of its strategy to expand in a major growth market.
Distant_Evaluation	The still small U.S. offshore wind sector is seen as one of the most important markets outside the core European region, where subsidies that have underpinned the industry since the early 1990s are starting to be wound back.
Cause_General	Deepwater Wind, the builder of the only operating U.S. offshore wind farm, has a portfolio with a capacity of around 3.3 gigawatts (GW).
Cause_General	Orsted’s U.S portfolio currently has a capacity of 5.5 GW.
Cause_General	Orsted has so far lost out on auctions in the nascent market, while Deepwater Wind has been more successful and currently has the right to develop wind farms in Rhode Island, New York and Connecticut.
Distant_Evaluation	“With this transaction we’re creating the number one offshore wind platform in North America,” Orsted’s offshore wind chief Martin Neubert in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	The drive to open America’s offshore wind industry has attracted Europe’s biggest renewable energy companies, who see the U.S. East Coast as a new frontier after years of success across the Atlantic.
Cause_General	Orsted said the acquisition increased its capital expenditure guidance to 23-25 billion Danish crowns ($3.55-3.86 billion) this year from previous guidance of 16-18 billion.
Cause_General	The new guidance includes the acquisition price of Deepwater Wind, early capex commitments for the U.S. business in the fourth quarter, “as well as increased spending in the remaining portfolio due to timing”.
Cause_General	Orsted also recently acquired U.S. onshore wind developer Lincoln Clean Energy.

Main	QUITO, Dec. 10 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno's state visit to China will strengthen the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries, Chinese Ambassador to Ecuador Wang Yulin said.
Distant_Evaluation	"In a recent interview with Xinhua, Wang held Ecuador as ""a very important partner ... for pragmatic cooperation in the region,"" highlighting the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries."
Main	"The visit, scheduled for Tuesday to Thursday, will actively improve bilateral cooperation to yield ""growth, maturity and shared gains in the process of cooperation,"" Wang told Xinhua in a recent interview."
Cause_General	The trip will mark Moreno's first visit to China since he took office on May 24, 2017.
Distant_Historical	The two countries raised ties to the level of a comprehensive strategic partnership in November 2016, during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Ecuador, the first by a Chinese head of state to the South American country since the two nations established diplomatic ties in 1980.
Distant_Evaluation	"Wang said he has witnessed numerous ""memorable historic moments"" in bilateral ties in the past three years as ambassador."
Distant_Evaluation	"Pragmatic cooperation between China and Ecuador in diverse areas has a ""broad future,"" said Wang."
Distant_Evaluation	"Bilateral ties ""have quickly progressed,"" especially following Xi's visit, and ""are at a historic peak,"" the ambassador said."
Cause_General	The two countries are stepping up exchange in a range of areas, from trade and economy to politics, science and technology, as well as culture and education, he added.
Distant_Historical	China responded rapidly and effectively when Ecuador was hit by a devastating 7.8-magnitude earthquake that ravaged communities along the country's northern coast on April 16, 2016, leaving 673 people dead and extensive structural damage.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The Chinese government and people felt empathy for the Ecuadorian government and people suffering from the disaster, and offered timely aid,"" said Wang."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Close friendship shortens distances."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Despite being separated by vast oceans, China and Ecuador ""have become good friends with sincerity and mutual trust, and good partners in mutually beneficial cooperation,"" said the ambassador."
Distant_Evaluation	He said the two countries have collaborated closely and supported one another in international and regional affairs.
Distant_Evaluation	"Ecuador ""has not only been a strategic partner in energy (cooperation), a target country for Chinese financing and investment, and a market for infrastructure works, but also a trade partner with great potential in Latin America,"" said Wang."
Cause_General	He noted that China is now Ecuador's second-largest trade partner after the United States, with bilateral exchange amounting to 4.62 billion U.S. dollars during the first 10 months of 2018, which marks a year-on-year increase of 36.6 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	"""More and more Ecuadorian bananas and shrimp are served at Chinese tables, and Ecuadorian roses are well-liked by Chinese consumers,"" said Wang."
Cause_General	Currently, more than 90 Chinese companies are operating in Ecuador in sectors including energy, mining, construction and infrastructure.
Distant_Evaluation	Wang highlighted that many projects involving Chinese companies have become emblems of the strategic bilateral cooperation, leading to tangible benefits for the Ecuadorian people.
Distant_Historical	In January, at the second ministerial meeting of the China-CELAC (Community of Latin American and Caribbean States) Forum held in Santiago, Chile, Ecuador expressed an interest in participating in the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative to boost global trade and infrastructure, the diplomat said.
Distant_Evaluation	"Despite the geographic distance, there is ""great potential and a positive outlook in bilateral cooperation in all fields,"" said Wang."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Those who unite behind same ideals can overcome all physical distance."""
Main	BUENOS AIRES/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Uber’s fastest-growing market in the world is now Argentina, company executives say, attributing the expansion to the nation’s sudden economic unraveling, which has boosted unemployment and sliced the purchasing power of Argentines.
Cause_General	Twenty percent of its drivers in Buenos Aires, the only city where it operates in Argentina, were jobless immediately before joining Uber.
Distant_Evaluation	The economic downturn, “has certainly helped many people find us as an alternative source of income,” Felipe Fernandez Aramburu, who runs Uber business development in Argentina, told Reuters in a recent interview.
Distant_Evaluation	Despite worries about the country’s economy, which shrank 4.2 percent in the second quarter after its central bank hiked rates to ward off a currency crisis, the company says it does not fear that a recession could boost the number of drivers without an equivalent increase in demand.
Distant_Evaluation	“Our growth today is less about economic conditions on the rider side,” said Andrew Macdonald, who runs Uber in Latin America.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Instead, Macdonald expects what he described as a paucity of public transportation options to lift demand in Argentina and said growth was highest in the neighborhoods with the least bus and train service.
Cause_General	But Uber’s Argentine unit still faces a snag: For most rides, the company does not charge its drivers the 25 percent commission it is theoretically owed.
Cause_General	Due to legal and regulatory hurdles, Uber rides in Argentina can only be paid with cash or credit cards issued abroad, which almost no locals have.
Cause_General	When rides are paid in cash, drivers currently have no way to pay Uber its 25 percent commission, leaving many with a growing debt to the company.
Cause_General	Commissions from drivers are Uber’s only source of revenue.
Distant_Evaluation	Uber’s Argentine conundrum of being unable to profit from its fast growth there mirrors a wider problem for the ride hailing service, which has struggled to prove that it can be profitable as it gears up for a planned 2019 initial public offering.
Distant_Evaluation	‘TOO MANY DRIVERS’
Distant_Evaluation	Macdonald played down those concerns, however.

Distant_Evaluation	“It’s not about whether we are making money in the near term,” he said, adding that the company will “eventually” have to charge those commissions.
Distant_Evaluation	Macdonald would not say whether the Argentine market is profitable.
Cause_General	Uber has disclosed that its operations in nearby Brazil - now the company’s second-biggest market worldwide - are profitable.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Once Uber can accept local credit and debit cards, it will be able to recoup what it is owed, the company said.
Distant_Evaluation	Drivers, however, say the current Argentine growth rate may be temporary, tied to the lack of a commission charge.
Distant_Anecdotal	“What’s going on is that there are too many drivers currently and so there’s less work for us,” said Jorge, a 62-year old Uber driver who requested anonymity.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Everyone’s coming to Uber because they don’t charge a commission.”
Cause_Specific	Uber says that in the last three months, it has had 55,000 active drivers and 1 million active users in Buenos Aires.
Cause_Specific	Each day, the company said it adds between 300 and 400 new drivers and 7,000 new users.
Cause_General	There’s also attrition in the mix.
Cause_General	“The average lifespan for a driver in Latin America is about three to four months.
Distant_Evaluation	It means they use Uber as something temporary,” Fernandez Aramburu said.
Distant_Evaluation	Uber’s recruitment success reflects a wider trend within Argentina, where a rising jobless rate has hit full-time jobs with benefits in particular, economists say.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are going through a process that is making labor rights more precarious, and formal employment is dwindling,” said Hernan Letcher, director of the Center for Argentine Economic Policy.
Cause_General	Uber has been operating in Argentina since 2016, when it faced aggressive resistance from taxi drivers and government authorities, including legal disputes that led to the ban on credit card payments that is still in place.
Error	Slideshow (6 Images)
Cause_General	There is no regulatory framework for Uber in Buenos Aires, including no way for the government to collect sales tax on the rides.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Macdonald said the company welcomes favorable regulation and that accepting local credit cards is a priority, which will make more drivers pay their 25 percent commission but could also increase Uber’s business.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s a testament to our investment in Argentina ... that we are able to grow so much even without being able to offer the convenience of all payment options,” Macdonald said.
Main	(Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co’s (CPB.N) board is drawing up a list of CEO candidates, with Chief Operating Officer Luca Mignini emerging as the top internal contender, as the company seeks to fend off a proxy challenge from Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund, Third Point LLC, people familiar with the matter said.
Error	FILE PHOTO: Tins of Campbell's tomato soup are seen on a supermarket shelf in Seattle, Washington, U.S. February 10, 2017.
Error	REUTERS/Chris Helgren/File Photo
Main	Third Point unveiled a slate of nominees on Friday to replace Campbell’s 12-member board, pushing it to more actively explore a sale and criticizing its lack of a succession plan after Chief Executive Denise Morrison left in May.
Cause_General	Morrison’s departure came after several years of weak corporate earnings.
Cause_Specific	Campbell board member Keith McLoughlin, who has served as interim CEO since Morrison’s departure, has said he is not interested in the job on a permanent basis.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That has added to pressure on Campbell to find a leader who will help it execute an ambitious turnaround plan it unveiled last month.
Distant_Evaluation	Despite Morrison’s exit almost four months ago, the board has only recently taken formal steps to look externally for a new CEO, according to the sources.
Distant_Historical	Mignini, 55, joined Campbell five years ago and was promoted in April to be its COO, putting the Italian-educated executive in charge of the U.S. company’s snack and meal businesses, in addition to U.S. sales and global development.
Distant_Historical	Morrison also held the COO position before she took the top job in 2011.
Distant_Evaluation	Investors who met with McLoughlin and Campbell Chief Financial Officer Anthony DiSilvestro in recent days told Reuters that Mignini joined the meetings, in a sign the company was seeking to raise his profile.
Distant_Historical	Mignini did not usually attend such meetings in the past, the investors said.
Distant_Historical	CNBC reported in May, at the time of Morrison’s departure, that Mignini was a likely candidate for the CEO seat.
Distant_Anecdotal	The board is also preparing to interview candidates from outside the company, although nobody external has been contacted yet, according to one of the people familiar with the arrangements.
Distant_Anecdotal	Campbell’s board, which includes three heirs of John Dorrance, the chemist who invented condensed soup and ran the company nearly a century ago, will review a list of external candidates at its next meeting at the end of September, the source added.
Distant_Anecdotal	The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential.
Distant_Evaluation	A Campbell spokesman declined to comment on whether Mignini was the top internal candidate and said the board had been working with executive-search firms to assess both internal and external candidates.
Cause_General	Third Point declined to comment.
Cause_General	Campbell Soup shares were up 0.5 percent at $40.40 in early morning trading on Monday, giving the company a market capitalization of about $12 billion.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Third Point’s board challenge could complicate the CEO selection process, given that shareholders could choose to replace board members who will be making that decision, in a vote that could be scheduled as early as November.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The turmoil could discourage some of the consumer industry’s top executives from applying, the sources said.
Distant_Evaluation	Third Point faces an uphill struggle in any battle for control of Campbell Soup, given that descendants of Dorrance own a combined stake of about 42 percent in the company.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A board challenge could ratchet up pressure on Campbell, however, to explore a sale with more urgency.
Distant_Evaluation	EXTERNAL CANDIDATES
Cause_General	Third Point, which manages $18 billion in assets, has played a role in bringing new CEOs to several companies, including Jose Almeida to Baxter International Inc (BAX.N), Tad Smith to Sotheby’s (BID.N), and Marissa Mayer to Yahoo.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	One external CEO candidate Campbell Soup’s board is expected to consider is Mark Clouse, chief executive of Pinnacle Foods Inc PF.N, who will soon be without a full-time job after his company agreed in June to sell itself to ConAgra Brands Inc (CAG.N) for $8.1 billion.
Cause_General	Clouse, 49, is an industry veteran, having also held senior positions at Oreo-maker Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O) and Kraft Foods Inc.
Distant_Evaluation	It is not clear if Clouse would be interested.
Cause_General	He could not be reached for comment.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Campbell said on Aug. 30 it planned to sell its international and fresh refrigerated-foods units, and only left open the possibility of putting the whole company up for sale in the future, snubbing a call from Third Point to do so urgently.
Distant_Evaluation	The 149-year-old company, which revolutionized the home-cooking industry with easy-to-prepare soups and low-cost production techniques, has been struggling to attract young consumers to its namesake soups and Pepperidge Farm cookies.
Distant_Evaluation	Campbell’s latest foray into fresh food has faltered, while Wall Street has questioned an acquisition strategy that increased debt at the same time as costs increased.

Main	TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s core machinery orders rose less than expected in October following an earthquake in the previous month, pointing to more subdued business investment as earnings growth slows and as trade protectionism increases headwinds for the economy.
Error	FILE PHOTO - A worker stands on a crane which is parked at a construction site at Keihin industrial zone in Kawasaki, south of Tokyo, June 13, 2012.

Main	The 7.6 percent rise month-on-month in core machinery orders, considered a leading indicator of capital expenditure, undershot the median estimate for a 10.5 percent gain.
Distant_Historical	That followed a record slide of 18.3 percent in September, when an earthquake struck northern Japan and flooding disrupted business in western parts of the nation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The rebound in machinery orders could be short-lived as the U.S.-China trade war, Japan’s looming trade talks with the United States, and a slowdown in overseas economies are expected to weigh on corporate sentiment.
Cause_General	Underscoring the risks to the outlook, the Cabinet Office lowered its assessment of machinery orders to say there are signs its recovery is stalling.
Distant_Evaluation	Weakening capital expenditure puts Japan’s government in a bind, because policymakers have long predicted that gains in business investment to cope with a shrinking labor force would bolster growth and shield it from risks posed by overseas economies.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Downside risks have increased, because underlying demand is weakening and companies are worried that trade friction will hurt overseas profits,” said Hiroshi Miyazaki, senior economist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.
Distant_Evaluation	“The government has already drawn up extra spending plans, which highlights how worried they are about the economy.”
Cause_General	Earnings growth at Japanese manufacturers is already being crimped by the U.S.-China trade dispute, with several companies downgrading their profit forecasts recently due to cooling demand.
Cause_General	Orders from manufacturers rose 12.3 percent on-month in October after a 17.3 percent decline in September, due to an increase in orders from auto makers and oil refiners, the data showed.
Cause_General	Service-sector orders rose 4.5 percent, following a 17.1 percent decline in the previous month, due to orders from shipping companies and railway operators.
Cause_General	“Core” machinery orders exclude those for ships and from electricity utilities.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Policy makers and investors fear that international trade tensions and slowing global growth could hurt Japan’s export-led economy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Japan’s government will spend about 3 trillion yen ($26.6 billion) in a second extra budget for this fiscal year to boost infrastructure, support farmers and deal with natural disasters, two government sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Bank of Japan’s quarterly tankan business sentiment survey is forecast to show big manufacturers’ confidence worsened for a fourth straight quarter in December due to uncertainties over the global economy and the China-U.S. trade conflict.
Cause_General	The BOJ will release the data on Dec. 14.
Cause_General	Corporate sentiment is closely watched, because companies tend to cut capital expenditure when they grow less confident about the future.
Cause_General	In another warning sign, Japan on Monday revised down gross domestic product in the third quarter to show the largest economic contraction in more than four years, hurt by a steep decline in capital expenditure.
Cause_General	This month in Argentina, U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed a truce that delayed the U.S. increase of tariffs on Chinese goods.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, there are concerns this truce will not hold after Canada’s arrest of Chinese tech company Huawei’s chief financial officer for extradition to the United States.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	U.S. automakers and labor unions have also indicated they want to cap the yen’s weakness and limit the number of Japanese auto imports in trade talks with Tokyo expected next year, which could also put a dampener on business investment.

Main	(Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc (DVMT.N) is exploring an initial public offering (IPO) after shelving this option earlier this year in favor of going public by buying back a special type of stock from investors, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday.
Error	Dell logos are seen at its headquarters in Cyberjaya, outside Kuala Lumpur in this September 4, 2013 file photo.

Cause_Specific	Dell’s IPO deliberations come as several hedge funds, including Elliott Management Corp and Canyon Capital Advisors LLC, as well as activist investor Carl Icahn, resist a $21.7 billion cash-and-stock offer from Dell to buy back “tracking stock” from them tied to Dell’s 81 percent stake in software company VMware Inc (VMW.N).
Cause_General	Such a security “tracks,” or depends, on the financial performance of a specific business unit or operating division of a company, rather than the operations of the issuer as a whole.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The acquisition of this publicly traded tracking stock would result in Dell going public without an IPO.
Distant_Evaluation	However, the hedge funds have said that Dell’s offer shortchanges them because it inflates its own value and discounts the value of the tracking stock.
Distant_Historical	Dell had considered an IPO earlier this year as part of a strategic review that also explored a possibility of a reverse merger with VMware.
Distant_Evaluation	In July, it decided against the IPO because of concerns that its large debt pile would put off stock market investors, sources said at the time.
Cause_General	The tracking stock deal would not require Dell to raise new money because it would be funded by the company issuing new shares and with a $9 billion dividend it would receive from VMware.
Cause_General	Dell’s recent financial performance has emboldened the Round Rock, Texas-based computer company to once again consider the IPO seriously, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deliberations are confidential.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Dell is preparing to interview investment banks this week for underwriting roles in a potential IPO, the sources said.
Cause_General	It has also pushed back a roadshow with tracking stock investors that was slated for this week to the following week, the sources added.
Cause_General	Dell declined to comment.
Cause_General	Dell’s IPO preparations were first reported earlier on Sunday by the Wall Street Journal.
Distant_Evaluation	There is no certainty that Dell will go ahead with an IPO.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Dell Chief Financial Officer Tom Sweet said last week the company would go back to its “status quo” if investors rejected its offer for the tracking stock.
Cause_General	Dell said this month that its operational cash flow soared by 45 percent year-on-year in the latest quarter to $2.6 billion, while its total debt dropped to $50.3 billion, down from the $57.3 billion debt pile in September 2016, when it completed its acquisition of data storage company EMC Corp.
Distant_Evaluation	VALUE OF TRACKING STOCK
Distant_Historical	Dell issued the tracking stock in 2016 to buy EMC for $67 billion because it could not pay for the whole deal in cash and did not want to add to its debt burden.
Distant_Historical	EMC owned the majority stake in VMware, which Dell inherited.
Cause_General	Dell has offered to exchange each tracking share for 1.3665 shares of its Class C common stock, as well as cash, valuing the tracking stock at $109.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Dell’s equity would be valued at between $61.1 billion and $70.1 billion, more than twice the value of the $24.9 billion deal that founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell and buyout firm Silver Lake clinched to take the company private in 2013.
Cause_General	But as with that take-private deal, which went through after Michael Dell slightly changed its terms, hedge funds are opposing the tracking stock offer.
Distant_Evaluation	The tracking stock ended trading on Friday at $96.20, substantially below Dell’s $109 per share offer, indicating investor skepticism over its success.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	After a potential IPO, Dell could force owners of tracking stock to sell it.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The premium would be between 20 and 10 percent, depending on the amount of time between Dell forcing them to sell it and the completion of the IPO, according to regulatory filings.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Whether tracking stock shareholders would be better off under that scenario, as opposed to selling to Dell now, would hinge on the performance of the IPO and the timing of a subsequent takeout.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Going public would give Michael Dell and Silver Lake the option to eventually sell down their stakes, even though they have said they have no plans to do so.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If the tracking stock deal goes through, Michael Dell would own 47 percent to 54 percent of the combined company, while Silver Lake would own between 16 percent and 18 percent.
Cause_General	Michael Dell has turned to deal-making to transform his company from a PC manufacturer into a broader seller of information technology services to businesses, ranging from storage and servers to networking and cyber security.
Distant_Evaluation	The strategy is in sharp contrast to that of rival HP Inc (HPQ.N), which separated in 2016 from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (HPE.N), based on the reasoning that two technology companies focused separately on hardware and services would be more nimble.

Main	BEIJING, Dec. 24 (Xinhua) -- China will lower or remove import and export duties on a number of items starting 2019 as part of a tariff adjustment package announced Monday as the country further opens up the economy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	To expand imports, more than 700 items of products will be subjected to temporary import tariff rates starting Jan. 1, with the duties on the raw materials for some medicines removed, the Ministry of Finance said in an online statement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Tariffs on some fur imports will be reduced while relatively low temporary import tariff rates will continue to be imposed on much-needed advanced equipment such as aircraft engines as well as resource products such as natural feeds, the ministry said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Export tariffs on products including chemical fertilizers and iron ore will be scrapped, it said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	China will also apply conventional tariffs on products from 23 countries and regions, including further reduction in tariffs under free trade pacts between China and relevant countries, the ministry said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This will result in lower tariffs with trade partners including New Zealand, Peru, Costa Rica, among others.
Cause_Specific	The move aims to support the Belt and Road Initiative and the development of free trade areas, speed up China's economic and trade cooperation with relevant countries, and create a favorable external condition for the healthy and stable development of the economy in the long term, the ministry said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Imported goods from China's Hong Kong and Macao into the Chinese mainland will enjoy zero tariffs under relevant pacts on goods trade.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The preferential tariff rates with Bangladesh and Laos under the Asia-Pacific Trade Agreement will be adjusted along with a reduction in the most-favored-nation (MFN) tariff rates.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	China will also reduce the MFN rates for 298 items of information technology products from July 1, 2019, the ministry said.
Distant_Historical	In a bid to open its economy wider to the world, China lowered tariffs on an array of products from medicines to vehicles in 2018, with the general duty level down from 9.8 percent to 7.5 percent.

Cause_General	"BEIJING, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Xi Jinping's signed article titled ""Joining Hands for New Splendor in the New Era"" published Tuesday on Spanish newspaper ABC ahead of his visit has drawn warm responses in the European country, raising high expectations for more vigorous development of the China-Spain relations."
Distant_Evaluation	Spanish media and scholars hail the visit as a new historic development opportunity, and believe that the Chinese president has charted the course in his signed article for development of the two countries' relations.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""China sees in Spain a good partner along the course of development, and China hopes to bring out the best the two economies could offer each other and make good use of existing cooperation mechanisms,"" Xi said in the article."
Distant_Evaluation	"""We need to synergize the Belt and Road Initiative and Spain's 'Strategic Vision for Spain in Asia' and the 'Mediterranean Corridor', and actively explore cooperation in third markets for win-win cooperation in broader areas,"" he said."
Cause_General	Spain's most read newspaper El Pais wrote that during the first state visit to Spain by a Chinese president in 13 years, the two countries seek for closer bilateral ties in various fields such as politics, economy and culture.
Main	The upcoming signing of a series of bilateral economic and trade agreements will boost exports of Spain's agricultural products into the Chinese market, and create favorable conditions for the two countries to explore cooperation in third markets, said El Pais.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Belt and Road Initiative provides plenty of opportunities for cooperation between the Chinese and Spanish companies, and the Chinese president's visit will drive more Spanish products like grapes and pork products into the Chinese market, Spanish Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism Reyes Maroto was quoted as saying by Expansion, a key economic newspaper in Spain.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	ABC also published articles regarding Xi's visit, saying that President Xi's visit to Spain will open up a new page for bilateral relations and the enhancement of mutual understanding, and the Belt and Road Initiative has rejuvenated the ancient commercial road, from which Spain should not detach itself.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Spanish newspaper El Confidencial expects that President Xi's visit could yield more concrete fruits in bilateral cooperation, so that the Spanish public could feel the positive influences brought by the results.
Distant_Evaluation	Alberto Rubio, director of Spanish newspaper The Diplomat, said that undoubtedly China is a partner of great significance for Spain, adding that there is huge potential for bilateral cooperation, and there are still many fields to explore in this relationship.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Xi also said in the article that a major task of the trip this time ""is to engage with leaders of host countries and major economies in discussions on ways to enhance unity among the international community, improve global governance, develop partnerships, and deepen friendship and cooperation for peace, stability, development and prosperity of the world."""
Distant_Evaluation	Xulio Rios, director of Spain's Observatory of Chinese Politics, said Xi's article is of huge realistic significance and noble ambitions.
Distant_Evaluation	"Xi quoted Spanish philosopher Jose Ortega Gasset in his article as saying that ""one can only make progress when he thinks big, and move forward when he looks far."""
Distant_Evaluation	Rios said Xi's quotes aim to remind us that the China-Spain relationship not only has a long history, but also boasts huge potentials for healthy development, and that both countries should seize the valuable opportunity to deepen bilateral ties.
Distant_Evaluation	Jose Luis Barcelo, director of Spanish online newspaper El Mundo Financiero, said the world looks forward to knowing more about China and Xi's trip has offered more opportunities for China to establish political, commercial and cultural relations with the rest of the world, and has opened a window of hope to create a multipolar world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

Main	TOKYO, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Tokyo stocks closed sharply lower Friday, with the benchmark Nikkei stock index dropping over 2 percent, as investors offloaded issues following an overnight rout on Wall Street, triggered by concerns over the outlook for the global economy.
Cause_Specific	The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average dropped 452.81 points, or 2.26 percent, from last Friday to close the day at 19,561.96.
Cause_Specific	The broader Topix index of all First Section issues on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, meanwhile, lost 22.93 points, or 1.53 percent, to finish at 1,471.16.

Main	BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) - Volvo Cars and its Chinese owner Geely have postponed plans to float shares in the Swedish carmaker, blaming trade tensions and a downturn in automotive stocks.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But while Volvo’s plans for a Stockholm listing were delayed indefinitely, Britain’s Aston Martin vowed to push ahead with its own initial public offering.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’ve come to the conclusion that the timing is not optimal for an IPO right now,” Volvo Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters by telephone on Monday, confirming a decision which was first reported by the Financial Times.
Cause_Specific	Volvo and its Chinese parent had been discussing an IPO to value the carmaker at between $16 billion and $30 billion, sources have previously said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The company said a listing was still possible in the future.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But Samuelsson said IPO prospects had dimmed with the business cycle, amid a broad-based decline in automotive shares that has dragged the Stoxx 600 Autos & Parts index .SXAP 15 percent lower so far this year.
Distant_Evaluation	Even before the recent sell-off, however, some observers doubted the $30 billion upper end of Volvo’s target valuation.
Distant_Evaluation	“We had expressed our reservations concerning lofty valuation ambitions before,” Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said on Monday.
Distant_Evaluation	“Trade wars are just one red flag.”
Cause_General	Washington’s escalating trade spat with Beijing and tensions with Europe have rattled automotive investors, adding volatility to market outlooks.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Volvo is less exposed than its German premium rivals to U.S.-China tariffs, however, and has said it will juggle production of its XC60 SUV to reduce their impact.
Cause_General	It delivered 61,480 cars in China in the first half, a fraction of BMW’s (BMWG.DE) or Audi’s (VOWG_p.DE) sales.
Cause_General	Geely, which paid Ford Motor Co (F.N) $1.8 billion for Volvo in 2010, also has stakes in Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler (DAIGn.DE), truckmaker AB Volvo (VOLVb.ST) and Lotus.
Distant_Evaluation	CHINESE INROADS
Distant_Anecdotal	Geely and its boss Li Shufu had concluded that Volvo should make deeper inroads into the Chinese market before listing, a person familiar with the group’s thinking told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	And Volvo, which is developing Polestar as an electrified performance brand and owns a stake in Geely stablemate Lynk&Co, has “other alternatives” to raise finance, Samuelsson said.
Distant_Evaluation	The IPO postponement reflects bigger concerns about “price development after a potential IPO” rather than about the initial valuation, the CEO added, citing sensitivities over the prevalence of public pension funds among Swedish investors.
Distant_Evaluation	“What made me nervous especially was leaving headroom for investors” amid growing market uncertainties, he said.
Distant_Historical	Swedish telecoms operator Telia (TELIA.ST) drew public wrath after its shares sank from their 2000 debut.
Distant_Evaluation	For a domestic car brand, such a setback could dent both image and sales.
Distant_Evaluation	Samuelsson also said that Aston Martin, as a pure luxury play, was “more like Ferrari” - whose widely envied listing came close to late boss Sergio Marchionne’s 10-billion-euro target valuation.
Distant_Historical	Like Volvo, Aston Martin was once owned by Ford.
Distant_Evaluation	“I wish them luck with their IPO,” Samuelsson said.

Main	SINGAPORE, Dec. 24 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's Consumer Price Index (CPI) grew 0.3 percent year on year in November, following the 0.7 percent increase in October, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in a joint release on Monday.
Cause_General	The MAS Core Inflation, which excludes the costs of accommodation and private road transport, declined from 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in October to 1.7 percent in November.
Cause_Specific	The authorities said the CPI decline was largely due to a sharper fall in private road transport costs, and to a lesser extent, smaller increases in the prices of services, retail items and electricity and gas, which more than offset a slower pace of decline in accommodation costs.
Cause_General	As for the MAS Core Inflation, they attributed the decline to a smaller increases in the costs of services, retail items and electricity and gas.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The MTI and MAS reiterated their forecasts, saying the city-state will see the MAS Core Inflation rise modestly in the months ahead, and come in within the forecast range of 1.5-2 percent in 2018 and 1.5-2.5 percent in 2019.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The CPI is projected to grow by about 0.5 percent in 2018, before rising to 1-2 percent in 2019, they added.
Main	A public pension fund in Louisiana has sued the directors of Caremark Rx, contending that their unanimous backing of the company's $21 billion merger with CVS over a rival $26 billion bid from Express Scripts improperly benefits Caremark executives at the expense of shareholders.
Cause_Specific	Among the benefits Caremark executives and directors will receive if the CVS deal goes through, the fund's lawsuit contends, are positions at the combined company and indemnification from penalties and fines that may result when criminal and regulatory investigations into possible stock option backdating by Caremark officials are concluded.
Cause_General	Yesterday, Express Scripts filed suit to block the CVS deal, arguing that the terms deal supported by the Caremark board prevents its directors from executing their fiduciary duties to shareholders.
Main_Consequence	The lawsuits, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, will once again bring the fiduciary duties of directors in the post-Enron world to the forefront.
Cause_General	Delaware is where most major United States companies are incorporated.
Distant_Historical	Caremark accepted the CVS bid on Nov. 1, even though the stock-for-stock deal offered no premium to Caremark's market price at the time.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Caremark's directors have recommended that company shareholders approve the deal at a meeting that is expected to occur before March 16.
Distant_Evaluation	On Monday, Caremark rejected the $26 billion bid made on Dec. 18 by Express Scripts, saying that it would ''result in a highly leveraged and weakened business'' if it was approved by shareholders.
Cause_General	The Express Scripts offer of $58.50 a share is approximately 15 percent higher than the CVS bid.
Cause_Specific	The lawsuit filed by the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System contends that the CVS deal is unfair to Caremark shareholders not only because its price is significantly below the rival bid.
Cause_Specific	The pension fund's lawyers also argue that Caremark directors improperly accepted deal protection provisions in the CVS bid that act to deter other bidders, effectively making the deal a fait accompli even before the shareholders vote.
Cause_Specific	First, there is the $675 million breakup fee to be paid by Caremark in cash to CVS, if the target walks away.
Cause_Specific	Then, there is a so-called last-look provision, which gives CVS the chance to come back and top any rival bid.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''Any potential third-party bidders will be loath to invest the time and resources necessary to pursue a superior bid while knowing full well that CVS retains control of the bidding,'' the pension fund's lawsuit says.
Distant_Evaluation	The Louisiana fund accuses the Caremark board of supporting the deal to benefit Edwin M. Crawford, the company's chief executive, and other executives.
Cause_Specific	Under the terms of the deal, nine Caremark executives will join the combined company and Mr. Crawford will become chairman of its board and receive an estimated $48 million in exit pay.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While he would probably receive a similar amount if Caremark sold out to Express Scripts, Mr. Crawford might not be asked to join the combined company under the terms of such a deal.
Cause_General	The Louisiana pension fund also noted that the CVS deal guarantees a job at the merged company for Mr. Crawford's son, Andrew.
Distant_Historical	A Caremark proxy filed last year described the younger Mr. Crawford as senior vice president for industry analysis and underwriting.
Cause_Specific	The merger with CVS would also allow an unspecified number of Caremark directors -- perhaps all of them -- to get lucrative seats on the combined company's board.
Cause_Specific	In its offer, CVS has also agreed to cover any costs associated with stock option backdating at Caremark, practices that are under federal investigation and the subject of another civil suit filed against the company in Tennessee.
Cause_General	That lawsuit has challenged 4.6 million options granted to Mr. Crawford as having been possibly backdated.
Cause_General	Stock sales covered by those options generated $262 million for Mr. Crawford, the Tennessee lawsuit contends.
Distant_Evaluation	''The inequities could not be more apparent,'' said Gerald H. Silk, a lawyer at Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger & Grossmann, one of the firms representing the Louisiana fund.
Distant_Evaluation	''Shareholders get a coercive, zero-premium deal while Crawford gets a $48 million payout, jobs for himself and his son and complete indemnification for his alleged option backdating transgressions.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A Caremark spokesman called the pension fund's lawsuit meritless and said the company would defend against it vigorously.
Distant_Evaluation	As for the Express Scripts suit, he said it was a ''frivolous'' attempt to interfere with the CVS merger.
Distant_Evaluation	''Contrary to allegations made by Express Scripts, the provisions of the CVS merger agreement are lawful and appropriate,'' the spokesman said.
Distant_Evaluation	To be sure, many of the terms in the CVS bid for Caremark -- the no-shop provisions and last-look opportunity -- are common in the merger world.
Cause_General	But the suit filed in Delaware, comes at a time when directors' actions as fiduciaries for their shareholders are under increased scrutiny.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As a result, the case, which is being heard by Chancellor William B. Chandler III, provides an opportunity for him to opine on the matter of directors' duties broadly and whether the Caremark directors exercised those obligations in particular.
Distant_Evaluation	This is familiar territory for Chancellor Chandler, who oversaw the Disney case of 2005.
Distant_Historical	In that case he chastised the company's directors for essentially rubberstamping a contract struck by Michael D. Eisner with Michael S. Ovitz that resulted in a $140 million severance payout after Mr. Ovitz was terminated a short time later.
Cause_General	Chancellor Chandler has asked for a hearing on the issues before Caremark's shareholders vote on the CVS bid, now scheduled to take place in mid-March.
Distant_Evaluation	In a Dec. 29 meeting with the parties in the case, Chancellor Chandler said that while he was certain Caremark would argue forcefully that its directors exercised their duties of care and loyalty to the company's owners, he also concluded that ''there is a tenable argument on the other side, and nonfrivolous claims here on the other side, that at least need to be tested against a fuller record.''
Cause_Specific	Correction: January 12, 2007, Friday An article in Business Day yesterday about a lawsuit filed by a pension fund over the proposed merger between Caremark RX and CVS misstated the amount of exit pay that Caremark's chief executive, Edwin M. Crawford, would receive if a rival bid was accepted.
Cause_Specific	If Express Scripts succeeds in its rival bid, Mr. Crawford would receive $57.6 million to $62.4 million, not an estimated $48 million.

Main	CHICAGO, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) agricultural futures closed sharply higher in the first week of 2019, boosted by dry weather impacting Brazilian crops and news about upcoming trade talks between China and the United States.
Cause_Specific	For the trading week which ended Jan. 4, the most active corn contract for March delivery was up 7.5 cents weekly, or 2 percent, to 3.83 dollars per bushel.
Cause_Specific	March wheat rose 5.2 cents, or 1.08 percent, to 5.17 dollars per bushel.
Cause_Specific	March soybeans rallied 26 cents, or 2.9 percent, to 9.215 dollars per bushel.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At the end of 2018, Chinese and U.S. heads of state stressed during a telephone conversation the latest progress in trade talks, voicing hope for further results that can bring benefits to both sides and the world.
Cause_Specific	Entering new year, CBOT agricultural futures, soybeans in particular, were further uplifted by official confirmation that China and the United States would hold vice ministerial level trade consultations on January 7 and 8 in Beijing.
Cause_General	China has been the world's top soybean buyer.
Distant_Evaluation	Any positive development concerning the trade talks between the two sides will naturally boost U.S. soybean prices.
Cause_Specific	Adverse weather conditions in South America have also supported CBOT futures, especially soybean and corn prices, as dryness is expected to hit more than a third of Brazil's crop areas this month.
Cause_General	Brazil is another leading soybean grower in the world.
Cause_Specific	As a result of the weather factor, combined with China trade hopes, the U.S. soybean futures posted nearly 3 percent gains this week.
Cause_General	However, a partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government has made it difficult for CBOT traders to follow official export data, as the Department of Agriculture (USDA) has not updated its export sales reports since Dec. 21, 2018.
Cause_General	Traders now have to learn from other channels about new overseas purchases of U.S. soybeans and other agricultural commodities.
Cause_Specific	CBOT wheat, which recorded a 18 percent annul rise in 2018, started the new year further higher, in step with a rally in European market.
Cause_General	World wheat prices have increased amid concerns over declining Argentine grain quality and tightening supplies from Russia and Black Sea area.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Following recently reported export sales to Egypt, U.S. wheat might be in a position to take larger market share, with the help of a softer dollar, said analysts.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Along with likely shrinking U.S. winter wheat seeding acres, AgResource, a Chicago-based Agricultural research firm, now maintains a bullish outlook into spring with an initial target of 5.50 dollars per bushel for March delivery.
Distant_Evaluation	Meanwhile, the corn market's upside potential is also in focus, said AgResource, given the unfavorable weather conditions in South America.

Main	BERLIN, Nov. 29 (Xinhua) -- German investigators have raided the offices of Deutsche Bank on Thursday as part of a probe into potential money-laundering activities by the Frankfurt-based lender.
Main	Around 170 state prosecution officers, federal criminal police officers and tax investigation officers participated in the searches at six premises associated with Deutsche Bank in and around Frankfurt.
Cause_Specific	"A spokesperson for the local state prosecution office confirmed that the raid was prompted by suspected money laundering offenses which were identified in the wake of the so-called ""Offshore-Leaks"" and ""Panama Papers"" scandals."
Cause_General	"Two Deutsche Bank employees, as well as ""other not yet identified culprits"" are believed to have assisted customers in establishing shell corporations in tax havens and subsequently transferring funds derived through crime onto German accounts of the bank."
Cause_General	An entity associated with DAX-listed institute in the British Virgin Islands is believed to have assisted more than 900 customers in such transactions with a volume of 311 million euros (353 million U.S. dollars) since 2016 alone.
Cause_General	The offshore activity in question was not flagged to government authorities as being suspicious.
Cause_General	As a consequence, the suspects are accused by prosecutors of having neglected their fiduciary duty to report on potential money laundering offenses although there was sufficient evidence to suggest criminal behavior on behalf of clients.
Distant_Historical	Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest financial institute, has posted heavy losses during past years as a spat of legal scandals and falling investment banking revenue weighed on its earnings.
Distant_Evaluation	"During the recent presentation of third quarter (Q3) figures, chief executive officer (CEO) Christian Sewing expressed confidence that ongoing corporate reforms were finally beginning to bear fruit as a ""new discipline"" in the bank took hold."
Main	"Responding to the raids on Thursday, Deutsche Bank released a statement in which it confirmed that the police was currently investigating ""several"" of its German locations with regards to the Panama Papers."

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"We will cooperate with the authorities fully"", a statement by the bank read."
Main	Rockville, MD (Reuters) - Instagram on Monday said co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger have resigned as chief executive officer and chief technical officer of the photo-sharing app owned by Facebook Inc, giving scant explanation for the move.
Cause_General	The departures at Facebook’s fastest-growing revenue generator come just months after the exit of Jan Koum, co-founder of Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp, leaving the social network without the developers behind two of its biggest services.
Cause_General	They also come at a time when Facebook’s core platform is under fire for how it safeguards customer data, as it defends against political efforts to spread false information, and as younger users increasingly prefer alternative ways to stay in touch with family and friends.
Cause_General	Concerns over Facebook’s business sparked the biggest one-day wipeout in U.S. stock market history in July.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Systrom wrote in a blog post on Monday that he and Krieger planned to take time off and explore “our curiosity and creativity again”.
Cause_General	Their announcement came after increasingly frequent clashes with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg over the direction of Instagram, Bloomberg reported.
Distant_Evaluation	In a statement, Zuckerberg described the two as “extraordinary product leaders”.
Distant_Evaluation	“I’ve learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have really enjoyed it.
Distant_Evaluation	I wish them all the best and I’m looking forward to seeing what they build next,” Zuckerberg said.
Cause_General	INDEPENDENCE
Cause_General	Koum’s departure in May followed the exit of his WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton.
Cause_General	That led to a reshuffling of Facebook’s executive ranks, increasing Zuckerberg’s ability to influence day-to-day operations.
Cause_General	Zuckerberg ally Chris Cox, who leads product development for Facebook’s main app, gained oversight of WhatsApp and Instagram, which had been given independence when Facebook bought them.

Cause_General	Adam Mosseri, who had overseen Facebook’s news feed and spent a decade working closely with Zuckerberg, became Instagram’s head of product.
Cause_General	Instagram and Facebook have operated independently and the two services barely mention each other.
Cause_General	But as regulators have pushed Facebook to improve information safeguards for individual privacy, to combat addiction to social media, and to stop misinformation or fake news, Zuckerberg and other leaders have been under more pressure to monitor units beyond the core social network.
Distant_Evaluation	ACQUISITION DONE RIGHT
Main	Systrom and Krieger notified the photo-sharing app’s leadership team and Facebook on Monday about their decision to leave, Instagram said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Their departure would be soon, it said.
Cause_General	The New York Times first reported the move.
Distant_Historical	Systrom and Krieger met through Stanford University and worked separately in Silicon Valley before forming Instagram in 2010.
Distant_Historical	Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion.
Cause_General	The photo-sharing app has over 1 billion active monthly users and has grown by adding features such as messaging and short videos.
Distant_Historical	In 2016, it added the ability to post slideshows that disappear in 24 hours, mimicking the “stories” feature of Snap Inc’s Snapchat.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The photo app’s global revenue this year is likely to exceed $8 billion, showed data from advertising consultancy EMarketer.
Cause_General	Increased advertising on Instagram has seen the average price-per-ad across Facebook’s apps decline this year after a year of upswing.
Cause_General	A new privacy law in Europe also has affected prices.
Distant_Evaluation	Instagram had been hailed in Silicon Valley as a flashy acquisition done right, with the team kept relatively small and Systrom having the freedom to add features such as peer-to-peer messaging, video uploads and advertising.
Distant_Historical	“I see Mark [Zuckerberg] practice a tremendous amount of restraint in giving us the freedom to run, but the reason why I think he gives us the freedom to run is because when we run, it typically works,” Systrom told Recode last June.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Marketo’s business-to-business marketing applications will complement Adobe’s digital marketing business, which provides cloud-based tools to help create, manage and analyze advertising and marketing campaigns, the companies said.
Distant_Historical	Marketo, started in 2006 as an email marketing service, was taken private by Vista for $1.8 billion in 2016.
Distant_Historical	The San Mateo, California-based company generated revenue of about $321 million in 2017, according to credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service Inc.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of Adobe’s fiscal 2018 and Marketo Chief Executive Officer Steve Lucas will join the company’s senior leadership team and continue to lead the Marketo team, Adobe said.
Distant_Historical	After Vista acquired Marketo, it changed its management team, adding Lucas, a former SAP SE executive, as the CEO in 2016, who helped revive sales growth at the company.

Cause_General	Thwake dam, a strategic water supply project for the large semi-arid area of Makueni County and surrounding regions, comprises a multi-purpose dam for water supply, hydropower generation and irrigation development.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It will also provide regulation of flows on Athi River downstream of the dam for flood and drought mitigation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	AfDB said the completion of the 80.5m high multi-purpose dam will enable the storage of 681 million cubic meters of water, of which 625 million cubic meters will be used for electricity production and downstream irrigation of agricultural land; 22 million cubic meters for upstream irrigation and 34 million for human use.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Construction in the initial phase of the TMWDP project should be completed in December 2022, the lender said.
Main	NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - China set a 10 percent tariff on U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, extending a trade dispute into energy and casting a shadow over U.S. export terminals that would propel the United States into the world’s second-largest LNG seller.

Cause_General	Beijing on Tuesday said it would tax U.S. products worth $60 billion effective Sept. 24 in retaliation for tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump in an escalating trade war.
Distant_Evaluation	The rate was smaller than the 25 percent tariff China had touted earlier, which offered some relief and helped shares in listed U.S. LNG companies climb.
Distant_Evaluation	The tariffs undermine Trump’s drive to use U.S. shale oil and natural gas to turn the United States into a global energy leader.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The U.S. is on track to export over 1,000 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas as LNG in 2018.
Cause_General	One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But China, which purchased about 15 percent of all U.S. LNG shipped in 2017, is now on track to buy less than 100 bcf of U.S. LNG in 2018, less than last year, according to Thomson Reuters vessel tracking and U.S. Department of Energy data.
Cause_General	The country has taken delivery from just four vessels since June versus 17 during the first five months of the year.
Error	[For a graphic on U.S. LNG deliveries to China, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2n9bQKn]
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Proposed U.S. export terminals, many expected to supply Chinese customers, were expected to account for 60 percent of all new LNG production coming to market by 2023, according to industry data.
Distant_Evaluation	LNG, which involves super-cooling natural gas so it can be transported by ship rather than pipeline, has become one of the fastest growing commodity trades as nations seek cleaner fuels.
Distant_Evaluation	The tariff’s extension to an energy commodity much in demand in China was a worrisome sign for trade relations and for billions of dollars in proposed U.S. terminals, said trade group executives.
Distant_Evaluation	Including LNG “is a good indicator of how serious things have gotten between the U.S. and China on this trade issue,” said Charlie Riedl, executive director of Center for Liquefied Natural Gas, a group whose members include Cheniere Energy, Chevron and Exxon Mobil.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“While we would like to see this resolved quickly, I don’t see that happening right now,” said Riedl, speaking by phone from a natural gas conference in Spain.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The longer the dispute lasts, the less likely proposed projects will find financial backers, he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Analysts say the tariffs will particularly hit plans by U.S. companies, such as Cheniere Energy (LNG.A), Sempra (SRE.N) and Kinder Morgan (KMI.N), to build new terminals or expand existing ones by adding processing units.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Some commercial agreements may be on hold until there is more visibility,” said Stacey Morris, director of energy research at Alerian Indexes.
Cause_General	Cheniere, Kinder Morgan and Dominion Energy declined to comment.
Cause_General	But the smaller-than-expected Chinese tariff helped lift Cheniere Energy, whose shares on Tuesday were up 2.9 percent, and Golar LNG (GLNG.O), whose stock rose 2 percent.
Cause_General	China imported 1.6 million tonnes, or 11 percent, of the 14.9 million tonnes of LNG exported from the United States so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Cause_General	That accounted for 5 percent of total Chinese LNG imports.
Cause_General	The U.S. has been looking to Europe to take on more of its natural gas as the China dispute continues.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Germany said on Tuesday the country would decide by year-end where to locate a new LNG receiving terminal as a gesture to the Trump administration.
Main	PARIS (Reuters) - French bank Natixis (CNAT.PA) said on Wednesday it planned to sell several specialized finance businesses to its parent, unlisted French cooperative lender BPCE, and use part of the 2.7 billion euros ($3.1 billion) in proceeds for acquisitions.
Error	FILE PHOTO: The logo of French bank Natixis is seen outside one of their offices in Paris February 18, 2013.
Error	REUTERS/Charles Platiau/File Photo
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“This planned transaction would give Natixis further financial firepower to invest in its differentiating asset-light business lines – primarily asset management,” Chief Executive Francois Riahi said in a statement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Natixis said the deal would leave it with a war chest of 2.5 billion euros for acquisitions over the 2018-2020 period, up from 1 billion euros previously earmarked, although it currently has no specific new deals in the works.
Distant_Historical	The bank has already spent 400 million euros of that amount on two acquisitions earlier this year, its CEO said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The French investment bank said it intends to pay shareholders a special dividend of 1.5 billion euros after the deal is closed during the first quarter next year if it doesn’t find acquisition opportunities.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Natixis said the sale of assets will allow BPCE to widen the range of services it offers to its retail customers, while Natixis will beef up its profile as an investment bank.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Natixis will narrow its focus to asset management, wealth management, investment banking, payment services and insurance.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It intends to make acquisitions in all those businesses, except for insurance.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If Natixis were to identify acquisition targets after the special dividend is paid to shareholders, BPCE would back it with capital if needed, BPCE’s Chief Executive Laurent Mignon said in a conference call with journalists.
Cause_General	Mignon, Natixis’ CEO until June, is also chairman of the investment bank’s supervisory board.
Cause_General	The assets to be sold to BPCE are consumer financing, factoring, leasing, sureties and guarantees, and securities services businesses.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Following the transaction, Natixis expects to raise its target for return on tangible equity in 2020 to between 14 percent and 15.5 percent from a previous target of between 13 percent and 14.5 percent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The bank will also lift its core equity tier one ratio to 11 percent from 10.5 percent at the end of the second quarter as it will keep 500 million euros in capital.

Main	MANILA, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Tuesday that it has approved a 500-million-U.S. dollar emergency assistance loan to support Indonesia's recovery and rehabilitation of Lombok and Central Sulawesi after recent disasters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Manila-based bank said the loan will provide immediate funding for the government's recovery and rehabilitation action plans, targeting urgent needs such as temporary shelters, social protection and services, as well as economic recovery through cash assistance, credit schemes and skills improvement programs.
Distant_Evaluation	"""ADB's emergency assistance loan provides timely and flexible financing to help mitigate the devastating impacts of the recent disasters,"" said Sona Shrestha, ADB's Director for Public Management, Financial Sector, and Trade Division for Southeast Asia."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""The quick-disbursing loan modality will help ensure that post-disaster recovery and rehabilitation expenditures are met without compromising critical economic and social development expenditures in the national budget,"" she added."
Cause_Specific	The Emergency Assistance for Recovery and Rehabilitation from Recent Disasters is part of ADB's response to two recent disasters that hit Indonesia including a magnitude-7.0 earthquake that struck Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara province, in August, and a magnitude-7.4 earthquake that struck Central Sulawesi province in September.
Cause_Specific	These disasters claimed the lives of more than 2,600 people, injured some 18,000 people and displaced more than half a million, according to the ADB.
Distant_Evaluation	The ADB said housing and public infrastructure have suffered extensive damage, adding that the impact of the Central Sulawesi disaster has been particularly severe as the earthquake caused landslides, tsunami, and liquefaction, a condition where the ground itself loses stability and takes on liquid properties.
Cause_Specific	According to the ADB, the initial assessments suggest over 2.2 billion U.S. dollars in damage and losses in the affected provinces.
Cause_General	In October, the bank approved an emergency grant of 3 million U.S. dollars from the Asia Pacific Disaster Respond Fund for immediate relief in Central Sulawesi.
Cause_General	In addition, it is also supporting the Indonesian government with technical assistance in post-disaster needs assessments and reconstruction planning.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The ADB said it is preparing new technical assistance to build capacity for robust monitoring, evaluation, and financial reporting of the rehabilitation and reconstruction plans.
Distant_Evaluation	Hedge funds have been very good to institutions like Yale.
Distant_Historical	On its 2005 tax forms, the university reported annual income of $149 million from its hedge fund investments.
Distant_Historical	And much of that income, which would have been taxable if derived from domestic hedge funds, was tax free because it was generated by offshore affiliates of such funds.
Cause_Specific	That strategy of tax avoidance is one that many of the nation's wealthiest universities, as well as foundations and pension funds, have been using with great success.
Main	Now Congress is considering closing the loophole that allows it.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The goal is to raise money for the Treasury.
Cause_Specific	The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has been looking into hedge fund practices, estimates that more than $100 billion in tax revenue a year is lost through the use of offshore tax havens and questionable tax shelters by investors of all types.
Distant_Evaluation	''A key concern is whether tax-exempt use of offshore corporations to invest in hedge funds is accelerating the shifting of U.S. assets offshore to avoid U.S. taxes,'' said Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the subcommittee and who is among the sponsors of legislation that would close a number of such loopholes.
Cause_General	While nonprofit institutions are generally exempt from taxation, income produced by business activity that is deemed outside the scope of their mission may be subject to tax.
Cause_General	Under the tax code, profits from any activities financed with borrowed money, like much of the income from hedge fund and private equity investments, are taxable.
Cause_General	But if the nonprofit invests in an offshore company, there is no tax.
Cause_General	So hedge funds and private equity funds have set up offshore subsidiaries for nonprofits and other tax-exempt groups like pension funds to invest in.
Cause_General	For instance, Farallon Capital Institutional Partners L.P. of San Francisco, a hedge fund in which Yale, the University of Michigan and other universities have invested, has a management company in the British Virgin Islands.
Distant_Historical	The offshore company was created in large part to help nonprofits avoid taxes, Thomas F. Steyer, Farallon's senior managing partner, wrote investors in a letter in 2000.
Distant_Historical	A 2005 article in the newsletter Tax Notes said Duke University sought to keep 25 percent of its endowment, which now stands at $7.4 billion, invested in hedge funds.
Distant_Historical	At the time, about 75 percent of Duke's hedge fund investments were in offshore funds, according to the article, written by Maximilian H. Haag, a Duke law student who had interviewed the university's investment managers.
Cause_General	But universities do not generally disclose what portion of their endowment is invested in offshore hedge funds, and so it is impossible to estimate how much tax they are avoiding.
Cause_General	And their officials are wary of discussing the issue.
Cause_General	Spokesmen for 10 of the nation's wealthiest universities either did not respond to a reporter's messages or declined to make anyone from their investment management teams available.
Cause_General	''As a matter of policy, we do not comment on our portfolio,'' Cass Ciatt, a spokeswoman for Princeton, wrote in an e-mail message.
Cause_General	David Jarmul, a spokesman for Duke, emphasized the university's support for research, its financial aid programs and the other benefits its endowment provides.
Distant_Evaluation	The university invests ''in various ways to maximize returns,'' Mr. Jarmul said by e-mail.
Distant_Evaluation	''Like other universities, Duke uses legitimate tax-advantaged structures, always in accordance with applicable law.''
Distant_Evaluation	With growing signs of displeasure from Congress, however, there are indications that some universities are reconsidering the use of offshore entities as a tax-avoidance method.
Distant_Evaluation	''This practice is legal and has been approved by the Internal Revenue Service in a number of rulings,'' said Patrick Dunkley, senior counsel at Stanford University, whose endowment stood at $14.1 billion in 2006.
Distant_Evaluation	''We are nonetheless currently reviewing the investment strategy.''
Distant_Historical	Congress made a pass at closing the loophole in 1993.
Distant_Evaluation	''I can tell you why I proposed it in one word: revenue,'' said former Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee from 1981 to 1994.
Distant_Evaluation	''That's the same thing driving them now.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Rostenkowski said that under ''pay as you go'' budget rules, which Congress adopted anew in January, ''you have to raise the revenue to feed this appetite we have for spending money.''
Distant_Evaluation	In some cases, hedge fund investors can realize returns as high as 40 percent or more.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	So while closing the loophole could mean additional taxes for nonprofits, it would be unlikely to reduce their investments in hedge funds and private equity funds significantly, said Leon M. Metzger, a former hedge fund executive who teaches hedge fund management at New York University.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''Because returns are so very attractive, unless Congress takes an extreme approach, I don't think this will have a major impact,'' Mr. Metzger said.
Distant_Anecdotal	In addition, two hedge fund partners who spoke only on condition of anonymity, for fear of alienating clients, said nonprofits could probably use other investment strategies to avoid taxes.
Cause_General	Foundations also use the loophole, although the nation's largest, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, had no hedge fund investments at the end of last year.
Cause_General	Richard Tofel, the Rockefeller Foundation's general counsel, said 21 percent of its $3.7 billion endowment was invested in hedge funds and 12 percent in private equity funds.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Tofel said he did not know what portion of those investments were offshore, but Rockefeller expects to pay $7 million in income taxes for 2006.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He also said Rockefeller would be unlikely to end all its offshore investments if the law changed.
Distant_Evaluation	''Tax is part of what goes into the mix in making investment decisions,'' Mr. Tofel said, ''but on the other hand it's not the principal thing that drives investment decisions.
Distant_Evaluation	You make judgments about underlying asset values, risk and reward, and taxes come in somewhere after that.''

Main	BEIJING, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- China published a white paper on Monday to clarify the facts about China-U.S. economic and trade relations, demonstrate its stance on trade friction with the United States, and pursue reasonable solutions.
Main	Excluding the foreword, the 36,000-Chinese-character white paper is comprised of six parts, which are mutually-beneficial and win-win China-U.S. cooperation in the trade and economic field, clarification of the facts about China-U.S. trade and economic relations, the trade protectionist practices of the U.S. administration, the trade bullyism practices of the U.S. administration, damage of the improper practices of the U.S. administration to global economy, and China's position.
Cause_General	China is the world's biggest developing country and the United States is the biggest developed country, said the white paper.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Trade and economic relations between China and the United States are of great significance for the two countries as well as for the stability and development of the world economy."""
Distant_Evaluation	The white paper said the two countries are at different stages of development and have different economic systems, and therefore some level of trade friction is only natural.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The key, however, lies in how to enhance mutual trust, promote cooperation, and manage differences."""
Cause_Specific	In the spirit of equality, rationality, and moving to meet each other halfway, the two countries have set up a number of communication and coordination mechanisms such as the Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade, the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, and the Comprehensive Economic Dialogue, the white paper said.
Cause_General	Each has made tremendous efforts over the past 40 years to overcome all kinds of obstacles and move economic and trade relations forward, which has served as the ballast and propeller of the overall bilateral relationship, according to the white paper.
Distant_Evaluation	"However, the new administration of the U.S. government has trumpeted ""America First"" since taking office in 2017, and has abandoned the fundamental norms of mutual respect and equal consultation that guide international relations, said the white paper."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Rather, it has brazenly preached unilateralism, protectionism and economic hegemony, making false accusations against many countries and regions, particularly China, intimidating other countries through economic measures such as imposing tariffs, and attempting to impose its own interests on China through extreme pressure,"" according to the white paper."
Distant_Evaluation	The white paper stressed China has responded from the perspective of the common interests of both parties as well as the world trade order, observing the principle of resolving disputes through dialogue and consultation, and answering the U.S. concerns with the greatest level of patience and good faith.
Distant_Evaluation	The Chinese side has been dealing with these differences with an attitude of seeking common ground while shelving divergence, the white paper said.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It has overcome many difficulties and made enormous efforts to stabilize China-U.S. economic and trade relations by holding rounds of discussions with the U.S. side and proposing practical solutions."""
Distant_Evaluation	However, the U.S. side has been contradicting itself and constantly challenging China, the white paper said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""As a result, trade and economic friction between the two sides has escalated quickly over a short period of time, causing serious damage to the economic and trade relations which have developed over the years through the collective work of the two governments and the two peoples, and posing a grave threat to the multilateral trading system and the principle of free trade."""
Cause_Specific	The Chinese government published the white paper to clarify the facts about China-U.S. economic and trade relations, demonstrate China's stance on trade friction with the United States, and pursue reasonable solutions.
Main	PARIS (Reuters) - France has no plans for now to sell its 14 percent stake in Air France-KLM (AIRF.PA), Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Thursday, pressing the group’s new chief executive to focus on increasing competitiveness.
Error	FILE PHOTO: French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire attends a news conference at the Bercy Finance Ministry in Paris, France, August 30, 2018.

Cause_Specific	Le Maire was reacting to a warning from the group’s new Canadian boss, Benjamin Smith, to Air France’s labour unions that the government was prepared to offload its shares and they should not rely on the state to bail them out.
Cause_General	Smith, who took over the group last week, faces the unenviable task of having to overcome union resistance to reduce the French unit’s swollen cost base while keeping increasingly frustrated Dutch staff on side.
Cause_Specific	A wave of strikes at Air France this spring cost the group some 350 million euros ($410 million) and led to the ouster of Smith’s predecessor.
Distant_Evaluation	“Today the priority is to turn around Air France,” Le Maire told franceinfo.
Distant_Evaluation	“Selling off the state’s stake in Air France is not part of Benjamin Smith’s action plan.
Distant_Evaluation	It is not an option on the table today.”
Cause_General	Shares in Air France KLM rose 1.6 percent, although the stock remains down by nearly 40 percent so far in 2018.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In an interview published on Thursday, Smith told the Financial Times that the French government should not and would not bail out Air France to shield it from competition, even if there were some in the company that believed the state’s holding offered them protection.
Distant_Historical	Le Maire himself warned Air France staff in May that the government would not come to the airline’s rescue.
Cause_General	The French state is the largest shareholder in Air France-KLM.
Distant_Evaluation	What President Emmanuel Macron does with the stake will be a test of the former investment banker’s resolve to lighten the state’s touch on the economy.
Distant_Evaluation	Le Maire said it made no sense for the state to sell down its stake in Air France while the airline is attempting to make tough reforms and at a time its share price is suffering.
Distant_Evaluation	“The state would be a poor manager (of its holdings) if it started selling its shares in a company that is not in good shape,” he said.
Cause_General	Air France-KLM’s shares have been hit this year, mainly due to the strikes waged by French unions seeking improved pay and working conditions.
Cause_General	Delta Airlines (DAL.N) and China Eastern Airlines (600115.SS) each hold an 8.8 percent stake in the group.

Cause_General	At the end of this July, when a deadly flash flood swept through Attapeu province of southern Laos, China Railway, a Chinese company constructing the China-Laos Railway in the country, provided assistance to the disaster-stricken areas without any hesitation.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, Lao Asia Pacific Satellite Co., Ltd. (LAOSAT), a joint venture between China and Laos, immediately sent a technical team to provide live satellite television broadcast and emergency communication service for the victims and rescuers in the disaster-stricken Attapeu, and transmit real-time video content through the satellite network at the forefront of the disaster area.
Distant_Evaluation	These cases are not rare in Laos nowadays.
Distant_Evaluation	Chinese enterprises have been playing an increasingly important role in enhancing people's livelihood with practical actions.
Cause_General	Nam Ou River is the largest eastern tributary of the Mekong River in Laos.
Cause_General	It is one of the key hydropower resource bases that the Lao government is pushing forward to explore.
Main	PowerChina is developing a full basin cascade hydropower project at that site.
Main	As of August this year, the first phase of the project has been put into operation and has delivered more than 3 billion KWh of electricity to the northern part of Laos.
Cause_General	The second phase of the project is expected to be completed by 2020 and will guarantee 12 percent of the electricity supply in Laos.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Based on the actual needs of Laos, integrating with Laos' social and economic development and people's livelihood planning, we creatively propose a scientific development plan of seven-dam cascade project, which is fully recognized by the Lao government,"" said Huang Yande, assisting general manager of PowerChina Resources Limited and general manager of the branch company in Laos."
Cause_General	Bounpong Ketsadasak used to work with Laos' state-owned Electricite Du Laos (EDL) and now works as a deputy general manager in charge of PowerChina's Nam Ou phase one project.
Distant_Evaluation	"Ketsadasak said that the Laos' strategy of ""Battery of Southeast Asia"" goes well with the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative, and Nam Ou cascade hydropower project was a great achievement of the Belt and Road Initiative."
Distant_Evaluation	"""The Belt and Road is a great cause."
Distant_Evaluation	"As a witness and participant, I will be devoted to it with my Chinese colleagues,"" said the Lao manager."
Cause_General	Bounthong Chitmany, deputy prime minister of the Lao government, spoke highly of the construction and operation of the Nam Ou cascade hydropower project and its contribution to local economic and social development.
Distant_Historical	Back in the 1990s, Sinohydro Bureau 10 Co., LTD undertook the construction of Nam Leuk Hydropower Plant, which was widely praised by the local government and society.
Cause_General	The successful construction of the Nam Leuk has consolidated a market position for Sinohydro Bureau 10 Co., LTD in Lao hydropower industry.
Distant_Evaluation	Yu Mingchuan, deputy general manager of Sinohydro Bureau 10 and general manager of its Lao branch, told Xinhua that thanks to scientific management and hard work, the company has been recognized as an international and professional construction team with a good reputation in Laos.
Distant_Evaluation	The company is well-known in Laos for its capabilities of constructing large and medium-sized hydropower projects and installing electro-mechanical equipment.

Main	MINSK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Belarus’ largest grocery retailer Eurotorg is set to become the country’s first company to list on an overseas stock market, as economic stability and a friendlier business environment allow non state-run enterprises to flourish.
Cause_General	Eurotorg, which has a 19 percent market share and is five times larger than its closest domestic competitor, will file documents to Britain’s regulator needed to hold an initial public offering as early as this week.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The company, which last year became the first from Belarus to issue a Eurobond, expects to raise around $200 million in new money.
Distant_Evaluation	A source familiar with the matter said the company was valued at up to $1.5 billion on a pre money basis, which does not take into consideration the capital the company will receive in the IPO.
Distant_Evaluation	It’s an important step for Belarus, whose strongman President Alexander Lukashenko has, since a financial crisis in 2014-2015, loosened his grip on private enterprises and cut subsidies to state firms that have dominated since Soviet times.
Cause_General	Inflation is stable at a historic low of around 5 percent while the economy is growing at around 4.5 percent a year.
Distant_Evaluation	“The economy probably hasn’t been in a healthier state in the last 20 years,” Eurotorg Chief Executive Andrei Zubkou told Reuters in an interview.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Proceeds from the listing will be used to partially repay the company’s foreign currency debt, and its core shareholders are expected to retain their majority shareholding.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The supermarket chain will continue expanding by opening new stores in small towns and rural areas where Zubkou says it has practically no competitors.
Cause_General	It has already launched 100 such shops.
Cause_General	“1.8 million people live in small settlements.
Distant_Evaluation	This is essentially a new market,” said Zubkou.
Cause_General	Set up in the 1990s as a wholesaler, Eurotorg is the country’s largest private sector employer with around 40,000 workers.
Cause_General	The IPO will give the company access to capital markets that are currently inaccessible to companies in Belarus
Distant_Evaluation	According to Zubkou, Belarusian retail resembles the market in neighbouring Poland, a European Union member, around a decade ago, meaning firms have room to grow.
Distant_Evaluation	At the same time, Belarus’ protectionist policies have allowed companies to develop in the absence of international competition, he said.
Cause_General	Any foreign company wanting to enter Belarus must comply with rules such as stocking a high proportion of Belarusian goods on store shelves.
Distant_Evaluation	“We see no potential for the arrival of powerful foreign players,” Zubkou said.
Distant_Historical	Last year, Belarus cut red tape for businesses and made it harder for state officials to carry out inspections or shut companies’ operations without a court order.
Distant_Historical	The authorities also put a moratorium on the introduction of new taxes or the increase of current taxes until 2020.
Distant_Evaluation	“We have a feeling that Belarus as a whole, as a story, is louder and brighter today,” Andrei Matsiavin, Eurotorg’s Chief Strategy and Investment Officer, told Reuters.

Main	FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp (TKAG.DE) on Monday defended a landmark deal to split into two as concerns mounted over whether the plans, which will result in a 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) tax hit, go far enough.
Error	FILE PHOTO: A logo of ThyssenKrupp AG is pictured outside the ThyssenKrupp headquarters in Essen, November 23, 2017.
Error	REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen/File Photo
Cause_General	Last week Thyssenkrupp said it would spin off its elevators, car parts and plant engineering units into a separate listed entity named Thyssenkrupp Industrials, while keeping steel and materials-related activities.
Main	In the first analyst call since the plans were announced, Thyssenkrupp Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff, who was given a five-year contract on Sunday, said the new structure would reduce complexity and give shareholders a more transparent asset to invest in.
Distant_Evaluation	Some analysts said however that Thyssenkrupp Industrials, while more focused, would still be a complex entity.
Main	“Ultimately, we’ve gone from one big conglomerate to two smaller conglomerates,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Cedar Ekblom said during the call.
Main	“TK Industrials has got three divisions, which are all capital goods businesses, but ultimately, are very different businesses with very different end-markets.”
Error	Related Coverage Factbox: Thyssenkrupp breaks into two
Main	Kerkhoff said, however, that the links between the divisions were significant.
Main	“There is some glue between the three,” he said.
Main	“They’re all depending on the same megatrends in the world.
Main	They’re all depending on engineering and service competencies throughout the businesses.”
Main_Consequence	Shares in the company fell as much as 4.7 percent after the call.
Cause_Specific	The corporate split came in response to years of shareholder pressure to simplify Thyssenkrupp’s sprawling conglomerate set-up.
Distant_Evaluation	Analysts have pointed out that the group still needs a strategy for the business following the structural change.
Distant_Evaluation	The split bears similarity to E.ON’s (EONGn.DE) spin-off of Uniper (UN01.DE), in which the German utility kept a minority stake which it said could be sold on the open market.
Cause_General	It was ultimately acquired by Finnish peer Fortum (FORTUM.HE).
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In a similar vein, Thyssenkrupp, which will be renamed Thyssenkrupp Materials, will quickly move to sell the minority stake in Thyssenkrupp Industrials it will still hold after the spin-off is complete.
Main	“The sooner the better,” Kerkhoff said, adding that Thyssenkrupp Materials would sell at the highest possible price as soon as the market could absorb it.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The corporate split still requires shareholder approval, which is expected by early 2019.
Main	“Thyssenkrupp Materials is sustainable without the stake in Thyssenkrupp Industrials,” Kerkhoff said.
Cause_Specific	Stocks have been a great investment in the last 80 years, with an average return of about 10 percent a year.
Distant_Evaluation	But have investors in the stock market done as well as stocks?
Distant_Evaluation	Surprisingly, the answer is no.
Cause_Specific	The average dollar invested in the stock market in those years has earned only about 8.6 percent a year.
Main	The discrepancy between stock market return and investor return is examined by Ilia D. Dichev, a University of Michigan accounting professor, in a paper published in the March 2007 edition of The American Economic Review, ''What Are Stock Investors' Actual Historical Returns?
Main	Evidence From Dollar-Weighted Returns.''
Distant_Evaluation	To understand the difference between a stock's return and an investor's return, consider someone who buys 100 shares of a company at a price of $10 a share.
Distant_Evaluation	A year later, the share price is up to $20, and the investor buys 100 more shares.
Distant_Evaluation	Alas, the investor's luck has run out.
Distant_Evaluation	By the end of the next year, the price has fallen back to $10 and the investor sells his 200 shares.
Distant_Evaluation	A buy-and-hold investor who bought at $10, held the stock for two years, and then sold at $10 would have had a zero return.
Distant_Evaluation	But our friend who tried to time the market did much worse: over the two years, he invested $3,000 in the stock and ended up with only $2,000.
Distant_Evaluation	E
Distant_Evaluation	ven though the stock broke even, the investor lost money because of bad timing: most of his money was invested right before the market fell.
Cause_General	To calculate a meaningful measure of the investor's return, it is necessary to weight the yearly returns by the dollars invested during that year.
Distant_Evaluation	When Mr. Dichev calculates the dollar-weighted returns on this stock according to his preferred method, our hypothetical investor's average yearly return ends up being negative 16.8 percent, far below the zero return that the buy-and-hold investor would have received.
Cause_General	Some mutual fund families and reporting services currently report dollar-weighted returns for individual investors and funds.
Cause_General	Mr. Dichev's contribution is to apply this methodology to the stock market as a whole, weighting each month's return by the amount of money invested in the market during that period.
Distant_Historical	An investor who bought a value-weighted portfolio of stocks in the New York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange in 1926 and held them until 2002 would have earned an average annual return of about 10 percent.
Distant_Historical	By contrast, an individual who bought in 1926 but moved his dollars in and out of the market in the same pattern as the average dollar invested in the market would have earned a return of only 8.6 percent a year.
Distant_Historical	For Nasdaq, the difference between buy-and-hold and dollar-weighted returns is even larger.
Distant_Historical	An investor who bought the Nasdaq index in 1973 and sold in 2002 would have earned an average yearly return of 9.6 percent.
Distant_Historical	But the typical investor in Nasdaq earned only 4.3 percent over this period.
Cause_General	This is true not just in the United States -- the same thing occurred in 18 of 19 international markets that Mr. Dichev examined.
Distant_Evaluation	It appears that taken as a whole, investors just aren't very good at market timing.
Distant_Evaluation	But why?
Distant_Evaluation	There's an old adage on Wall Street: ''Buy on the rumor, sell on the news.''
Distant_Evaluation	Unfortunately, small investors do not seem to follow this rule.
Distant_Evaluation	Terrance Odean, a finance professor at the University of California, Berkeley, has found that small individual investors tend to buy stocks when they are mentioned in the media: they buy on the news.
Distant_Evaluation	The professional and institutional investors are happy to sell to retail investors in such periods.
Cause_General	A recent article in The Financial Analysts Journal by Thomas Arnold, John H. Earl Jr. and David S. North, all finance professors at the University of Richmond, called ''Are Cover Stories Effective Contrarian Indicators?''
Cause_General	offers an intriguing finding.
Cause_General	The professors look at how a company's stock responds to a cover story in BusinessWeek, Fortune and Forbes.
Cause_General	They find that positive stories follow periods of positive performance and negative stories follow periods of negative performance, which admittedly is not too surprising.
Cause_General	More interesting, they also find that the appearance of a cover story tends to signal the end of the abnormal performance.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Hence, individuals who trade on such ''news'' are not likely to do well.
Distant_Evaluation	This is not to say that articles in the financial press are not worth reading.
Distant_Evaluation	Quite the contrary.
Distant_Evaluation	They often provide insightful reporting and in-depth analysis.
Distant_Evaluation	But by the time the articles have been researched, written and published, they are no longer news -- the market price of the stock already reflects the company's future prospects.
Cause_General	Taken together, this research offers yet more support for the time-tested investment strategy of buy and hold.
Distant_Evaluation	Anything that you think is news is old hat to the professionals.
Distant_Evaluation	Trying to outguess the market is a sucker's game.
Cause_General	ECONOMIC SCENE Hal R. Varian is a professor of business, economics and information management at the University of California, Berkeley.
Distant_Evaluation	Correction: May 10, 2007, Thursday The Economic Scene column in Business Day last Thursday, about research into the discrepancy between stock market returns and individual investors' returns, misstated the average yearly dollar-weighted return for a hypothetical investor who bought 100 shares of a company at $10 a share, then a year later bought 100 more shares when the share price was $20, then sold all 200 shares when the price fell to $10 a share at the end of that second year.
Distant_Evaluation	The investor's average yearly return was a negative 26.8 percent, not a negative 16.8 percent.
Distant_Historical	Private equity has done much bigger deals in the last two years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But the $8 billion buyout for Harman International Industries, the maker of JBL speakers and Harman Kardon home theater systems, may prove the most groundbreaking.
Main	The buyers, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Goldman Sachs, have offered Harman shareholders a chance to retain a stake in the newly private company and share in any profit made if the company is later sold or taken public.
Main	Under the terms of the deal, the public shareholders could hold as much as 27 percent of the private company.
Distant_Evaluation	The offer represents a major concession to public shareholders, who have increasingly voiced concern about selling their shares to private equity firms only to watch the new owners reap large profits by flipping the companies a few years later, and in some cases a few months.
Distant_Evaluation	The Harman deal tries to assuage stockholders by using a provision known as a stub, as in a ticket stub, apparently its first use in the United States amid the latest buyout boom.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Douglas A. Cifu, a partner at the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison, said that companies and shareholders might press harder for stub provisions in future buyouts and that private equity might be more willing to offer them.
Distant_Evaluation	''It helps mute some of the criticism that private equity firms are taking all the upside for themselves and are quick-flip artists,'' Mr. Cifu said.
Distant_Anecdotal	Frederick E. Rowe Jr., a money manager in Dallas who derides many private equity buyouts as ''open sores,'' said last night that the use of a stub in the Harman deal was a step in the right direction.
Distant_Anecdotal	Should stubs become more prevalent, Mr. Rowe said, shareholders may no longer lose out on their investments.
Distant_Anecdotal	''Rather than just arbitrarily squeeze shareholders out, shareholders can now participate,'' he said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''I don't see any downsides as all.''
Distant_Evaluation	But stubs are not a panacea for shareholders.
Distant_Evaluation	Private equity deals often take several years to realize a profit, and investors must be willing to have their holdings locked up in the interim.
Distant_Evaluation	Moreover, not all deals make a profit, leaving buyout firms and stub holders with a loss.
Distant_Evaluation	At the same time, the public shareholders would be at the whim of the private equity holders with little or no say in the business.
Cause_General	The use of a stub in the Harman deal comes after a similar provision was suggested, but ultimately not used, in the sale of Clear Channel Communications, the nation's largest radio company.
Cause_General	After two investors in Clear Channel -- Fidelity Investments and Highfields Capital Management, a hedge fund -- balked at the price, the two suitors, Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners, sent a letter to the Clear Channel board proposing alternatives to raise their offer.
Cause_General	Among them was a stub for existing shareholders.
Cause_General	But the bidders eventually chose to raise their offer to $27.6 billion, from $26 billion.
Distant_Evaluation	And stubs sometimes have failed to entice shareholders into selling their companies.
Cause_General	This month, a private equity group in Britain seeking to buy J Sainsbury, the supermarket chain, sweetened its bid by offering up to 25 percent of the company to its shareholders.
Cause_General	In the end, the retailer's founding family, which holds 18 percent of the company's shares, rejected the offer.
Cause_General	Beyond the stub, owners of Harman stock would receive $120 a share, a 17 percent premium over the closing price on Wednesday.
Distant_Evaluation	Shares of Harman rose $19.94, or 19.44 percent, to $122.50, suggesting that investors may be anticipating a higher rival offer.
Cause_General	Harman can solicit competing bids for 50 days.
Cause_General	For Sidney Harman, the 88-year-old founder of the company, who owns about 5 percent of its stock, the sale will not end his involvement in the business, which he started in 1953.
Main	As part of the deal, which is expected to close this summer, he will remain as executive chairman.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Harman has sold the company before, once for $100 million in 1977 after he joined the Carter administration as an assistant commerce secretary.
Cause_General	(His wife, Jane Harman, is a United States representative from California.)
Distant_Historical	The company performed poorly under the owner at the time, the Beatrice Company, and Mr. Harman bought it back in 1980 for $55 million.
Distant_Evaluation	The environment for private equity has grown toxic in other ways as well.
Cause_General	Unions in the United States and Europe, critical of the cuts in jobs or worker benefits that often accompany buyouts, have called for increased government scrutiny of the deals.
Cause_General	This week, a report released by the Service Employees International Union, which represents nearly two million workers, suggested that lawmakers examine certain tax breaks that buyout firms enjoy.
Main	After another feverish day of buying in this country's amazing bull run, share prices in China broke records again Wednesday, sending the benchmark Shanghai composite index past the 4,000-point level for the first time.
Main	On a day when share prices also rallied in Hong Kong and in the southern city of Shenzhen, the Shanghai index closed at 4,013.09, up 1.6 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	''Here we go,'' said Stephen Green, a longtime stock market analyst working here for Standard Chartered Bank.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''Next stop: 5,000.''
Cause_General	Share prices have already risen 50 percent in Shanghai this year, after gains of 130 percent in 2006.
Cause_General	And in just over four months, the Shenzhen composite index is up 100 percent this year.
Distant_Evaluation	The striking advances are again raising concerns about the possibility of government intervention in a market that is wasting no time rewriting the record books.
Cause_General	But the authorities in Beijing are facing difficult choices: does it make sense to puncture a frenzied market at a time when investors are more eager than ever to invest in equities, or do nothing and allow the index to race up 1,000 points further?
Distant_Historical	Just two years ago, this market was nearly asleep, with the Shanghai composite index hovering around 1,200.
Distant_Historical	The country's other major stock barometer, in Shenzhen, was even more depressed.
Cause_General	But for the last 18 months or so, Chinese stock prices have soared , luring a nation of savers who are now finding few better places to put their money to work than in stocks.
Distant_Evaluation	Analysts say the market has also been buoyed by new regulations, rising corporate profits and a softening real estate market in 2006, which made stocks an attractive alternative.
Cause_General	These days, people wait in long lines outside banks and brokerage houses to open accounts, and they crowd into small rooms to spend the day watching stock monitors.
Cause_General	They are retirees, college students taking out loans to invest in hot stocks, and homeowners who say they have sold apartments to buy shares of China Mobile or Sinopec.
Cause_General	On the most fevered days, Chinese investors are opening hundreds of thousands of accounts, according to the state-run news media.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some publicly listed companies are said to be raising money from the market, only to plow it back into stocks in the hope of earning even better returns.
Distant_Anecdotal	Mr. Green at Standard Chartered says price-to-earnings ratios, perhaps the best-known measure of the value of a stock, are extremely high in Shanghai.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The government could take moderate steps to slow this growth.
Distant_Evaluation	But officials worry about bursting a bubble and setting off waves of selling.
Distant_Anecdotal	''The risk of Beijing intervening between now and 5,000 is high,'' Mr. Green said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''The question is when.''
Cause_General	Government officials have also sounded warnings about ''blind optimism'' in the market, overzealous buying and a resulting stock market bubble.
Cause_General	They are also concerned about stock scams, deceptive mutual fund practices and insider trading.
Distant_Historical	Perhaps the biggest test came on Feb. 27, when share prices plummeted nearly 9 percent in Shanghai, the biggest one-day drop in a decade, helping to spread a global stock sell-off.
Cause_General	But investors rushed back into the market, pushing the Shanghai composite index past 3,000 again in March, and now, slightly more than two months later, all the way up to 4,000.
Cause_General	Share prices in Hong Kong have also been buoyed by huge initial public offerings of Chinese companies.
Cause_General	The benchmark Hang Seng index there closed at 20,844.78 on Wednesday, just below its record high.
Distant_Evaluation	Chang Chun, professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School, questions whether corporate profits, which may be high, are high enough to justify the current levels of stock prices.
Distant_Evaluation	''Earnings have gone up a lot in the last year,'' he says.
Distant_Evaluation	''But this market is up a bit too high.''
Main	Shareholders of AMR, the parent company of American Airlines, rejected at the annual meeting on Wednesday two proposals aimed at setting controls on executive pay.
Cause_Specific	The Allied Pilots Association had sponsored a resolution to give stockholders an advisory vote on executive compensation each year.
Main	Votes representing about 59 percent of AMR's shares went against the proposal.
Main	A second resolution that was also defeated would have required that 75 percent of stock options or restricted stock awards given to executives be based on performance.
Main	A third proposal, to change the way votes for directors are cast, was rejected.
Main	The only stockholder-sponsored resolution to pass, with 54 percent in favor, concerned special shareholder meetings.
Cause_General	It was proposed by John Chevedden, an AMR stockholder who owns 100 shares.
Cause_General	It establishes a process by which owners of 10 percent of the company's outstanding common shares can call a special shareholder meeting.
Distant_Evaluation	It is similar to proposals recently passed by Electronic Data Systems, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.
Cause_General	Mr. Chevedden noted in the proposal that the mutual fund giants Fidelity and Vanguard, as well as guidelines from public pension funds, support this right.
Cause_General	No person or investment group in AMR now meets this 10 percent threshold.
Cause_General	The two-hour meeting was punctuated by wide-ranging comments from shareholders, investors and union representatives.
Distant_Evaluation	Some spoke of bitterness and betrayal, while others commended management for stewarding the company back to profitability from the brink of bankruptcy.
Cause_General	Representatives of the Transport Workers Union presented the chairman and chief executive of AMR, Gerard J. Arpey, with an online petition bearing 17,000 signatures that protested AMR's executive compensation practices.
Cause_General	AMR employees and unions have taken pay cuts and made other concessions worth $1.62 billion a year through 2008.
Cause_Specific	Last month, the company's top executives received $21 million in bonuses, a figure that generated more than 500,000 e-mail messages in protest.
Distant_Evaluation	Union members feel betrayed by such bonuses, said a spokesman, Bobby Gless.
Distant_Evaluation	By contrast, Edward Shapiro, a partner at PAR Capital Management, lauded AMR's board for its performance during the difficult period since 2002.
Cause_General	Last month, AMR announced an $81 million first-quarter profit.
Distant_Historical	In 2006, the company earned $231 million.
Distant_Evaluation	In his remarks to the shareholders, Mr. Arpey noted that this was the first time in six years that AMR had been profitable for four consecutive quarters.
Distant_Evaluation	He said that the company had been ''scratching and clawing our way back up since 2002'' and had reached a point where it was no longer endeavoring to save itself.
Distant_Evaluation	He answered criticism of AMR's executive compensation by noting that the company had contributed more than $1.5 billion to its employees' defined-benefit pension plans since 2002, a period during which several rival airlines sought bankruptcy protection.
Distant_Evaluation	He commended the company's employees and unions for their cost-cutting efforts and for the ways they had helped increase revenue, including through aircraft maintenance contracts with other carriers.

Main	BEIJING, Jan. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's latest campaign against organized crime and officials who hide criminal organizations reflects President Xi Jinping's outlook on security and his people-centered governance thought, according to academics.
Cause_General	"According to a document released by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council Wednesday, the fight will focus on industries and areas prone to organized crimes that prompt the ""strongest public reaction"" and that which is ""detested"" by the people."
Cause_General	"The document said China would maintain a tough stance against ""all types of organized crime."""
Distant_Evaluation	The CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping at its core has attached great importance to national security and people's security since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012.
Cause_General	"In the report delivered to the 19th CPC National Congress in 2017, Xi, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, listed ""pursuing a holistic approach to national security"" as one of the 14 points underpinning China's endeavor to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics in the new era."
Distant_Evaluation	"""We must put national interests first, take protecting our people's security as our mission and safeguarding political security as a fundamental task,"" Xi said."
Distant_Evaluation	While addressing a seminar on national security in February last year, Xi said national security work was essential to protecting people's interests.
Distant_Evaluation	"""People's expectations on fairness, justice and security have become higher, but mafia-like gangs impact on people's sense of benefit and happiness,"" said Xu Hanming, a professor with Zhongnan University of Economics and Law."
Distant_Evaluation	Compared with previous campaigns, which are focused on social security, the latest one is primarily aimed at consolidating the CPC ruling foundation, strengthening political power at the grassroots level and safeguarding lasting peace and stability for the country.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""The campaign effectively responds to the aspirations of the people to live a better life and is a necessary measure to combat corruption and foster a healthy atmosphere of integrity in society,"" said Meng Jingtao, an executive director of Youdu law firm in southwestern China's Sichuan Province."
Distant_Evaluation	"As organized crime is deeply interwoven with corruption, the latest campaign will also deal with the protective ""umbrellas"" of gang crime."

Error	Prime Minister of Sweden Stefan Lofven (front R) and his wife Ulla Lofven walk out a polling station after casting their votes in Stockholm, Sweden, Sept. 9, 2018.
Error	Polling stations opened in Sweden on Sunday morning as the country headed for an election that looks set to turn the nationalist Sweden Democrat Party into political kingmakers.
Error	(Xinhua/Shi Tiansheng)
Main	STOCKHOLM, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) --- Polling stations opened in Sweden on Sunday morning as the country headed for an election that looks set to turn the nationalist Sweden Democrat Party into political kingmakers.
Cause_General	The final opinion polls published before Election Day predicted a neck-to-neck race between the center-left and center-right blocs, with the current government coalition partners -- the Social Democrats and the Greens -- along with the Left Party polling at 39.9 percent in a survey conducted by Novus on behalf of Swedish Television.
Cause_General	The four-party center-right Alliance was just behind, at 38.5 percent.
Cause_Specific	In the same Novus poll, the Sweden Democrats came out second in terms of single party's support, with 19.1 percent of respondents opting for the party, which is often labeled as populist and far right.
Cause_General	They have vowed to be tougher on immigration than any other political party in Sweden and want the Scandinavian nation to leave the European Union.
Cause_Specific	In other recent polls, the Sweden Democrats have scored between around 16 and 25 percent, which would signify a significant boost compared to their 2014 election result, when they gained nearly 13 percent of the vote.
Cause_General	Immigration and integration have been central themes in Sweden's shorter-than-usual election campaign, with Election Day now scheduled on the second rather than the third Sunday of September.
Cause_General	Another Novus poll, published on Sept. 6, showed that immigration/integration is the second most important issue for Swedish voters, behind healthcare and ahead of schools/education.
Distant_Evaluation	"Issues like crime and law and order have also dominated debates, especially after a series of car arson attacks in western Sweden last month and with gun violence on the rise, particularly in so-called ""vulnerable areas"" that are marred by social exclusion and relatively high crime rates."
Distant_Evaluation	However, climate change also shot to prominence following this summer's unusually high temperatures and dramatic wildfires.
Distant_Evaluation	The Sweden Democrats, who want Sweden, at least temporarily, to stop taking in quota refugees as well as asylum seekers from countries outside of the Nordic region, have dominated the national conversation as the other seven parliamentary parties have positioned themselves against them, vowing not to form a government, or negotiate, with the party that is led by Jimmie Akesson.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With neither political bloc set to gain a majority of the vote and neither willing to secure a majority by collaborating with the Sweden Democrats, the government formation question is still up in the air, with widespread talk of tactical voting among Swedes.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Analysts and commentators speculate that there will be political bargaining across the left-right divide after the votes are counted.
Distant_Historical	Sweden faced a similar deadlock situation in 2014, when a snap election was avoided because the center-right Alliance (made up of the Moderates, the Center Party, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats) decided to abstain from blocking the Social Democrat-Green Party budget in a deal known as the December Agreement.
Distant_Evaluation	"This time around, neither bloc has said they are willing to repeat such a deal, which proved controversial among the electorate and, some analysts say, helped boost support for the Sweden Democrats, cementing their self-appointed status as Sweden's ""only opposition party""."
Main	The Sweden Democrats, on their part, could end up with a key role in shaping the next government, even if they are unlikely to be part of one, as they may have the power to bring down any minority government that they oppose.
Cause_Specific	Under Sweden's negative parliamentarian system, a government does not need to have a majority in favor of it, as long as there is no majority against it.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If the current Prime Minister Stefan Lofven is asked by the Speaker of Parliament to form a government following the election and the Sweden Democrats vote against it, the Speaker may then turn to Ulf Kristersson, the leader of the opposition, instead.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Sweden Democrats could support Kristersson's government or simply abstain from voting, thereby offering it passive support.
Distant_Evaluation	The potential post-election scenarios and what role the Sweden Democrats will play have also dominated debates and party-leader interviews during the campaign.
Cause_General	"Akesson and his party again dominated the news over the weekend after the national broadcaster SVT, in an unprecedented move, made a statement against what they called a ""great generalization"" on Akesson's behalf."
Cause_General	"That was after he sparred with other party leaders in a televised debate on Friday evening over unemployment rates among immigrants, suggesting it is hard for newcomers to get jobs because they ""do not fit in"" and ""are not Swedish""."
Distant_Evaluation	Akesson added that immigrants must get opportunities to become Swedish and to integrate into the labor market and wider society.
Cause_General	After SVT refused to retract their statement, the Sweden Democrats decided to boycott the state broadcaster for the remainder of the campaign, canceling TV appearances on Election Day.
Distant_Historical	The Sweden Democrat Party first entered parliament in 2010 and was founded 30 years ago by individuals with links to neo-Nazi movements.
Cause_General	"The party now operates a ""zero-tolerance policy"" on racism but has also ousted several representatives recently who were found to have made racist remarks online."
Cause_General	The party gained growing support following the 2015 refugee crisis, when over 160,000 people applied for asylum in Sweden, a country with a population of 10 million.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Since then, the government has tightened immigration controls and laws, but the latest prognosis from the Swedish Migration Agency shows that 122,000 people are expected to apply for asylum in Sweden between 2018 and 2021.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A further 181,000 look set to arrive under family reunification rules, though that figure includes relatives of people born in Sweden.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The total number of people who are expected to be granted asylum or to receive residence permits under family reunification rules between 2018 and 2021 is 150,000.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While the Social Democrats on Sunday may get the lowest share of the vote in more than a century and the main opposition, the conservative Moderates, look set to lose their position as Sweden's second biggest party, smaller parties are doing comparatively well.
Cause_General	Polls suggest that support for the ex-Communist Left Party could double compared to the 2014 election, and the Center Party -- an agrarian party that has shifted its focus towards free-market economics and in this election has staked its claims as the most liberal on immigration out of all the four opposition Alliance parties -- is now the fifth most popular party.
Cause_General	That is according to the Sept. 6 Novus poll.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Exit polls are expected shortly after 8 p.m. on Sunday, when polling closes across the country.
Main	Egyptian officials are hoping to add powers to the Constitution that would allow the president to more easily dissolve Parliament and give him free rein to suspend civil liberties and imprison anyone deemed a terrorist threat.
Main	The Egyptian public will be asked to vote Monday on a package of 34 amendments to the Constitution that the government says represent political reform, in part by making it easier for opposition candidates to run for president.
Distant_Evaluation	But political opposition and international human rights groups say the package appears more an effort by the governing party to secure its monopoly on power and give constitutional legitimacy to police powers that have long been criticized as excessive and undemocratic.
Cause_General	The sharpest debate has been over three areas of proposed change.
Cause_General	One would ultimately allow broad powers to monitor and detain people accused of terrorist activities while not specifically defining terrorism.
Cause_General	Another would limit the role of judges in monitoring elections, which are often mired in accusations of fraud.
Cause_General	And a third would prohibit the creation of any religious political parties.
Distant_Evaluation	''There is one political regime, and one ruling party with a monopoly over power and wealth, and it wants to give the false impression that there is an ongoing process of political reform,'' said Hassan Nafaa, a political scientist at Cairo University.
Distant_Evaluation	''In reality, it is an assertion of the control of the ruling party.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The government, however, says the amendments would allow true reform because they would also redistribute powers among the president, the government and Parliament.
Distant_Evaluation	Parliament, for example, could with a two-thirds vote cause the collapse of the government.
Distant_Evaluation	But the president would have the power to dissolve Parliament without first asking for a public referendum, as current law requires.
Distant_Evaluation	The amendments were debated for months in Parliament, then emerged largely unchanged from what had been proposed by the government and the governing party of President Hosni Mubarak.
Cause_General	The State Information Service, the public relations arm of the government, plans to publish a summary of the amendments in every newspaper over three days, starting Saturday -- just two days before the polls open.
Cause_General	The actual text of the amendment is not widely available.
Cause_General	The election had been planned for the first week of April, but it was moved to Monday in a late night vote a week ago in Parliament.
Distant_Evaluation	''We are not telling people what to do; we are asking them to participate,'' said Ayman al-Kaffas, chairman of the State Information Service.
Distant_Evaluation	''We are trying to guarantee maximum integrity of the process, not the outcome of the process.''
Distant_Evaluation	Opposition groups, including the popular Muslim Brotherhood, have urged a boycott of the election.
Distant_Evaluation	With little doubt about the outcome -- no referendum has failed in modern Egypt -- Amnesty International said in a statement that the proposals represented ''the greatest erosion of human rights in 26 years.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In equally harsh language, it charged that the antiterrorism provisions would ''simply entrench the long-standing system of abuse'' in place since the adoption of emergency laws after President Anwar el-Sadat was assassinated in 1981.
Distant_Evaluation	The government strongly objected to Amnesty International's assessment, and Mr. Kaffas said antiterrorism laws, while necessary, were often unpopular, including the Patriot Act in the United States.
Distant_Evaluation	But anxiety permeated the ranks of the governing party as well.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Abdel Moneim Said, a member of the governing National Democratic Party and director of Egypt's premier research center, the government-financed Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, acknowledged concerns over aspects of the changes that could permit ''an abuse of power.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But he said the changes could also push the country toward reform.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''I think it is the accumulation of little additions here and there that can generate change eventually,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	The move is occurring at a time when the government is showing less tolerance for criticism and political opposition.
Cause_General	It has jailed opposition critics, including a member of Parliament and a former presidential candidate; it delayed local council elections by two years; it sentenced a blogger who had criticized the president to four years in prison; it has had troops fire on would-be voters to keep them away from the polls; and it has cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood, arresting members and freezing assets.
Cause_General	The Brotherhood is a banned but tolerated organization that has won wide public support by offering a network of social services throughout the country.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While the crackdown and the amendments would inhibit the Brotherhood's political activities, the group said it would do little to shut down the grassroots operations it has used to build support.
Distant_Evaluation	''We can we do?''
Distant_Evaluation	said Muhammad Habib, deputy leader of the Brotherhood.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''There is not much we can do except increase our activity and our reach to the people.''
Cause_General	Egypt receives about $1.7 billion a year in American military and development aid, and at one time was held up by the White House as the vanguard for Democratic changes in the region.
Cause_General	But the Bush administration's pressure on Mr. Mubarak to enact such changes has evaporated as it has increasingly sought help in dealing with Iran, Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
Distant_Evaluation	The United States has been tentative in its comments on the referendum, with the State Department initially saying it was an internal matter for Egypt and the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, later telling reporters it was ''disappointing.''
Distant_Evaluation	At a news conference in Aswan on Saturday morning with the United Nations secretary general, Egypt's foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit sharply rejected Ms. Rice's remarks, saying, ''This is our own development, our own country.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In a televised speech later, Mr. Mubarak insisted that Egypt would never bend to foreign ''pressure, dictation or prerequisites.''
Main	LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Political parties in Britain should be forced to reveal how many women and minorities they put up for election to parliament, lawmakers and campaigners said on Wednesday.
Cause_Specific	They said the government should take action after a recent law compelling many British companies to share the gap between how much they paid male and female staff provoked debate and pledges of change.
Distant_Anecdotal	“We don’t have equal representation in politics and there’s a distance between citizens and politics as a result,” said Helen Pankhurst, the granddaughter of British suffragette campaigner Sylvia Pankhurst.
Distant_Anecdotal	“There’s a double standard, or a bit of hypocrisy, if you demand accountability elsewhere and aren’t accountable yourself,” Pankhurst told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Cause_General	Despite sex discrimination being outlawed in the 1970s, women hold just 208 of the 650 seats in the House of Commons and are also under-represented in senior business roles.
Cause_General	Just over a quarter of the House of Lords upper chamber members are women.
Main_Consequence	Campaigners have called on the government to bring into force existing legislation that would compel parties to make public how many of their candidates are women.
Cause_General	The Government Equalities Office declined to comment, saying in a statement that it “continues to work on supporting groups to participate in politics”.
Cause_General	Politicians compete ahead of five-yearly elections to be chosen as a candidate for their party, with the final decision taken by party members in the local constituency.
Distant_Evaluation	Speaking at a round-table event hosted by the Centenary Action Group, lawmakers from the three main British parties said they had run up against sexist assumptions and stereotypes when forging their political careers.
Distant_Evaluation	Nicky Morgan, a member of parliament (MP) with the ruling Conservative Party, said when she first put herself forward, the members “still had a concept of what a candidate looked like as male, often married with children”.
Distant_Evaluation	Jo Swinson, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, said she had been quizzed about whether she planned to have children when competing against a man with a young family.
Distant_Evaluation	“The gender pay gap has put pressure on companies – people are asking questions and I think we need the same thing with political parties,” she added.
Cause_General	Britain stands at number 39 in an international index charting women’s representation in parliaments, below Rwanda, Cuba and Bolivia.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Campaigners said forcing parties to be more transparent would increase pressure on them to nurture female candidates and those from minority backgrounds.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Labour MP Dawn Butler said that would result in a “more robust type of policy”.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s important to have that intersectionality, to have different voices, not people who all went to the same school and have got all the same friends,” she said.

Main	LONDON, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- Contingency plans to deal with any widespread disorder after Britain leaves the European Union (EU) are being drawn up by senior police chiefs, it was reported Sunday in London.
Main	The Sunday Times (ST) newspaper says a bombshell document, prepared by the National Police Co-ordination Center, outlines plans to deal with widespread civil disorder at British borders and ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Main	"It adds the document warns that the necessity to call on military assistance is ""a real possibility"" in the weeks around Britain's departure from the EU next March."
Main	The report says disruption and civil unrest could last for three months either side of the March 29 departure date, rather than the six weeks being planned for by the government.
Main	The ST adds that the report is due to be discussed at an upcoming meeting of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), saying some police forces, such as Kent, are expected unilaterally to cancel rest days and leave immediately after March 29, the date Britain will leave the EU.
Cause_General	The area covered by Kent Police includes Britain's busiest sea port, Dover, the main link with mainland Europe.
Main	"The document warns that Operation Stack, the queuing system for heavy goods vehicles waiting to cross the English Channel when traffic is disrupted at the Port of Dover will have to be ""enacted in every British seaport"" requiring a heavy police commitment."
Main	"It adds, according to the ST, ""If Stack is introduced across the country, the disruption to the national road network will be unprecedented and overwhelming."""
Main	The ST also claims the document also warns that a no-deal Brexit could lead to a rise in crime, particularly theft and robbery, as Britain suffers food and drug shortages with the expectation that more people will become ill.
Main	It warns that the predominant concern for the police is that food and goods shortages, including National Health Service (NHS) supplies, will result in civil disorder leading to widespread unrest.
Distant_Evaluation	"The NPCC lead for operations, Chief Constable Charlie Hall, told the ST: ""The police are planning for all scenarios that may require a police response in the event of a no-deal Brexit."
Distant_Evaluation	At this stage, we have no intelligence to suggest there will be an increase in crime or disorder.
Distant_Evaluation	"However, we remain vigilant and will continue to assess any threats and develop plans accordingly."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Louise Haigh, policing minister spokesperson for the main opposition Labour Party, said: ""This is the nightmare scenario long feared."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"According to the UK's most senior police officers, a no-deal Brexit could leave Britain on the brink."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This week Prime Minister Theresa May's government will publish the final batch of the more than 80 reports on the possible consequences, and preparations for a no-deal Brexit.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In another Brexit development Sunday, Frances O'Grady, leader of Britain's biggest trades union body, the TUC, said that unless May's government struck a deal that working people need with the EU, she would demand a popular vote.
Cause_General	O'Grady made her comment in a television interview as trade unionists from around the country gathered in Manchester for their annual congress.
Distant_Evaluation	"O'Grady called on May's government to extend Britain's EU membership to allow longer for negotiations, adding: ""Time is running out and a crash out of the EU would be an absolute disaster for the people we represent."""
Cause_General	One of the country's biggest unions, the GMB, has already announced support for the People's Vote campaign which is demanding a referendum on a final deal brokered between Britain and the EU.
Cause_General	More than 300,000 people have so-far signed the petition calling for a so-called People's Vote.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Prime Minister May has ruled out a second referendum, saying the government is determined to deliver on the 2016 referendum, in which, by a 52-48 margin, the people of Britain chose to leave the EU.
Main	STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish political parties face weeks of haggling to form a government after voters delivered a hung parliament on Sunday, with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats saying they hold the balance of power.

Main	A preliminary allocation of parliamentary seats gave the center-left bloc - uniting the minority governing Social Democrat and Green parties with the Left Party - 144 seats versus 143 for the center-right Alliance bloc.
Main	The Sweden Democrats, who want to leave the European Union, won 62 seats, up from 49 in the 349-seat Riksdag where 175 seats are needed to form a majority.
Distant_Evaluation	Doing a deal with them would give either bloc a majority but the mainstream parties have ruled out cooperating with a party which has roots in the white supremacist fringe.
Distant_Evaluation	Both blocs have declared themselves victors in the election, but need additional support to form a viable government without the Sweden Democrats, who want influence over immigration policy.
Distant_Evaluation	There are a number of ways out of the tangle.
Error	Election results graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2CDMT4e
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	CENTER-RIGHT MINORITY RULE
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Alliance of the Moderates, Centre, Liberals and Christian Democrats looks set to be slightly smaller than the center-left.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But it will hope for backing from the Sweden Democrats to oust Prime Minister Stefan Lofven and to install Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson as his replacement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, a formal agreement with the Sweden Democrats would very likely see the Centre and Liberal parties, who want looser immigration policies, jump ship.
Cause_General	It is not clear whether the Centre and Liberal parties would take part in a government that had no formal support from the Sweden Democrats but in practice relied on their votes to install a prime minister.
Cause_General	On Monday, Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson invited the Moderates and Christian Democrats to formal negotiations but was quickly rebuffed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Akesson said his party would vote against any government that did not give it a say in policy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	SOCIAL DEMOCRATS AND GREENS CLING ON
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Social Democrats and Greens could retain power in the unlikely event that Prime Minister Lofven survives a mandatory vote on whether to replace him.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lofven said he would remain in office in the coming weeks and called for cooperation across the political divide.
Cause_General	When voting for a prime minister in parliament, a proposal is passed unless a majority of all 349 lawmakers vote against.
Cause_General	This has allowed minority governments to rule.
Cause_General	The Alliance would need the Sweden Democrats to back a vote to oust Lofven and install Kristersson.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A GRAND COALITION
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Alliance could join a grand coalition with the Social Democrats and possibly the Greens to exclude the Sweden Democrats.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Left Party, Sweden’s former Communist party, would also be left out.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But the Moderates - the biggest party in the Alliance - are not interested in cooperating with the Social Democrats and such a deal would also raise questions about democratic accountability.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Voters might see the Sweden Democrats as the country’s only opposition party.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	MODERATE ONE-PARTY RULE
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Moderates could form a one-party government but that would require support from the Sweden Democrats as well as the smaller center-right parties.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Moderate leader Kristersson has ruled this out, and the Centre and Liberal parties would probably not go along with the idea if the Sweden Democrats were given any significant say over policy while remaining outside the government.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	NEW VOTE
Cause_General	Parliament opens on Sept. 25.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If Lofven is ousted, the speaker is allowed to give a maximum of four prime ministerial candidates the opportunity to form a government.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If they all fail, fresh elections must be called.
Cause_General	There is no formal time limit for negotiations, but the deadline for the budget is Nov. 15.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If no new government is in place by then, the current government, continuing as caretakers, would put forward a budget until a new cabinet can take office.
Distant_Evaluation	PARIS (Reuters) - Emmanuel Macron ripped up the French political textbook with surprising ease last year, but repeating the feat in Europe next year is a tall order when there are decades of perceived French arrogance to overcome.
Error	Pieyre-Alexandre Anglade speaks during an interview with Reuters at a cafe in Paris, France, September 25, 2018.
Error	REUTERS/Richard Lough
Distant_Evaluation	Pieyre-Alexandre Anglade, Macron’s European election emissary, has a front-seat role in persuading parties from across the left-right divide to rally behind the president’s drive to redraw the landscape and make Europe relevant again.
Distant_Evaluation	“Creating trust in politics takes time, creating trust in European politics takes more time, but creating trust in European politics when you’re French takes even more time,” the 31-year old soft-spoken lawmaker told Reuters in an interview.
Main	Macron, who paints next May’s European elections as a battle between progressive, pro-EU reformists and populist, far-right nationalists, is out to break the old left-right duopoly that has dominated European politics in recent decades.
Main_Consequence	He has tasked Anglade with seeking out future alliance partners from the existing conservative European People’s Party (EPP) and center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), as well as the smaller centrist ALDE group, to form a new movement inside the European Parliament.
Distant_Evaluation	“We see the system as dysfunctional and it needs rebuilding, but there’s no arrogance in our approach, we’re not here to say we’ll destroy everything because we’re the best.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	For all the professed humility, Macron is attempting nothing less than a brutal reshaping of the current political order in Brussels, just as he achieved in France, and a direct challenge to Europe’s most powerful leader, Germany’s Angela Merkel.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Merkel and Macron have forged a strong relationship, Anglade said, dismissing the suggestion Macron’s election strategy may put him on a collision course with the German chancellor, who is keeping faith with the EPP.
Distant_Evaluation	But he acknowledged Germany was “the most complicated issue” for the coming elections.
Distant_Evaluation	“Obviously, from this point of view, our interests are not necessarily aligned,” Anglade said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If Macron’s future alliance is able to edge out the EPP to become the biggest grouping, it would hand him more influence over the pick of top EU jobs and more influence on EU legislation.
Distant_Historical	No small feat for someone who only two years ago set up his own movement and blew apart France’s two-party system.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	‘NUMBER ONE FORCE’
Cause_General	Macron’s lieutenants have held talks with Italy’s center-left Democratic Party, which currently sits in the S&D group, and European Council leader Donald Tusk’s Civic Platform in Poland, which is aligned with the EPP.
Cause_General	They have also met the leaders of Spain’s centrist Ciudadanos and Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of ALDE.
Cause_General	On Thursday, his party chief Christophe Castaner penned an opinion column in European newspapers with Italy’s former prime minister Matteo Renzi, Verhofstadt and others.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We must act now, or the European project will stall.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Worse, it could be suffocated by nationalist and populist forces,” they co-wrote.
Distant_Evaluation	Anglade said Macron’s movement Republic on the Move (LREM) and ALDE shared “intellectual proximity”.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“But if we want to become the number one force, or a major force in the European parliament, we need to go beyond the ALDE base and be able to rally political parties which were once in the EPP, the Socialists or the Greens, in a new structure.”
Distant_Evaluation	“There are a certain number of parties which went to the EPP or the Socialists at one point, not because they were conservatives or Socialists, but because that’s where power was and how you got posts,” Anglade said.
Cause_General	Macron has not designated a leader for his European ambitions and in another challenge to Brussels has said he will not present a “spitzenkandidat” - a group’s candidate to become the head of the European Commission.
Distant_Evaluation	“The spitzenkandidat today is a man or a woman named by a political party in a dark room in Helsinki, Riga or wherever, who has no strong legitimacy,” Anglade said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Macron will seek businessmen, professionals and political novices to run for parliament on his party’s national ticket, just as he did in France last year, Anglade said.
Distant_Evaluation	Brussels has often been seen as a place to send political has-beens and candidates who failed at home.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We won’t send the losers of the 2017 legislatives.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And we won’t send those we’re fed up with in Paris to exile in Brussels,” he said.

Main	BEIJING, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- China's political and legal authorities promised to step up efforts to fight gangs and organized crime in 2018, vowing to shore up people's sense of security and safeguard social justice.
Cause_Specific	China's major political and legal agencies, including the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), Ministry of Public Security, and Ministry of Justice, have been respectively carrying out their national workshops and have announced annual work plans recently.
Distant_Evaluation	Political and legal workers are urged to carry out their duties to further promote fairness, transparency and efficiency.
Main	UPROOT GANGS AND ORGANIZED CRIMES
Main	Police will fight more resolutely against gangs and organized crime, and eradicate the political, economic and social conditions that foster such crime in 2018, minister of public security Zhao Kezhi said at the ministry's workshop.
Cause_General	The ministry on Wednesday announced the launch of a two-year national campaign against crime involving guns and explosives, the latest move echoing the calling.
Cause_General	The crackdown will target the manufacturing and sales of guns and explosives within China and the smuggling of related goods from overseas.
Cause_General	Also on Wednesday, three law-enforcement departments jointly began a campaign to crack down on gambling in rural areas, especially on mafia-style gangs involved in gambling-related activities.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Procurator-General Cao Jianming ordered prosecutors across the country to strengthen the fight against gang crime into a ""crushing tide."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"The SPP later issued a notice asking procuratorates at all levels to step up punishment for gang crime and its protective ""umbrellas."""
Cause_General	These gestures came after the central authorities announced a new campaign against gangs and organized crime, and their protectors, in late January.
Cause_General	In a recent action on gang crime in east China's Zhejiang Province, more than 5,000 police officers were mobilized to arrest over 1,200 suspects, seizing about 250 guns and knives.
Distant_Evaluation	IMPROVE PUBLIC POLITICAL AND LEGAL SERVICES
Distant_Evaluation	Providing better public services and protecting public interests are other key topics concerning the country's political and legal officials.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The procurator-general said that in 2018 prosecutors nationwide will improve their work on public interests litigation, especially on environmental protection, and food and drug safety.
Cause_General	According to the amendments to the Civil Procedure Law and the Administrative Procedure Law, prosecutors are now empowered to file litigation as plaintiffs against any act that compromises public rights and interests.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Ministry of Justice promised to expand legal aid services to rural areas and staff every village with at least one legal assistant by the end of 2018.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At the conference of the State Bureau for Letters and Calls, the office pledged to further improve the country's online petitioning system in 2018 to ensure better services and more transparency for government organs.

Main	"BERLIN, Oct. 5 (Xinhua) -- Markus Soeder (CSU), the governor of Bavaria, has blamed infighting in the ruling ""grand coalition"" for the current weakness of his Christian Social Union (CSU) party in opinion polls during a televised appearance on Friday."
Distant_Evaluation	"""These are all numbers which are incredibly influenced by politics in Berlin,"" Soeder said with view to the latest Infratest dimap survey in which the CSU's voter support has slumped to 33 percent in its Bavarian homestead."
Distant_Evaluation	He warned voters not to treat regional elections in his state as an opportunity to punish the federal government.
Cause_General	The CSU, the conservative sister party of chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union (CDU), has traditionally dominated politics in Bavaria by defending an absolute legislative majority there throughout most of the post-war period.
Cause_General	When polled in an Infratest dimap survey published on Thursday night, however, only 23 percent of voters said they wanted the CSU to continue ruling alone following an upcoming vote on Oct. 14.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	According to the survey, it would theoretically even be possible for the Free Democratic Party (FDP), Greens (Gruene), German Social Democrats (SPD) and Left Party (Linke) to form a government together without any participation of the incumbent.
Distant_Evaluation	"Responding to the poll, Soeder urged Bavarian voters to ""reconsider for two seconds"" before casting their ballot in less than two weeks."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""A game of a few seconds can become a five-year result."""
Main	"For Soeder, the deterioration of his party's regional ratings reflected growing voter dissatisfaction with the ""grand coalition"" formed by the CDU, CSU and SPD on a federal level."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Internal fights are always damaging, no matter who starts them,"" the governor said."
Cause_General	Soeder's party chief Horst Seehofer acts as the interior minister in the federal government and is himself seen as the foremost cause of cabinet dissent by most voters according to recent polls.
Distant_Evaluation	"Commenting on the latest confrontation between Seehofer, Merkel and the SPD over his defense of the controversial ex-intelligence chief Hans-Georg Maassen, Soeder said that there was still room for improvement in the work of the ""grand coalition""."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"At the same time, Soeder vowed that there would be ""zero cooperation"" between the CSU and Alternative for Germany (AfD) to preserve its rule in Bavaria."
Cause_General	The wealthy south eastern region is the only of Germany's 16 federal states where the CSU participates in electoral competitions.
Distant_Evaluation	In spite of the CSU downward trend in polls, Soeder insisted that the party had done well by Bavarians while in power.

Main	THE HAGUE, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- A fierce political row over migration policy triggered in Germany following violent anti-immigrant clashes in the city of Chemnitz, underlines a new line of conflict emerging within the European Union (EU) between nationalists and cosmopolitans, experts say.
Main	"""We have always defined much of European politics along the differences between Left and Right, but there is now a new line of conflict coming to the forefront, between nationalists and cosmopolitans, between those who are against migration and prefer closed borders and those, who are in favor of internationalism and openness,"" said Ben Crum, professor in political science at the Vrije University (VU) in Amsterdam."
Cause_General	MIGRATION POLICY ROW REIGNITED
Main	According to Crum, the political debate currently evolving in Germany, where the violent clashes in the city of Chemnitz reignited a row over migration policy, could be seen along this new line of conflict.
Main	"""The political debate in Germany is actually a fight over Angela Merkel's legacy, and it remains to be seen how German politics will evolve after the Chancellor concludes her term in office in some four years,"" the political expert told Xinhua, noting that ""what happens in Germany is essential to the EU."""
Cause_Specific	Violent right-wing protests broke out in Chemnitz late in August, in the eastern German state of Saxony, following the killing of a German man for which two immigrants from Syria and Iraq were arrested.
Cause_General	The clashes have deeply shaken German politics, reviving strains in German Chancellor's Angela Merkel's government and sparking an intense debate about Merkel's open border 2015 policy to let in more than a million refugees.
Distant_Evaluation	"""In German politics a lot depends on how Merkel's Christian Democrats and their allies, the Christian Social Union (CSU), succeed in becoming a stable alliance again, managing to win back voters they lost in last September's elections to far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD),"" said Mark Elchardus, Emeritus professor of sociology at the Vrij University of Brussels (VUB)."
Distant_Evaluation	Angela Merkel's government faced its deepest crisis since she became chancellor, when a dispute on migration policy between her party, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its ally, the Christian Social Union (CSU) broke out in June.
Main	Anti-immigration sentiment, which according to Elchardus is on the rise across the EU despite a sharp drop in the actual number of migrants arriving to the European Union to pre-2015 level, holds a key role in the emerging line of conflict between nationalists and cosmopolitans in Europe.
Main	"""Today the migration crisis is more about how people react to new arrivals and not about how to actually manage the number of those reaching the EU,"" said Elchardus."
Cause_General	The rate at which migrants are arriving has dropped sharply in Europe since the huge inflows in 2015.
Cause_General	According to latest data available by Frontex, the EU's border and coast guard agency, in the first eight months of 2018 the number of irregular border crossings into the EU fell 40 per cent from a year ago to about 86 500.
Distant_Historical	In 2015 more than one million refugees and migrants crossed into Europe.
Main	ORBAN VS MACRON
Main	"""On the European scene the emerging extremes of the nationalist position versus the cosmopolitan one are best embodied by Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orban on one side and by French president Emmanuel Macron on the other,"" said Crum."
Main	"""Europe looks very much a struggle between what Macron stands for and what Orban stands for,"" agreed Elchardus, noting that it is unclear how this battle for influence will evolve, especially in regards to party alliance making in the run-up to European Parliament (EP) elections in May 2019."
Main	"""The opposition between them is very clear, Macron stands for liberal democracy, he is pro-European, whereas Orban advocates illiberal democracy, he is Eurosceptic and against immigration, but it is completely unclear how this is going to translate in alliances within the European parliament,"" the sociologist said."
Cause_Specific	"Macron framed next year's European elections as a strong opposition ""between nationalists and progressives"" late in August, following statements by Italy's far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini and Orban, who labelled the French president their number one enemy."
Distant_Evaluation	Critical to further developments is whether Orban's Fidesz party remains within the conservative European People's Party (EPP), currently the largest grouping in the European Parliament.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""It is doubtful whether Orban's party will remain in the EPP,"" said Crum, noting that ""it will be more natural to either be boosted out or to be moved to a more right-wing nationalist group within the EP."""
Distant_Evaluation	Orban said in June he would prefer Fidesz to stay within the EPP and try to reform the group from the inside, but EPP members, including Merkel's Christian Democrats, have criticized some of Orban's policies.
Distant_Evaluation	Macron's strategy for the European elections is decisive on how the balance of political powers along the conflict of nationalists versus cosmopolitans will evolve within the EU.
Cause_General	"""Macron has not affiliated himself to any of the European political families and hasn't attempted to create his own group either,"" said Crum."
Distant_Evaluation	Moreover, big questions loom over Europe's Social Democrats.
Main	"""The decline of social democracy and the inability of those parties to regain their initiative, is an important factor because they have the potential of stopping the rise of far-right, anti-immigration forces,"" said Elchardus."
Cause_Specific	While Europe has seen a rise in support for far-right, anti-immigrant parties in recent national and regional elections, social democrats have experienced a sharp drop in popularity in several countries across the Continent, underlined by recent developments in Sweden.
Cause_Specific	In last week's national elections in the Nordic country the Social Democrats' vote share fell to its lowest level since 1911, while the anti-immigration nationalists Sweden Democrats made gains.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Elchardus anticipated further rise in support for anti-immigration, nationalist forces but he saw no majorities in Western European countries, where mainstream democratic parties ""manage to contain the rise of far-right by getting tougher on migration and European integration positions""."

Main_Consequence	The lack of a clear outcome from Sunday’s election dented Slovenian bond prices and the country’s main business forum urged speedy coalition talks to avert any damage to the booming economy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Slovenian President Borut Pahor will later this week meet SDS leader Janez Jansa, presidential spokeswoman Spela Vovk said, without elaborating.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The president has previously said he would nominate the leader of the biggest party as prime minister in the next couple of weeks but Jansa may struggle to win sufficient parliamentary support to lead the next government.
Cause_General	The centre-right SDS, which has the support of neighboring Hungary’s nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, won 25 of the 90 parliamentary seats but most of the other eight parties have said they will not join a coalition with the SDS.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We hope that a broad coalition can be formed which would include centre-right and centre-left parties and would have a program that would enable further economic growth,” said the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Sonja Smuc.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Political instability or a weak government without a clear development program could mean troubles for the economy and lower economic growth,” she told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	MIGRANT QUOTAS
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Jansa, a two-times former prime minister, said on Sunday the SDS would invite all other parliamentary parties to coalition talks.
Cause_General	Parliament must hold its first session within 20 days and the president then has 30 days to nominate a candidate for prime minister.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Jansa, who led the government in 2004-08 and in 2012-13, has said he wants to abolish migrant quotas, strengthen the security forces, cut taxes and speed up privatization.
Distant_Evaluation	Hungary’s Orban has also strongly opposed the European Commission’s attempts to impose quotas on all EU member states to take in migrants following the influx of large numbers of mostly Muslim refugees since 2015.
Distant_Evaluation	Only the conservative New Slovenia and right-wing Slovenian Nationalist Party have indicated a willingness to join a coalition with the SDS, but together the three would hold only 36 parliamentary seats.
Cause_General	The second biggest party in the new parliament is the centre-left List of Marjan Sarec with 13 seats.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Sarec said on Sunday he also expected to get a chance to form a government.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“A wide centre-left government looks like the baseline scenario, with risks of a new snap election not negligible,” said Alen Kovac, an analyst of Erste Group Research.
Main_Consequence	The prospect of political instability nudged the yield on Slovenia’s 10-year benchmark bond up to 1.192 percent by 1114 GMT, up from 1.149 on Friday, according to Reuters data.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Since it is clear that it will be difficult to form a government coalition and later also hard to keep it together the yield could rise a bit further,” said Saso Stanovnik, chief analyst of investment firm Alta Invest.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“However, the yield in the future will mostly depend upon the general conditions in the European Union, which have a direct impact on Slovenia’s exports, and the actions of the European Central Bank,” he added.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Exports to other EU states are the main driver of Slovenia’s economy, which the government expects to expand by 5.1 percent this year.

Main	The Chinese president urged the two sides to enhance cooperation in education, culture, sports, health and tourism, promote understanding and friendship between the youths, expand exchanges at sub-national level, and boost cooperation in judiciary, counter-terrorism and crackdown on cross-border crime.
Main	Xi also proposed that the two countries deepen communication, coordination and collaboration within the frameworks such as the United Nations and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), and jointly promote greater development in China-ASEAN relations and East Asia cooperation.
Distant_Evaluation	China supports the Brunei Darussalam-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA) cooperation and ASEAN in achieving a comprehensive, balanced development, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	On the South China Sea, Xi pointed out that it is in the vital interests of both China and Brunei to safeguard peace and stability in the South China Sea and also the shared aspiration of both peoples.
Distant_Evaluation	Xi said that China appreciates the dual-track approach proposed by Brunei: disputes should be handled through friendly consultation by parties concerned and countries in the region should jointly safeguard stability in the South China Sea.
Main	Both sides should continue to advance maritime cooperation and the negotiations on the Code of Conduct (COC) in the South China Sea, thus building the sea into a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation, he added.

Main	Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and President Jalal Talabani announced Monday that they plan to introduce a proposal that would allow thousands more former members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party to serve in the government.
Distant_Evaluation	The plan, if it were to gain approval, would be an important step toward reconciling Iraq's warring Shiites, who lead the government now, and Sunnis, who dominated the Hussein government.
Cause_Specific	The announcement by the prime minister's office came just hours after the outgoing American ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, gave his final news conference in which he repeatedly emphasized that the Iraqi government's slowness to change the draconian de-Baathification laws, among others, had contributed to American skepticism about Iraq's commitment to finding a political solution to the sectarian strife troubling the country.
Distant_Evaluation	The lack of movement had also hampered efforts at reconciliation between the Sunnis and Shiites, he said, since the Sunnis have had little faith that the Shiite government would do anything concrete to help them.
Distant_Historical	Changing the de-Baathification laws was one of the political goals for the Iraqi government set by the Bush administration six months ago.
Main	Under the proposal by the prime minister and the president, which comes on the heels of meetings held between Mr. Maliki and Sunni insurgent leaders and appears to be an effort to back up his outreach with action, all Baathists would be able to collect their pensions.
Main	In addition, thousands more former Baathists would be allowed to hold government jobs than under the current law.
Cause_General	Former Baathists who return to government work would have to sign a pledge that they would refrain from making political statements about the current government.
Cause_General	The law would also set a three-month time limit for Iraqi citizens who have complaints against former Baathists to bring a claim.
Cause_General	Then the courts would have six months to rule.
Cause_General	Any claims brought subsequently would be thrown out.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The goal of the new law is to take a step toward reconciling Sunnis and Shiites, said Dr. Sadiq al-Raqadi, a political adviser to Mr. Maliki.
Distant_Evaluation	''The reason for the new law is that the government wants to finish these cases; they want to close the files of the Baathists,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''This is an effort to find a solution for the problem of the Baathists.''
Distant_Evaluation	The Iraqi government's move, one of several aspects of reconciliation, comes not a moment too soon in Mr. Khalilzad's view.
Distant_Evaluation	''To sustain U.S. support, things have to move at a certain pace,'' Mr. Khalilzad said.
Distant_Evaluation	And, time is running out, he said.
Cause_Specific	The United States House of Representatives voted last week to begin withdrawing troops by the fall of 2008, and the Senate plans to consider a less restrictive plan, though it is unclear what the final outcome of the legislative effort will be.
Cause_General	Mr. Khalilzad served for 21 months in Iraq, during the drafting of the country's Constitution as well as the second nationwide election and a referendum approving the Constitution.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If, as expected, the United States Senate approves his nomination, he will become the American ambassador to the United Nations.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He will be replaced by Ryan Crocker, a career diplomat, who is currently the ambassador to Pakistan.
Distant_Evaluation	The Iraqi government's move to modify the de-Baathification law, if it goes through, would be a victory for Mr. Khalilzad who pushed hard to bring Sunnis back into the government.
Cause_General	Recently, American diplomats and military officials along with Iraqi government officials, including Mr. Maliki, have reached out to Sunni militants in an effort to woo those elements of the insurgency whom Mr. Khalilzad described as ''reconcilable insurgents'' and isolate the most violent elements.
Distant_Evaluation	''There is a real struggle going on in the Sunni Arab part of Iraq between those of Al Qaeda and the other more patriotic groups who want a successful Iraq, an Iraq in which everyone's rights is respected,'' said Mr. Khalilzad.
Distant_Evaluation	Most of these ''patriotic groups'' were linked to Mr. Hussein's former government rather than to the Sunni religious militants with ties to Al Qaeda.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Khalilzad underscored that there would be no discussions with individuals linked to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the insurgent group that claims ties to the Qaeda organization, which has been associated with some of the most destructive attacks in Iraq.
Cause_General	Mr. Khalilzad noted that in the six weeks since the American-backed security plan began, attacks had dropped 25 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	Baghdad seemed relatively quiet on Monday.
Cause_General	There were several improvised explosive devices that killed one Iraqi civilian and one policeman.
Cause_General	Fifteen unidentified bodies were found.
Distant_Anecdotal	National Public Radio on Monday reported an episode on Saturday in which gunmen opened fire on children playing soccer in Baghdad, followed by a battle between Sunni and Shiite neighbors.
Distant_Anecdotal	The details could not be verified on Monday.
Cause_General	In Hilla, south of Baghdad, three Sunni mosques were attacked, apparently in retribution for an attack on a Shiite mosque three days earlier.
Cause_General	In Iskandariya, American and Iraqi forces were attacked by insurgents hiding in a mosque who used rocket propelled grenades as well as guns.
Cause_General	The Iraqi soldiers entered the mosque and in the course of fighting injured two insurgents and killed one.
Cause_General	The American military also announced that it had captured the leaders of a major car bomb ring in Baghdad responsible for the deaths of more than 900 Iraqis.
Cause_General	Two suicide truck bombs exploded near Ramadi, but initial reports indicated they had killed only the drivers.

Error	(Xinhua/REUTERS)
Distant_Evaluation	WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- Ivanka Trump, the eldest daughter of U.S. President Donald Trump, has defended her use of a private email account while transitioning to a senior adviser in her father's administration.
Distant_Evaluation	"In an interview with ABC News broadcast Wednesday, Ivanka Trump said ""all of my emails are stored and preserved."
Distant_Evaluation	"There were no deletions,"" insisting that ""there's no connection between"" her situation and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's email scandal."
Main	The Washington Post reported this month that the president's daughter had used a private email account to conduct official government business, raising questions about the conformity with public records rules.
Distant_Evaluation	"""There is no restriction of using personal email,"" she said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""In fact, we're instructed that if we receive an email to our personal account that could relate to government work, you simply just forward it to your government account so it can be archived."""
Distant_Evaluation	"The U.S. president has defended his daughter's private email use, telling reporters at the White House last week that he looked at the matter and maintained that ""they're all in presidential records."""
Cause_General	The Presidential Records Act requires all official White House communications and records be preserved.
Distant_Historical	During her tenure as the top U.S. diplomat under former President Barack Obama, Clinton used her family's private email server for official communications.
Distant_Historical	The FBI found over 100 emails containing classified information on that server.
Distant_Historical	Clinton deleted thousands of emails that she and her lawyers decided were personal or unrelated to her government post.
Distant_Historical	She said she had been unaware of rules against using private email to conduct the public's business.
Distant_Historical	"The controversy was a major point of discussion during 2016 U.S. presidential election, when then Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump used the nickname ""Crooked Hillary"" to criticize Clinton, his Democratic rival, for her use of the private email server."
Distant_Historical	"Trump supporters used the chant ""lock her up"" to imply that Clinton had committed a crime."
Distant_Evaluation	"When asked by ABC News if the idea of ""lock her up!"""
Distant_Evaluation	"apply to herself, Ivanka Trump said ""no."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""My emails have not been deleted, nor was there anything of substance, nothing confidential that was within them."
Distant_Evaluation	"So, there's no connection between the two things,"" she added."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	U.S. lawmakers have planned to scrutinize Ivanka Trump's personal email use.
Cause_General	House Democrats have called on the White House to share more information about Ivanka Trump's email account and the nature of her messages.
Main	As the Senate opened debate Monday on a $122 billion Iraq spending bill, Republicans vowed not to allow Congress to impose a withdrawal date for American troops, but said they would rely on President Bush's veto pen rather than procedural maneuvers to block it.
Cause_Specific	Mr. Bush has vowed to veto any legislation that establishes a specific timetable to remove combat troops from Iraq.
Cause_General	The Democratic-led House has passed such a plan, and Senate Democratic leaders are seeking to advance a similar measure this week, but the party does not have enough votes in either chamber to override a veto.
Cause_General	For weeks, Republican leaders have used procedural maneuvers to delay a debate over Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said he did not want to hold up financing for the war by spending more time than necessary on a measure that will never become law.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Republicans signaled that they would not use procedural measures to block the bill, but would instead let the White House kill it and then urge Democrats to pass a bill that provides funding for the war without setting any dates for troop withdrawals.
Distant_Evaluation	''We need to get the bill on down to the president and get the veto out of the way,'' Senator McConnell said.
Cause_General	Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, played down the veto threat.
Distant_Evaluation	In a speech on the Senate floor on Monday, Mr. Reid said the president was on the wrong side of public opinion.
Distant_Evaluation	''He can swagger all he wants,'' Mr. Reid said, ''but we have 3,241 dead Americans.''
Cause_General	The Senate legislation, in addition to financing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the next six months, also would set a nonbinding goal of March 31, 2008, for most combat troops to be removed from Iraq.
Cause_General	The measure calls for a gradual redeployment of forces beginning in four months.
Distant_Evaluation	Several Republicans took to the Senate floor on Monday, criticizing Democrats for including about $20 billion for domestic programs in the spending request.
Distant_Evaluation	Senators were also considering attaching such issues as the minimum wage increase to the legislation.
Cause_General	The version that passed in the House last week included a long list of items not related to Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	''Really, what we have is a game of chicken between the House of Representatives that has larded up this appropriations bill with a lot of pork,'' said Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican.
Distant_Evaluation	The deliberations on Iraq, the latest in a string of debates between the House and Senate, opened against the backdrop of a nation looking for a new direction in Iraq.
Cause_General	Six in 10 Americans say they want Congress to support a troop withdrawal plan by August 2008, according to a Pew Research Center poll released Monday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said the legislation would force the administration to take a new course in Iraq, in addition to establishing a series of benchmarks for the Iraqi government.
Distant_Evaluation	He defended the domestic spending provisions in the bill, particularly drought assistance to farmers and resources to rebuild levees in Louisiana devastated by Hurricane Katrina.
Distant_Evaluation	''Funding for the war is not the only critical need worthy of supplemental funding this year,'' Mr. Byrd said.
Distant_Evaluation	''The war must not obliterate every other concern.''
Cause_General	Throughout several weeks of debate on Iraq, a majority of Democrats and Republicans have voted with their respective parties, creating little legislative progress in the Senate.
Cause_General	But Democrats have not been able to muster the votes they need to overcome legislative roadblocks by Republicans to proposals to set withdrawal dates.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The prospects of this week's Iraq debate remain uncertain.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Even after the Senate advances some type of spending bill, lawmakers will have to reconcile differences in the House version, most notably the withdrawal date, and draft a new proposal altogether if the president follows through with his veto pledge.
Distant_Evaluation	''I can't think of another conflict in which a deadline was set in the middle of the war that one side would withdraw from the conflict,'' said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the chairman of the Republican Conference.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's a heck of a way to fight a war.''
Distant_Evaluation	Several Republicans spoke on the Senate floor during the opening hours of debate on Monday, suggesting Democrats were abandoning the troops.
Cause_General	As he explained the bill, Mr. Byrd, the longest-serving member of the Senate, offered a full-throated defense.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''The bill before the Senate includes a provision that would give the war a new direction, and points the way out of the civil war in Iraq,'' Mr. Byrd said.
Distant_Evaluation	''There is no restriction on funding for the troops.''

Main	President Bush has chosen Fred F. Fielding as the new chief White House lawyer, adding to his team a longtime Washington legal hand and veteran of the post.
Distant_Historical	Mr.
Distant_Historical	Fielding forged his skills in politically charged episodes like Watergate and the air traffic controllers' strike in 1981.
Cause_Specific	White House officials said Mr. Bush would announce as early as Tuesday that Mr.
Cause_Specific	Fielding would return as White House counsel, succeeding Harriet E. Miers, who announced her resignation last week.
Cause_General	The officials insisted on anonymity to discuss an unannounced personnel decision.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding's agreement to take the job surprised some of his closest friends.
Distant_Evaluation	The friends said last week, when his name surfaced as a contender for the position, that they would be surprised if he would give up a successful corporate practice for another stint of what promises to be heavy partisan battle at age 67.
Distant_Historical	Mr.
Distant_Historical	Fielding was deputy counsel to President Richard M. Nixon under John W. Dean III and was White House counsel for the first five years of Ronald Reagan's presidency.
Cause_General	Since then, he has kept a hand in politics and government, helping screen job candidates for President Bush during and after his transition, and serving on the bipartisan Sept. 11 commission.
Distant_Evaluation	Several friends said they believed that he had been under heavy pressure to return as White House counsel by an administration girding for a raft of investigations by the new Democratic Congress.
Cause_General	The news of his selection was first reported on Monday afternoon on the Time magazine Web site.
Distant_Evaluation	Officials said Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding was always a leading candidate of the White House chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, who is said to have been seeking a possible change in the counsel's office from the moment he took over as chief of staff in April.
Distant_Evaluation	But several Republicans close to the White House said Mr. Bush swiftly dismissed that notion.
Cause_General	Ms. Miers had been Mr. Bush's lawyer in Texas and followed him here.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Bush nominated her to the Supreme Court in 2005, but she withdrew amid criticism of her qualifications.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Bolten pushed again for a new White House counsel after the Democrats won control of both chambers of Congress in November and he concluded that the president would need a more seasoned Washington creature in the months ahead, Republicans close to the administration said.
Distant_Evaluation	He found one in Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding, known as such an expert player of the inside game of Washington politics that he had even been suspected as Deep Throat, the confidential source of information who led to the disclosures of the Watergate scandal.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Fielding was not Deep Throat, but he is likely to bring a more sophisticated sense of the interplay among Congress, the news media and the White House than Ms. Miers.
Distant_Evaluation	The selection of such a battle-hardened hand as Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding for the counsel post underscores the degree to which the White House is girding for potentially intense battles with Democrats.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He would help prepare for the possibility that the new Congress may use hearings and, possibly, subpoenas to challenge Mr. Bush's broad assertions of executive power.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sounded a somewhat combative note.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''I'm hopeful that he will understand that the best way to represent his client is to cooperate when the Congress asks for information,'' Mr. Waxman said in a telephone interview.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding has a nuanced record on executive privilege and partisan confrontation.
Distant_Evaluation	Associates say he is as likely to head for the negotiating table as to the wrestling mat.
Distant_Evaluation	Lee H. Hamilton, the Democratic vice chairman of the Sept. 11 commission, said Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding had a major role in securing information and testimony from the White House that it was initially loathe to share.
Distant_Evaluation	''He understood the problems for the White House and he understood the demands of the commission,'' Mr. Hamilton said.
Distant_Evaluation	''He played a key role in working it out for us in an amicable way, and it didn't come easily.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In the counsel's position, Mr.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Fielding will lead a White House legal team that includes David S. Addington, the powerful chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney.
Cause_General	Both officials have advocated a tough line in protecting executive power against perceived intrusions by Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	A Republican close to the White House said Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding had maintained close ties to Mr. Cheney, whom he has known for decades, and had occasionally been an informal adviser to him.
Distant_Evaluation	J. Michael Luttig, a former federal judge who worked with Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding in the Reagan administration and remains close to him, said:
Distant_Evaluation	''He has a firm, clear view of executive prerogative, but he also understands as well as anyone in Washington the constitutional need for compromise.
Distant_Evaluation	He is not someone that takes an absolutist position and then drives the presidency and the branches together off the brink.
Distant_Evaluation	He has judgment.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Luttig said Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding had wrestled somewhat with the decision to become White House counsel, but ultimately, ''He did this out of a sense of obligation and patriotism, and that was the sole reason.''
Distant_Evaluation	Republicans close to the White House said Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding had assurances of having a wide berth that he apparently received last week in a meeting with Mr. Bush.
Distant_Evaluation	Kenneth M. Duberstein, a chief of staff for Mr. Reagan, said because Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding had been an aide to two presidents he would not be cowed by the Oval Office or so charmed by the president that he would shy from giving potentially unwelcome advice.
Distant_Evaluation	''Fred has an independence of judgment and independence of stature,'' Mr. Duberstein said.
Distant_Evaluation	''He knows how to deliver tough news.''
Distant_Evaluation	All the same, Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding is clearly being brought in to draw legal lines in the sand.
Distant_Evaluation	''He brings enormous credibility to both sides, but he's the president's counsel,'' said Wayne Berman, a Republican lobbyist who is friendly with Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Fielding and whose wife is the White House social secretary, Lea Berman.
Distant_Evaluation	''He's not there to represent the views of the Congress.''

Main	Three Republican senators voiced fresh concerns on Sunday about Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales's handling of the dismissals of eight United States attorneys amid questions about whether the firings were politically motivated.
Main	The comments, made in separate televised interviews by Republicans with histories of breaking with the White House, provided further indication of waning support for Mr. Gonzales where he needs it most, among fellow Republicans.
Cause_Specific	Questions over Mr. Gonzales's future intensified on both sides of the aisle this weekend, after the release of Justice Department documents late Friday that detailed plans for a meeting between Mr. Gonzales and his aides in which they discussed the dismissals last year, 10 days before most of them happened.
Cause_General	Mr. Gonzales had previously said that he was ''not involved in any discussions about what was going on'' and that he had mostly followed the process from a distance.
Main	Speaking on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said he spoke with Mr. Gonzales on Saturday and told him ''he was going to have to have an explanation as to why he said he wasn't involved in discussions -- that's the key word -- and now you have these e-mails which appear to contradict that.''
Distant_Evaluation	White House officials continued to defend Mr. Gonzales, saying the e-mail messages did not directly contradict anything he had said and noting that he had not disputed that at the end of the process he signed off on the final list of prosecutors to be dismissed.
Distant_Evaluation	President Bush said in his Saturday radio address that he strongly supported Mr. Gonzales in the decision to oust the prosecutors, though he has said he believes that more explanation is necessary.
Main	Mr. Specter said Sunday that he would withhold judgment until he could learn more about the dismissals in Congressional testimony from Mr. Gonzales and others.
Main	But he added: ''We have to have an attorney general who is candid, truthful.
Main	And if we find he has not been candid and truthful, that's a very compelling reason for him not to stay on.''
Cause_General	Mr. Specter, who has split with the administration on issues including domestic spying and the legal rights of terror suspects, is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Main	Speaking on ''This Week'' on ABC, Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, said of Mr. Gonzales, ''He does have a credibility problem,'' adding, ''I think he's going to have some difficulties.''
Main	Asked by the host, George Stephanopoulos, whether Mr. Gonzales could serve effectively given the questions about his credibility, Mr. Hagel responded, ''Well, I do not, and I think the president is going to have to make a tough choice here.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Hagel has been a major Republican critic of Mr. Bush's handling of the Iraq war and is a potential 2008 presidential candidate.
Main	Senator Lindsay Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS, ''I really do like Attorney General Gonzales, but he has been wounded.''
Main	Mr. Graham added: ''He's going to have to come to the Senate and re-establish his credibility.
Main	He's going to have to prove to us that there was a legitimate reason this was poorly handled.''
Cause_General	All three senators broke with the White House over conditions for possible Congressional interviews in the matter with White House aides, including Karl Rove, the president's top political adviser, and Harriet E. Miers, the former White House counsel.
Cause_General	The president has offered to allow the aides to sit for private interviews with Congress if the sessions are not transcribed or conducted under oath.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Graham, Mr. Hagel and Mr. Specter said the interviews should at least be transcribed for the sake of accuracy and transparency.
Cause_General	On Sunday, the White House found its strongest Republican defender in a onetime adversary, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican whip.
Distant_Evaluation	In an interview on ''Fox News Sunday,'' Mr. Lott mocked the Democrats for charging that politics were involved in decisions involving political appointees.
Distant_Evaluation	''The horrors of horrors -- my goodness,'' Mr. Lott said.
Distant_Evaluation	''How were they selected in the first place?''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Lott also defended Mr. Bush's decision to invoke executive privilege in refusing to provide his aides for sworn testimony before Congress, saying ''he'd be making a huge mistake'' if he decided otherwise.
Cause_General	Later Sunday, the Democratic National Committee provided a list of quotations from Mr. Lott criticizing former President Bill Clinton for invoking executive privilege during the investigation into his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, including one in 1998 in which Mr. Lott called it improper and said, ''It looks like they are hiding something.''
Distant_Evaluation	Also on Sunday, in an interview on ''Late Edition'' on CNN, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and a member of the Judiciary Committee, defended the terms under which Mr. Bush said his aides could be interviewed and said he still had full confidence in Mr. Gonzales.
Distant_Evaluation	And on ''Fox News Sunday,'' Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, who initially held off from calling for Mr. Gonzales's resignation, said: ''I believe he should step down.
Distant_Evaluation	And I don't like saying this.
Distant_Evaluation	This is not my natural personality at all.
Distant_Evaluation	But I think the nation is not well-served by this.''

Main	WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- As the ongoing investigation of the Saudi journalist's death continued to perplex the world, U.S. experts say the incident is unlikely to lead to a fundamental change for the U.S.-Saudi ties.
Cause_Specific	Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for Washington Post, has not been seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Cause_Specific	Riyadh admitted that the 59-year-old was killed inside the consulate and 18 people were arrested over their alleged connections to the killing afterward.
Distant_Evaluation	"In its latest public statement, the White House said on Monday that the Trump administration ""is weighing different options"" in response to the case and will make an announcement later."
Distant_Evaluation	Since the disclosure of Khashoggi's murder, Washington has criticized the Saudi authorities for its handling of the case while President Donald Trump himself showed certain restraint on vocal attack against Riyadh.
Distant_Evaluation	Trump and his senior advisor Jared Kushner are key strong supporters of the Saudis while others may hold a different view, Darrell West, a Brookings Institution Senior Fellow, told Xinhua.
Cause_General	U.S. Congress soured on alliance with Riyadh following the case, calling for sanctions and a ban of arms sales to the kingdom.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Obviously we're going through a period of tension and uncertainty and strain,"" said David Pollock, a scholar at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy."
Distant_Evaluation	"For Ford O'Connell , a Republican strategist and TV personality, Washington has to ""make a stand here."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""The rest of the world is watching."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"And if he (Trump) doesn't take some sort of proportional action, it's going to send a message to the rest of the Arab world,"" O'Connell told Xinhua."
Distant_Evaluation	"Pollock observed that there were already some ""symbols"" demonstrating America's disapproval of what happened to Khashoggi, including some individual sanctions and cancellation of some official meetings."
Cause_General	The U.S. State Department announced last week that it was revoking visas of Saudi officials suspected of involvement in the death of Khashoggi, a first concrete step of punishment taken by the U.S. government.
Distant_Evaluation	But the move has been criticized as quite symbolic and bearing little practical consequence.
Distant_Evaluation	"""On the whole, I think the administration seems pretty set on maintaining the basic elements of this relationship,"" Pollock told Xinhua."
Distant_Evaluation	Wayne White, a former U.S. State Department official, shared a similar view.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""President Trump likely still hopes to get past the Khashoggi affair without serious damage to the U.S.-Saudi relationship,"" he said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Experts believe that the vital role Riyadh plays in Washington's comprehensive strategy of containing Iran would make the Trump administration reluctant to distance itself from the ally.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Any U.S. plans to confront Iran forcefully depend heavily on Saudi Arabia for basing, refueling, overflight rights, among others,"" noted White, who once served as deputy director of the Middle East Intelligence Office of the State Department."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""The change in atmosphere (regarding U.S.-Saudi ties) is going to add another layer of complexity to the U.S. government's effort to contain and isolate and counter Iran, but it's not going to change the basic approach,"" Pollack said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""As a result of the murder and cover-up, it will be harder to use Saudi Arabia to pursue American interests in the Middle East,"" noted West."

Cause_General	Lebanese elections have never seen this many independent candidates, with dozens from outside the parties that dominate the country.
Cause_General	They stand against a political elite which has barely changed since the 1975-90 civil war.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They hope a new voting system will help them unseat at least some of the old guard, and want to tap into anger that fueled a wave of anti-government protests in 2015.
Distant_Evaluation	“Their failure is our chance,” said Gilbert Doumit, who is running in Beirut against the incumbent Nadim Gemayel, the son of one of Lebanon’s most prominent war leaders.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We want to get our causes into the parliament.”
Cause_General	The old order, built on powerful families and past militia chiefs, has sought to regenerate itself again ahead of this election, with fathers making way for sons or relatives.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The newcomers face massive hurdles in the parliamentary contest and could win a handful of seats at best.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Yet even that would mark a first.
Distant_Evaluation	They believe it is time to build on public despair, which sparked the 2015 protest movement when piles of trash festered in the streets for months.
Distant_Evaluation	The garbage symbolized a corrupt power-sharing system unable to meet basic needs, and later helped Beirut activists do surprisingly well in municipal polls, though they did not win.
Distant_Evaluation	AN UPHILL STRUGGLE
Distant_Evaluation	“No doubt, change will not happen in 24 hours, but the elections are one of the main stops,” said Doumit, 42, a consultant who has been pounding the streets of mainly Christian east Beirut for weeks.
Cause_General	He is contesting a seat reserved for a Maronite Christian in an assembly which parcels out 128 seats among the many religious sects.
Cause_General	Doumit is part of the wide coalition of 66 candidates in nine electoral districts.
Cause_General	Smaller blocs are also vowing to fight the establishment across the 15 total districts.
Cause_General	Some have worked for years to remedy the state’s failures.
Cause_General	Others rose to prominence after the trash crisis, or came from local fame like talk show host Paula Yaacoubian.
Cause_General	But Doumit’s district was long a stronghold of the Gemayel family and their Kateab party, which was founded by Nadim’s grandfather in 1936 and is now led by his cousin Sami.
Distant_Historical	Nadim’s father, Bashir Gemayel, was assassinated in Beirut after being elected president during Israel’s 1982 invasion.
Cause_General	Images of his father cover the walls of his offices.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Gemayel, who is expected to keep the votes of big families with old Kateab ties, has also tried to target young voters.
Distant_Evaluation	The new faces have a shot as people want alternatives, but their politics falls short, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	They lack united or clear stances, including on critical issues like the powerful arsenal of Iran-backed Shi’ite Hezbollah, he added.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Soon, civil society will enter parliament,” he said of the independents.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“They will not be able to achieve anything more than (we) did.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They will have to share in the establishment.”
Distant_Evaluation	He said he does not view himself as a political heir but sees nothing wrong with them if they serve Lebanon.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	PASSING ON THE BATON
Distant_Historical	Gemayel, 35, became an MP in 2009 when his mother, Solange, made way for him.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Outside Beirut, this election will see other establishment families pass on the baton.
Cause_General	Druze leader Walid Jumblatt and Maronite politician Suleiman Franjieh are stepping aside for their sons.
Cause_General	President Michel Aoun’s two son-in-laws are battling for Maronite seats.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The new proportional law has replaced a winner-takes-all system, scrambling alliances among the ruling parties.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Critics say the law was still crafted to suit traditional heavyweights, although it may open the door for new faces.
Distant_Evaluation	Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said the protest movements after 2015 had failed to produce real political powers that can challenge the old order.
Distant_Evaluation	Long-time activists accuse some independents of allying with officials close to the establishment to boost their chances.

Distant_Evaluation	First-timers do not enjoy a level playing field.
Distant_Evaluation	Incumbent parties wield patronage, handing out government jobs, own hospitals and TV stations, or receive regional funding, he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In the Beirut district where Doumit and Gemayel face off, all is not lost for independents, partly because its relatively well-off electorate can afford to reject the establishment.
Distant_Evaluation	For the working class though, “their lifeline passes through the traditional parties,” Hage Ali said.
Distant_Evaluation	Anyone who wants to contest the elite has to offer viable alternatives.
Distant_Evaluation	“This is where the real competition is, these are the people.”
Main	The new Democratic majority in Congress is divided over how to assert its power in opposing President Bush's plan to send more troops to Baghdad, as leaders explore ways to block financing for a military expansion without being accused of abandoning American forces already in Iraq.
Main	While Democrats find themselves unusually united in their resistance to a troop increase, party leaders are locked in an internal debate over how far to go in objecting to the administration's Iraq strategy.
Cause_General	The White House has invited some Democrats to meet with Mr. Bush before he gives his Iraq speech on Wednesday, even as others have scoured the history books to find cases when Congress has reined in the commander in chief.
Cause_Specific	In the most aggressive of the new tactics, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, has said he will introduce legislation on Tuesday to require the president to gain new Congressional authority before sending more troops to Iraq.
Cause_General	The bill is the first proposal in the Senate that would prohibit paying for an increase in American troops over their level on Jan. 1.
Distant_Evaluation	''Is there any American in this country who thinks the United States Senate would vote to support sending American troops into a civil war in Iraq today?''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Kennedy said Monday in an interview.
Distant_Evaluation	''Is there any American that believes this?
Distant_Evaluation	I don't think so, but that is what's happening, and we have to do everything we can to insist on accountability.''
Cause_General	The Kennedy plan is intended to provide Democrats with a road map for how to proceed in Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Kennedy, as he begins his 45th year in the Senate, recalled that Congress interceded during conflicts in Vietnam and Lebanon, and he said Democrats should not hesitate to do so in Iraq.
Cause_Specific	The new House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, has similarly suggested that Democrats consider blocking financing for a troop increase, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, vowed Monday ''to take a look at it.''
Cause_Specific	But the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, has not endorsed the idea.
Cause_Specific	Other Democrats, either looking ahead to a possible presidential candidacy or their own re-elections, have also distanced themselves from such a proposal, fearful of being cast as opposing the troops.
Distant_Evaluation	''I don't think we should be pulling back any funds,'' said Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who was elected in November.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	She said she would oppose a proposal to block money for a troop increase.
Cause_General	The Democratic Party sailed to victory in midterm elections in the fall on a promise to change course in Iraq.
Cause_General	Still, there is little consensus over how to proceed.
Cause_Specific	Some Democrats are urging an immediate withdrawal of troops and a drastic reduction in war spending.
Cause_Specific	Others are calling for a gradual re-deployment of troops to move them out of Iraq.
Cause_Specific	Still other Democrats are waiting for Mr. Bush to present his plan before criticizing it.
Distant_Evaluation	The expectations set by the elections, Democrats say, present a complicating challenge as they begin to govern.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Take, for example, Mr. Reid, who said on Dec. 17 that he would support a plan for a temporary increase in increase troops.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Two weeks later, he announced his opposition, saying his change had nothing to do with other Democratic senators having spoken out against it, but rather with military officials having disagreed with a call for more troops.
Distant_Evaluation	Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said he believed that his party lost the White House in 2004 because of Iraq.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''My concern now is that too many Democrats are going to want to play it safe on this issue and not take the strong stand that American people demand,'' he said Monday.
Distant_Evaluation	The pressure from war critics on the Democratic left has been particularly intense.
Distant_Evaluation	''The bottom line is that they were elected on a mandate to get the nation out of the mess in Iraq,'' said Eli Pariser, the executive director of MoveOn.org, a liberal political action committee.
Cause_General	By law, Congress can limit the nature of troop deployments, cap the size of military deployments and cut financing for existing or prospective deployments.
Cause_General	Since 1970, there have been dozens of occasions in which Congress has tried to step into military action, from Haiti to Bosnia to Kosovo, according to a memorandum being sent Tuesday to lawmakers by the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Representative Adam Smith of Washington, vice chairman of the moderate New Democratic Coalition, said he feared that withholding financing -- even for new troops being sent to Iraq -- could have a detrimental effect on all forces.
Distant_Evaluation	''I don't want our troops to be caught between the president and Congress in a political fight,'' said Mr. Smith, who was to receive a briefing on Tuesday at the White House.
Distant_Evaluation	''If there are any risks that our efforts to slash the budget would place them at greater risk, that would be unacceptable to me.''
Distant_Evaluation	But Democrats who are trying to stop Mr. Bush's proposed troop increase, a group led by Mr. Kennedy, say their proposal to block financing will apply only to new troops.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Kennedy said he hoped that his legislation would be urgently considered by the full Senate, but acknowledged that it remained an open question whether his Democratic leaders would schedule it for a quick vote.
Distant_Evaluation	''The importance of this legislation is that it will apply now before we could get the escalation,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''If you wait, this thing is going to be past.
Distant_Evaluation	I'm not sure that all of our colleagues in the Senate understand that, quite frankly.''

Main	SANAA, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States has been mounting pressure to bring an end to the war in Yemen that is pitting its close allies in the Saudi-led coalition against Iranian-allied Shiite Houthi rebels.
Distant_Evaluation	After more than three years of devastating war that killed thousands and brought the whole Yemeni nation to the brink of starvation, why is the United States stepping up its pressures now?
Main	"The U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis has called for ""immediate end"" to the war in Yemen."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""It looks like very, very early in December up in Sweden we'll see both the Houthi rebel side and the Saudi-backed government of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi will be up there,"" Mattis told reporters at the Pentagon last week."
Cause_General	Mattis' words were quickly backed by the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Cause_General	In the U.S. Congress, many senators have risen their voices to end the U.S. military support to Saudi Arabia, increasing pressure on Trump administration to end the war in Yemen.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They are now preparing to pass a legislation to completely end the U.S. military assistance to Saudi Arabia.
Cause_General	Also, many European countries, including France, have backed the calls for ending the conflict in Yemen.
Cause_General	Some European governments announced a pause of their weapon sales to Saudi Arabia.
Cause_General	Britain sent its Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to Riyadh to press for an end to the Yemen's war.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Now, after such unprecedented push, the United Nations is well confident that all rival parties to the conflict will engage in those upcoming peace process.
Distant_Evaluation	These accelerating moves are raising a question, why now?
Distant_Evaluation	"""The U.S. diplomatic movements have begun in early October, after the Western media began to learn about details of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,"" said Abdelelah Haidar, a Yemeni political analyst and an expert on the U.S. political issues based in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia."
Cause_Specific	Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident, who was a journalist for The Washington Post, was reportedly assassinated inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Cause_Specific	The Saudi government has since been facing increasing pressure to disclose the perpetrators behind the murder of Khashoggi, as well as to end its war in Yemen.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It appeared to be a U.S. military decision by the Pentagon chief Mattis as he was the first U.S. official to demand an immediate end to the Saudi-led coalition war in Yemen,"" Haidar told Xinhua."
Cause_General	Before Mattis' move, many voices in the Congress, which are very critical to the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, have increasingly demanded the punishment against the murders of Khashoggi and called for an end to the Yemen's war.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The victory of democrats in the midterm elections in the Congress in late October has sped up the pressure on Trump's administration,"" Haidar said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""The democratic's senators were backed by a large-scale support from the leading U.S. media outlets, which focused on the Saudi-led coalition war in Yemen and linked it with the murder of Khashoggi,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""I think, the Congress' pressure is targeting Trump himself ... it targeted the personal business relationship between Trump, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and the Saudi royal family,"" Haidar said."
Distant_Evaluation	"Analyst Adel al-Assar of Sanaa-based daily Althawra newspaper said that ""all comes together, the Congress' actions and U.S. media reports on Yemen's war, to put Trump administration to do something."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""The democrats in the Congress are preparing to move ahead toward a complete cut of the U.S. military assistance to Saudi Arabia,"" al-Assar said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""So, Trump and Kushner have their own personal motive to save Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom they have a very special friendship,"" he added."
Distant_Evaluation	"The Congress' movements and Trump's ""personal motivation"" are two important factors that could probably explain what was behind the U.S. quick action towards its close ally Saudi Arabia and the war of Yemen."
Distant_Evaluation	The same movements could also be seen recently in the discussions inside the British House of Commons and the House of Lords, which focused on Khashoggi's murder and the war in Yemen.
Distant_Evaluation	Professor Ali al-Ammary of the Faculty of Media in Sanaa University argued that the increasing pictures of Yemen's war, particularly the airstrikes, the Yemeni malnourished children and depressed Yemeni families on western media front pages, were the key factor behind the recent international pressure to end the war.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The peoples in the U.S. and Europe have become aware that millions of Yemeni children are dying from malnutrition, starvation and epidemic diseases as a result from the Saudi-led coalition naval blockade for more than three years,"" said al-Ammary."
Distant_Evaluation	"It was an ""ignored war"" for many months because many western journalists had been denied access to Yemen, by now the international media organizations have become more active in reporting daily tragedies of millions of Yemenis."
Distant_Evaluation	"""It has become facts that are shown by international media outlets, newspapers and televisions on a daily basis, and that put pressure on the U.S. and Britain to take an action now to stop this conflict,"" al-Ammary said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""I think it's the right moment to push for the Yemen peace, which represents all the best opportunity to date,"" he added."

Distant_Historical	President Francisco Guterres dissolved parliament in January after former Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri’s minority government faced a legislative stalemate.
Distant_Historical	De Vasconcelos, known as Taur Matan Ruak, which means Two Sharp Eyes, is a former president.
Cause_General	He belongs to a three-party coalition, the Alliance of Change for Progress (AMP), that won 34 of the 65 seats up for grabs in May’s parliamentary election, the fifth since independence from Indonesia in 2002.
Main	During his swearing-in at a restored presidential palace built during Portuguese colonial rule, he promised to “dedicate all my energies and knowledge to the defense and consolidation of independence and national unity”.
Cause_General	But illustrating challenges to forming a stable new government, Guterres a day earlier had rejected eight of the ministers put forward by Ruak because of corruption investigations.
Distant_Historical	A 2017 parliamentary election produced no clear winner, with Alkatiri’s Fretilin party winning just 0.2 percent more votes than CNRT, and forming a minority government in the country of 1.2 million people.
Distant_Evaluation	Guterres said the political deadlock had created “fear and uncertainty” and the new government needed to use its mandate to “boost national development, living conditions in the communities throughout the country and develop our economy”.
Distant_Evaluation	Asia’s youngest democracy has been largely peaceful in recent years following recurrent bouts of political instability that it suffered since independence.
Distant_Evaluation	But it has struggled to reduce poverty, stamp out corruption and develop its rich oil and gas resources.
Distant_Historical	The energy sector made up about 60 percent of gross domestic product in 2014 and more than 90 percent of government revenue.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Ruak said his new government would improve equality and develop the economy so it does not “just rely on interest from the petroleum fund”.
Cause_General	The AMP coalition includes the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction (CNRT) party of independence hero Xanana Gusmao.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Gusmao, the country’s first president and a former prime minister, is expected to be take up a special ministerial post to advise Ruak, an AMP official has said.

Main	VIENNA (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin blamed political ructions in the United States for difficulties in arranging a summit with President Donald Trump, in remarks broadcast on Monday.
Distant_Historical	Trump said in March the two leaders would meet soon.
Cause_General	But since then already fragile ties between Washington and Moscow have been strained further by the conflict in Syria and the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain.
Distant_Evaluation	Putin said last month the proposed summit was beset by problems and was not working out for now.
Main	Asked by Austrian broadcaster ORF why it was taking so long to arrange, he said: “You have to ask our colleagues in the USA.
Main	In my view it is the consequence of the fierce domestic political contest in the United States.”
Cause_General	Putin, who gave ORF an interview ahead of a visit to Austria on Tuesday, did not elaborate.
Cause_General	Trump is under pressure from special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into whether Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion with Trump’s campaign - something both he and Moscow deny.
Cause_General	“In one of our last discussions, Donald said he is concerned about the danger of a new arms race.
Distant_Evaluation	I agree with him entirely,” Putin said in a short extract released ahead of the full interview, to be broadcast on Monday evening.
Distant_Historical	Apart from mentioning the U.S. withdrawal in 2002 from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, Putin did not elaborate.
Distant_Evaluation	Trump made a similarly vague reference to the issue in April, when he said “Stop the arms race?” in a tweet that also mentioned providing “help” for the Russian economy.

Error	(Xinhua/Hu Yousong)
Main	WASHINGTON, Nov. 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday affirmed Washington's commitment to its partnership with Riyadh citing national interests, remaining an ambiguous attitude toward the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Main	"""The United States intends to remain a steadfast partner of Saudi Arabia to ensure the interests of our country, Israel and all other partners in the region,"" Trump said in a statement released by the White House."
Cause_General	"Calling Saudi Arabia a ""great ally"" in U.S. fight against Iran, Trump emphasized Riyadh's estimated 450-billion-U.S.-dollar investment in the United States following his trip last year, including expected 110 billion dollars' spending on arms purchase from major U.S. companies."
Distant_Evaluation	Meanwhile, the White House host avoided making judgment on the alleged Saudi royal family's involvement in the recent killing of Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, which has stirred up the international community and invites criticism to the Middle East kingdom.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Our intelligence agencies continue to assess all information, but it could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event -- maybe he did and maybe he didn't!"""
Distant_Evaluation	Trump noted.
Distant_Evaluation	U.S. media, citing insiders, reported last week that the CIA had concluded the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered to kill Khashoggi, while the crown prince himself kept denying the accusations.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We now know many details of this horrible crime,"" said Trump in the statement, adding that ""we may never know all of the facts surrounding the murder of Mr. Jamal Khashoggi."""
Distant_Evaluation	Trump also revealed that he acknowledged the intention of many U.S. Congress members, who were seeking tough punishment on Saudi Arabia over the Khashoggi incident, but indicated little willingness to echo their call.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""I will consider whatever ideas are presented to me, but only if they are consistent with the absolute security and safety of America,"" Trump noted."
Cause_Specific	Khashoggi has been missing since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Cause_Specific	"The Saudi authorities had said Khashoggi died in a ""brawl"" in its consulate."
Cause_Specific	After releasing the results of its initial investigation, the Saudi Public Prosecution announced that 18 people were arrested for their alleged connections with the killing.
Cause_Specific	U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on 17 individuals over their alleged roles in the killing of Khashoggi last week, following U.S. State Department's decision in late October to revoke 21 Saudi suspects' visas.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	U.S. Congress has urged a thorough investigation of the case, and threatened to take more actions against Saudi Arabia if those responsible were not held accountable, such as suspending U.S. military sales.
Main	With both houses of Congress now firmly on record in favor of withdrawing from Iraq, President Bush vowed Wednesday not to negotiate a timetable with Democrats, and a confrontation appeared inevitable as each side prepared to blame the other for delays in providing money for the war.
Main	''Now, some of them believe that by delaying funding for our troops, they can force me to accept restrictions on our commanders that I believe would make withdrawal and defeat more likely,'' Mr. Bush told an audience of cattlemen and ranchers.
Main	''That's not going to happen.
Main	If Congress fails to pass a bill to fund our troops on the front lines, the American people will know who to hold responsible.''
Cause_General	Mr. Bush and Congressional Democrats are already deadlocked over the Democrats' demands for testimony from top White House officials in an inquiry into the firing of federal prosecutors.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The president's remarks on Wednesday, a day after the Senate voted for the first time in favor of setting a withdrawal date, set the stage for a second clash.
Distant_Evaluation	That puts Mr. Bush in the difficult position of fighting the new Democratic majority on two fronts, both the war spending and the prosecutors.
Distant_Evaluation	On Wednesday, he seemed in no mood to back down from the war spending fight.
Distant_Evaluation	As he quoted a newspaper editorial -- from The Los Angeles Times, though he did not mention it by name -- accusing Democrats of ''the worst kind of Congressional meddling in military strategy,'' Mr. Bush appeared almost eager for a battle.
Distant_Evaluation	And Democrats seemed eager to give it to him.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House speaker, said Mr. Bush should ''calm down with the threats,'' and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said his impression was that Mr. Bush ''doesn't want anything other than a confrontation.''
Cause_General	The president has been saying for weeks that he will veto any war spending bill that contains a withdrawal date.
Cause_General	He reiterated that threat on Wednesday, taking particular aim at Democrats for loading the military spending bills with unrelated special interest projects above the $100 billion he has asked for the war, including $3.5 million for visitors to ''tour the Capitol and see for themselves how Congress works,'' and $6.4 million for the House of Representatives' ''salaries and expense accounts.''
Main	''I don't know what that is,'' Mr. Bush said wryly, ''but it's not related to the war and protecting the United States of America.''
Cause_General	The House approved its version of the spending bill last week, and the Senate was expected to approve its version on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	Democrats said they were ready to begin House-Senate negotiations quickly to produce a final version to send to the president.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But with Congress scheduled to begin its Easter recess on Friday, it is nearly impossible for lawmakers to produce a final bill before the week of April 16.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With Mr. Bush warning that funds will run out on April 15, forcing the Pentagon to draw from other accounts, the two sides seem certain to wind up in a blame game over who is responsible for holding up the money.
Distant_Evaluation	The Democratic leaders, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid, tried to strike a conciliatory tone, stressing that they would deliver all the money Mr. Bush requested.
Distant_Evaluation	In a joint letter to the president, they said they stood ready to work with the White House.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''But your threats to veto a bill that has not even been presented to you indicate that you may not be ready to work with us,'' the letter said.
Distant_Evaluation	While they are hoping to capitalize on Mr. Bush's unpopularity, Democrats acknowledged privately that they were uncertain how the finger-pointing would play out.
Distant_Historical	Some recalled President Clinton's success in putting the blame on Republicans for a 1995 government shutdown.
Distant_Evaluation	Republicans say Mr. Bush may be unpopular, but his policy of sending additional troops to Iraq may have more support than he does.
Distant_Evaluation	Despite a recent nationwide telephone poll by the Pew Research Center for People and the Press in which 59 percent of those who responded said they wanted their lawmakers to vote in favor of a timetable for withdrawal, aides to Mr. Bush say the public is beginning to see improvements on the ground in Iraq and is willing to give Mr. Bush's troop buildup a chance.
Distant_Evaluation	''We hope it doesn't have to come to this type of brinksmanship, staring down the Congress, but as you saw today the president feels very strongly,'' said Dan Bartlett, counselor to Mr. Bush.
Distant_Evaluation	''The feedback we've been getting from our allies on the Hill -- and we agree with them -- is that this is an issue we shouldn't shirk from.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Democratic officials say the shape of the measure that will be sent to the president remains unclear, but it is almost certain to have some timeline on Iraq, given the votes in both houses.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But Democrats also say they intend to pare down some of the nonwar spending in the bill to quiet Republican accusations of pork-barrel politics.
Distant_Evaluation	Democrats also acknowledge that even with the unpopularity of the war, they must move carefully.
Cause_General	The House bill passed with just 218 votes, the minimum necessary to guarantee passage, and in the Senate, the provision to set a goal of pulling out by March 31, 2008, also passed narrowly, 50 to 48.
Distant_Evaluation	''The president does have leverage on the troops, and given the close votes, we have to be cognizant of that,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic caucus.
Distant_Evaluation	''But we have leverage on the policy and he has to be cognizant of that.''
Distant_Evaluation	Republicans say Mr. Bush must move carefully as well.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Charlie Black, a Republican strategist who is close to the White House, said the administration could win the argument with the public ''if they handle it right and communicate it well.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Republican leaders say they will back Mr. Bush as he tries to make the case to the public that Congress does not have the power to dictate the management of the war.
Cause_General	''We have a constitutional republic that says the commander in chief of our forces is the president,'' said Senator Mel Martinez, the Florida Republican who is also chairman of the Republican National Committee.
Distant_Evaluation	''It gives the power of the purse to Congress; it doesn't give the power of moving troops around to Congress.''

Main	TOKYO, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- The Naha branch of the Fukuoka High Court in Japan on Wednesday rejected demands from the Okinawa prefectural government to halt the relocation of a controversial U.S. base within Japan's southernmost prefecture despite calls from local officials and residents for the base to be moved off the island.
Cause_Specific	The Okinawa prefectural government's appeal for the suspension of work for the relocation of the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from the crowded residential area of Ginowan to the less populated Henoko coastal district in Nago, both in Okinawa, was dismissed by a lower court with the ruling upheld by the high court on Wednesday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The central government now plans to restart landfill work in earnest on Dec. 14 for the construction of the new U.S. replacement military facility, despite the local government highlighting the fact that documents necessary for temporarily storing soil and sand near the construction site had not been submitted.
Cause_General	Okinawa hosts the bulk of U.S. military facilities in Japan, yet the tiny sub-tropical island accounts for just a small fraction of Japan's total landmass.
Distant_Evaluation	As well as shouldering the majority of U.S. bases and being victims of U.S. base-linked workers' criminal activities, which span rape and murder, to driving under the influence of alcohol, as well as a steady flow of accidents and mishaps involving U.S. military aircraft, the new location for the base has an extremely delicate ecosystem unique to Okinawa that the locals desperately want to protect.
Cause_General	The overall plans for the new base involve 157 hectares of land being reclaimed from pristine waters off the Henoko area and the building of a V-shaped runway.
Distant_Historical	The plans stem from a pact made between the United States and Japan in 1996, with Henoko being selected as the replacement site in 1999.
Cause_General	The local and central governments have been at odds over the relocation of the base since 1999, with Denny Tamaki, who became Okinawa governor in October following the death of his predecessor Governor Takeshi Onaga, urging the central government to reduce Okinawa's disproportionate base-hosting burdens and shift the new base off the island.
Distant_Evaluation	WEST ORANGE, N.J./NORTH AVONDALE, Ohio (Reuters) - Aftab Pureval, a Democrat seeking to unseat a Republican congressman in Ohio, knows the political risks in calling for gun restrictions – and taking on the powerful National Rifle Association, which has spent more than $115,000 supporting his opponent over the years.
Cause_Specific	But after a spate of school shootings, including February’s massacre at a high school in Parkland, Florida, Pureval believes voters in the Republican-leaning district have had enough of congressional inaction.
Distant_Evaluation	“The leaders that they sent to Washington, D.C., to represent them have had their opportunity time and time again – and time and time again, they have failed,” Pureval, 35, said after a rally with gun-safety activist and former congresswoman Gabby Giffords, who suffered brain damage from a gunshot in 2011.
Cause_General	A Reuters analysis shows Pureval is among Democrats in the most competitive U.S. congressional races who have embraced gun control in far greater numbers than in 2016, defying the conventional wisdom that doing so is a losing proposition in close contests.
Cause_General	Thirty-eight of the 59 Democrats backed by the party’s “Red-to-Blue” campaign – targeting vulnerable Republican districts – have supported gun restrictions in their official platforms, a review of campaign websites shows.
Cause_General	Several others separately released statements calling for limits.
Distant_Historical	At this point in the 2016 election cycle, only four of 36 Red-to-Blue candidates backed gun limits in their platforms, according to a Reuters review of archived campaign websites.
Distant_Historical	Reuters was unable to examine the websites for two candidates in the program that year.
Main	November’s midterm elections will test whether gun violence has become a defining issue for U.S. voters in the wake of the Parkland shooting that killed 17 students and staff and reignited a nationwide movement for stricter gun laws after a campaign by student survivors.
Cause_General	Nearly all the Democrats in the three dozen most competitive races for the U.S. House of Representatives wrote multiple social media posts touting their support for anti-gun legislation and for the student-led protest, according to a Reuters review of their postings.
Distant_Evaluation	But many Democrats have modulated their message, avoiding inflammatory terms such as “gun control” and voicing support for basic gun rights with “common-sense” reforms.
Distant_Evaluation	Political risks remain.
Distant_Evaluation	In past cycles, advocates for gun safety struggled to match the might of the National Rifle Association (NRA), the leader of the gun-rights lobby, which views any limits as an assault on the U.S. Constitution.
Main	Reuters/Ipsos polling data shows gun-rights supporters are particularly motivated to vote in November.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“It’s been a big concern for Democratic candidates that a lot of people will support gun control - but won’t make it an issue on which they’ll base their vote,” said University of California-Los Angeles professor Adam Winkler, the author of “Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America.”
Distant_Historical	In 2014, the last midterm election, the NRA reported $27 million in independent spending to back candidates who oppose gun limits, compared to $8.6 million by gun-control groups, according to the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.
Cause_General	The NRA did not respond to multiple requests for comment on its strategy for this year’s midterms.
Distant_Evaluation	Democrats believe now is the time to capitalize on the issue, said Tyler Law, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
Distant_Evaluation	“Republican inaction will continue to generate political backlash and help Democrats take back the House,” he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A spokesman for the Republican Party’s congressional campaign arm, Jesse Hunt, said the politics of gun violence would play out differently in every district and that the party’s candidates would pick their own positions.
Distant_Evaluation	U.S. Representative Steve Chabot, the Ohio Republican running against Pureval, said he had heard from voters on both sides of the gun issue.
Distant_Evaluation	“I don’t think anyone knows if it’s going to have an impact” on the election, said Chabot, who is unconvinced more gun restrictions will prevent violence.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	TARGETING SUBURBAN VOTERS
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Democrats have long feared that support for gun restrictions would cost them the backing of blue-collar swing voters – the group widely credited with tipping the presidential contest to Republican Donald Trump in 2016.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This year, a different voter bloc could help Democrats flip the 23 Republican seats needed to take control of the House: educated, suburban women who might normally lean Republican but see gun violence as increasingly personal, said Stuart Rothenberg, an analyst with the non-partisan website Inside Elections.
Cause_General	Reuters/Ipsos polling shows support for gun control has risen over time, from 57 percent of Americans who supported strong or moderate firearms restrictions in 2012 to 68 percent this year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Women are more likely to support restrictions, up from 63 percent in 2012 to 72 percent in 2018.
Distant_Evaluation	The problem with pushing gun-control in suburban districts is that many are not entirely suburban, said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.
Distant_Evaluation	“A lot of these districts have rural components that are not at all receptive to messages of gun control,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	VETERANS FOR GUN CONTROL
Cause_General	Many Democrats seeking Republican-held seats have made opposition to the gun lobby a feature of their campaigns.
Cause_General	Randy Bryce, an ironworker running in Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan’s Wisconsin district, released a television advertisement ahead of next month’s primary in which he fired a rifle and touted his experience in the Army before attacking the “NRA profit machine.”
Distant_Evaluation	In California, candidate Gil Cisneros has criticized Republican leaders for taking the gun lobby’s “blood money.” In Georgia, national gun safety activist Lucy McBath, whose son was shot to death six years ago, won the Democratic nomination for a competitive seat last week after blasting congressional inaction and the NRA.
Cause_General	On policy specifics, however, many Democratic candidates and gun-safety groups have staked out strategically moderate positions.
Cause_General	While virtually all Democrats support universal background checks - a policy most gun owners support, polls show - some stop short of embracing an assault-weapons ban.
Distant_Evaluation	Democratic Party officials say their success at recruiting military veterans this cycle makes it easier to run on gun limits.
Distant_Evaluation	Democratic House candidate Jason Crow - a veteran who served in Iraq and Afghanistan - argues that the NRA has stymied reasonable debate on gun policy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“It’s clearer than ever that this public health crisis is not going to get any better while our politicians are bought and paid for by the gun lobby,” said Crow, who supports an assault-weapons ban, expanded background checks and restricting the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines.
Cause_General	The NRA has backed Crow’s opponent in Colorado’s competitive sixth congressional district, Republican U.S. Representative Mike Coffman, with more than $114,000 since 2002.
Distant_Evaluation	In the current campaign, Coffman touts his support for increasing federal funding for mental health and school safety reforms while still opposing any substantive limits on gun sales.
Cause_General	The district includes the site of the 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora that killed 12 people and is near Columbine High School, where 13 people were murdered in a 1999 school massacre.
Distant_Historical	And yet two Democratic state legislators lost their jobs after pushing through a package of gun restrictions following the Aurora shooting.
Distant_Historical	Voters removed them in recall elections supported by the NRA.
Cause_General	In New Jersey, Republican House candidate Jay Webber supports expanding background checks and allowing judges to confiscate firearms at the request of family members, but has opposed a ban on high-capacity magazines.
Distant_Evaluation	Democrat Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy pilot, says Webber doesn’t go far enough.
Distant_Evaluation	She calls for an assault-weapons ban and limits on high-capacity magazines.

Distant_Evaluation	Still, she is careful to emphasize her military experience and support for basic gun rights, underscoring the delicate dance Democrats face in taking up the explosive issue.
Distant_Evaluation	“I’m not anti-gun.

Distant_Evaluation	But, she added, “The level of gun violence in this country is not normal.”
Main	ROME (Reuters) - Giuseppe Conte was sworn in on Friday as Italy’s prime minister, heading western Europe’s first anti-establishment government bent on overhauling European Union rules on budgets and immigration.
Cause_General	Conte, a little-known 53-year-old law professor, is backed by the 5-Star Movement which grew out of a grassroots protest network, and the right-wing League who together have issued a budget-busting agenda of tax cuts and higher welfare spending.
Cause_Specific	The government was formed after three months of political deadlock following inconclusive March 4 elections, with the former rivals striking a last-minute deal on Thursday to avert a fresh vote in high summer amid growing market turmoil.
Cause_General	Widespread voter disenchantment has seen anti-establishment parties upset mainstream politics across the continent, including Germany and France, but it is the first time they will run the government of a major western European country.
Cause_General	Conte made no comment to reporters after his swearing-in ceremony in the president’s 16th century palace in Rome, in a room with a huge gilt mirror flanked by Italian and EU flags.
Distant_Evaluation	“I admit that I am choked up and happy,” League leader Salvini said in a tweet which showed him for once formally dressed with his top shirt button done up for the occasion.
Cause_General	5-Star and the League have a solid majority in both houses of parliament, where the government will face confidence votes early next week in order to be fully empowered.
Cause_General	Italy hosted the European Union’s founding Treaty of Rome 60 years ago, but the once enthusiastically pro-EU Italians have progressively become disenchanted with Europe, blaming its fiscal rules for two decades of economic stagnation.
Cause_General	The disaffection has grown in recent years as hundreds of thousands of migrants have landed on Italy’s shores from north Africa, fuelling support for the League which accuses the EU of abandoning Italy to deal with the influx on its own.
Cause_General	Italy’s future in the euro zone has dominated the political uncertainty of the last week, with President Sergio Mattarella vetoing the coalition’s original choice for economy minister, the eurosceptic economist Paolo Savona.
Cause_General	That sparked a breakdown of the coalition’s first attempt to form a government and a furious reaction from the coalition leaders.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“COMMON CHALLENGES”
Cause_General	Savona had advocated a “plan B” to allow Italy to quit the euro if necessary, spooking financial markets.
Cause_General	Despite the souring sentiment towards Europe, two opinion polls this week showed between 60 and 72 percent of Italians did not want to abandon the euro.
Distant_Evaluation	European Council President Donald Tusk congratulated Conte on his appointment.
Distant_Evaluation	“To overcome our common challenges, we need unity and solidarity more than ever,” he said in a letter.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker tweeted that the EU’s executive would be “at Italy’s side on its reform path and remain attentive to Italy’s expectations of and proposals for the future of the EU.”
Distant_Evaluation	Ironically, after the swearing in at the Quirinale Palace, politicians who early this week were calling for Mattarella’s impeachment were to mingle with him at a reception in its manicured Renaissance gardens to mark the Feast of the Republic.

Cause_General	Financial markets, which sold Italian assets heavily early this week, have recovered as the prospect of a snap election receded.
Cause_General	Italy’s blue-chip share index close up 1.5 percent on the day and Italian bond yields fell for a third day.
Distant_Evaluation	Italians exasperated by the weeks of political stalemate were willing to give the coalition a chance.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I hope that this government will start well, we will see, but at least we should put them to the test,” said Rome pensioner Alberto Lapira.
Cause_General	Salvini will be the interior minister of the new government and 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio takes a powerful, newly-created joint ministry made up of the labor and industry portfolios.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Both leaders will also be deputy prime ministers and Conte may have a tough time proving he can be more than a puppet in the hands of his powerful political sponsors.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Salvini has promised to increase deportations of irregular immigrants and revamp the asylum system, while Di Maio will aim to implement 5-Star’s flagship policy of a guaranteed income of up to 780 euros per month for the poor.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While markets were relieved by the end of the political uncertainty, their mood will be tested if the coalition begins to follow through on its expensive policy pledges.
Cause_General	Italy, with debts totalling more than 130 percent of its economic output, is the most heavily indebted euro zone nation after Greece and is often described as “too big to fail” as the currency bloc could not bail it out if it were to default.
Cause_General	The 81-year-old Savona enters the government as European affairs minister, less powerful that the economy role but one that still allows him to negotiate with Brussels and speak on EU issues.
Error	Slideshow (7 Images)
Cause_General	His replacement as economy minister is economics professor Giovanni Tria, a little-known figure who has called for changes to EU budget rules and criticized Germany’s large current account surplus, without suggesting Italy should leave the euro.

Main	Acting on the order of BiH's Prosecutors Office Special Department for Organized Crime, Economic Crime and Corruption, colonel Ramiz Micivoda, 49, was arrested, BiH Prosecutors Office said in a statement Tuesday.
Cause_Specific	"""Micivoda is charged of abusing his official position and authorization in time of being an active member of BiH Armed Forces (BiHAF)."
Cause_Specific	"He was illegally requiring and receiving money, enabling persons to conduct their agricultural activities on land in the jurisdiction of Armed Forces,"" said the statement."

Main	"MANILA, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Congress granted President Rodrigo Duterte's request to further extend martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao for a period of one year to Dec. 31, 2019, to quell a ""continuing rebellion"" in the southern Philippine region."
Cause_Specific	After deliberating for almost four hours in a special joint session on Wednesday, lawmakers from both the Senate and the House of Representatives voted 235-28-1 in favor of another one-year extension of martial rule in Mindanao.
Cause_General	This is the third extension granted to Duterte since he imposed martial law in May 2017 after rebellion militants laid siege to Marawi City.
Cause_General	Under the martial law and the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in Mindanao, security forces are allowed to make arrests, detain or search without a warrant.
Cause_General	This means that people who have committed the crime of rebellion or even suspected ones may be arrested without a warrant of arrest, and objects that are used in the commission of the crime of rebellion may be seized without a search warrant.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"With the extension of martial law, Philippine Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said the Duterte government ""expects to achieve substantial progress in addressing the persisting rebellion in Mindanao, as well as promoting the overall security and peace and order situation in the island."""
Cause_Specific	"In a letter to Congress last week, Duterte asked lawmakers to allow the martial law to continue in Mindanao to quell terrorist groups that ""continue to defy the government by perpetrating hostile activities."""
Cause_Specific	"In justifying his request for a third extension of martial law in Mindanao, Duterte added that despite the significant progress, ""rebellion still persists in Mindanao and that the public safety requires the continuation of martial law in the whole of Mindanao."""
Cause_Specific	Specifically, he cited the several bombings that rocked many parts of Mindanao in the past few months that killed a number of people.
Cause_General	Mindanao has been the hotbed of violent extremism and a brewing rebellion for decades.
Cause_Specific	In more recent years, Mindanao witnessed the perpetration of numerous acts of violence like the Marawi siege and bombings in major cities.
Cause_Specific	Members of Duterte's security team, led by Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, briefed the lawmakers before the voting on the need to place Mindanao under martial rule, citing lingering threats from rebel and extremist groups.
Cause_Specific	"The team called upon Congress to allow the further extension of martial law ""to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP), the Philippine National Police (PNP) and all other enforcement agencies to put a decisive end to this ongoing rebellion and, thereby, remove a long-standing obstacle to the full rehabilitation and development of Mindanao."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Lorenzana, as martial law administrator, said the AFP ""will continue to uphold its mandate of defending the sovereignty of our state, upholding the integrity of our territory and protecting the democratic way of life of our people, with full respect for human rights, international humanitarian law and the primacy of the rule of law."""
Distant_Historical	Duterte initially imposed a 60-day martial law in Mindanao on May 23, 2017, after militants laid siege to Marawi, a predominantly Muslim city in Mindanao.
Distant_Historical	At the height of the intense fighting to retake Marawi from the pro-IS terrorist in July 2017, Duterte asked Congress to extend the martial law until December 2017, a request that lawmakers easily approved.
Distant_Historical	When the extension expired in December 2017, Duterte again asked Congress to extend it until Dec. 31, 2018.
Cause_General	The 1987 Philippine Constitution only allows the president to declare martial law for a maximum of 60 days.
Cause_General	Any extension would require approval from Congress.

Main	TOKYO, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan's central government on Friday began offshore landfill work for the relocation of a controversial U.S. military base in Okinawa amid staunch protests from locals.
Main	In the coastal Henoko region in Nago on the island, the planned location of the replacement facility for the U.S. Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, sand and soil started being dumped just before noon local time in an area spanning more than six hectares on the southern side of the landfill site.
Cause_General	Protestors gathered from early morning to voice their opposition to the landfill work and the building of a new base, which will eventually see 157 hectares of land reclaimed from pristine waters, and the building of a V-shaped runway.
Distant_Anecdotal	A man in his 60s was quoted as saying the central government had lost the trust of the people of Okinawa over the base relocation issue.
Distant_Anecdotal	A women in her 70s held a placard stating that the will of the (Okinawa) people should not be ignored.
Distant_Anecdotal	"A placard held by another lady also in her 70s read: ""No more U.S. bases."
Distant_Anecdotal	"Americans go home!"""
Distant_Evaluation	"Okinawa Governor Denny Tamaki, who held last-ditch talks with Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga and Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya a day earlier in a bid to halt the landfill work, told reporters Friday that ""I cannot help feeling strong resentment toward the work being carried out in defiance of the prefectural residents' will."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Tamaki, a staunch opponent of the central government's plans to relocate the base under a pact made with Washington in 1996, said the central government maintaining such a forceful position on the issue would lead the Okinawan people to ""voice their anger even stronger."""
Distant_Historical	Anti-U.S. sentiments were stoked on the tiny island by the rape in 1995 of an elementary school girl by three U.S. servicemen.
Cause_General	Tamaki was elected as governor in September's gubernatorial election on a platform of opposing the base's relocation and lessening Okinawa's base-hosting burdens and has since been pushing to resolve the issue through dialogue with the central government.
Cause_Specific	The central government, however, despite Tamaki's push for face-to-face talks, has forged ahead unilaterally with land reclamation work necessary to build the new base after the land ministry issued an injunction to suspend Okinawa revoking a permit for the landfill work.
Cause_Specific	The Okinawa prefectural government's appeal for the suspension of work for the relocation of the controversial base was also dismissed by a lower court with the ruling upheld by the Naha branch of the Fukuoka High Court on Dec. 5.
Cause_General	Okinawa hosts the bulk of U.S. military facilities in Japan, yet the tiny sub-tropical island accounts for just a small fraction of Japan's total landmass.
Distant_Evaluation	As well as shouldering the majority of U.S. bases and being victims of U.S. base-linked workers' criminal activities, which span rape and murder, to driving under the influence of alcohol, as well as a flow of accidents and mishaps involving U.S. military aircraft, the new location for the base has an extremely delicate ecosystem unique to Okinawa that the locals desperately want to protect.
Distant_Evaluation	Tamaki had previously said that the central government's persistent push to continue with the landfill work is completely unacceptable and against the will of Okinawans who wish to see the base moved outside of Okinawa and Japan altogether.
Distant_Evaluation	The prefectural government is urging the people of Okinawa to make their voices heard nationally and internationally by calling a referendum on the issue next year.
Main	KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia’s general election this week will be an extraordinary contest, pitting a 92-year-old former authoritarian leader and a jailed reformist he fell out with 20 years ago against a prime minister who has been mired in a multi-billion-dollar scandal.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Few doubt that Prime Minister Najib Razak’s Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, which has ruled Malaysia for the six decades since independence, will triumph in Wednesday’s poll.
Distant_Evaluation	But a robust challenge from the opposition - spearheaded by nonagenarian Mahathir Mohamad, the country’s longest-serving prime minister, and his one-time protege Anwar Ibrahim - has produced the most hotly contested election yet.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Momentum is with the opposition, but we believe it is unlikely that they will pull off a surprise victory,” said the Eurasia Group consultancy, which put the odds of a win for Mahathir’s Pakatan Harapan (Alliance of Hope) at 15 percent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, the political risk group’s Asia director, Peter Mumford, said there is a danger for the ruling coalition that it will fare worse than the 2013 election, when for the first time it lost the popular vote but still won with 133 of parliament’s 222 seats.
Cause_General	Under Malaysia’s simple majority system, the party that gets the most seats in parliament wins even if it does not secure the popular vote.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	An unconvincing victory would leave Najib, 64, with reduced political clout and he could face pressure from within his party to stand aside ahead of the next election, Mumford said.
Distant_Evaluation	That would be a blow for Najib, who has survived an uproar surrounding 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state fund that racked up heavy debt after he took power in 2009.
Cause_General	The prime minister has consistently denied any wrongdoing over the billions of dollars that were allegedly siphoned off from the state fund and he has been cleared of any offence by Malaysia’s attorney general.
Distant_Evaluation	FRIENDS AND FOES
Cause_General	Under Najib, a skyscraper called The Exchange 106 has come up in Kuala Lumpur that will replace Mahathir’s pet project, the Petronas twin towers, as the tallest on the capital’s skyline.
Distant_Evaluation	The two buildings are testimony to Malaysia’s transformation from a rural backwater to an industrial nation, but they are also emblems of the bitter rivalry between the two leaders.
Distant_Historical	Mahathir, who ruled with an iron fist for 22 years, was once Najib’s mentor but turned against him over the 1MDB affair and quit the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party, which represents the country’s Malay majority.
Distant_Historical	Then, in an even more unlikely change of heart, Mahathir last year buried a feud with Anwar, 70, and the two agreed to join forces to oust Najib.
Distant_Historical	Mahathir sacked Anwar as his deputy prime minister in 1998.
Distant_Historical	Anwar then started a movement known as “Reformasi’ - reform - to end UMNO’s race- and patronage-based governance, but he was stopped in his tracks by charges of sodomy and graft, which he denied, but for which he was jailed.
Distant_Historical	Anwar was imprisoned again in 2015, when Najib was prime minister, after another sodomy charge, which he described as a politically motivated attempt to end his career.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mahathir has promised to seek a royal pardon for Anwar if they win the election and, once Anwar is free, to step aside and let his protege-turned-foe-turned-ally become prime minister.
Distant_Evaluation	Reformasi supporters have been dismayed by Anwar’s reconciliation with the very man who tried to block their movement, but Anwar’s daughter, lawmaker Nurul Izzah, says the opportunity to defeat Najib’s coalition is what matters most.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“It took us many years to get to this point, and if you’re not smart or wise enough to join all these forces together, we might lose the chance at wresting power from BN,” she told Reuters recently.
Cause_General	TIGHT RACE
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The opposition alliance, which counts on urban votes and support from the ethnic Chinese and Indian communities, is hoping Mahathir will draw in rural Malay voters who have long been loyal supporters of BN but are now disillusioned by increased costs of living.
Cause_General	A survey released by pollster Merdeka Center last week showed the opposition making gains, but not enough to land a majority of parliament’s seats.
Cause_General	It saw Mahathir’s alliance winning 43.7 percent of the popular vote in peninsular Malaysia and BN 40.3 percent.
Cause_General	The poll did not cover the Borneo states of Sabah and Sarawak, which have historically been pro-BN although there have been recent signs of a swing away from the government in Sabah.
Distant_Evaluation	The opposition has complained that a revision of electoral boundaries in March tilted the election in BN’s favor by moving large numbers of opposition-leaning voters into fewer parliamentary constituencies.
Distant_Evaluation	The Election Commission insists its electoral map changes did not favor the ruling coalition, and the government says there was no political interference in the exercise.

Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump tried on Tuesday to calm a storm over his failure to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, saying he misspoke in a joint news conference in Helsinki.
Cause_Specific	Trump stunned the world on Monday by shying away from criticizing the Russian leader for Moscow’s actions to undermine the election and cast doubt on U.S. intelligence agencies, prompting calls by some U.S. lawmakers for tougher sanctions and other actions to punish Russia.
Main	“I said the word ‘would’ instead of ‘wouldn’t,’” Trump told reporters at the White House, more than 24 hours after his appearance with Putin.
Main	“The sentence should have been, ‘I don’t see any reason why it wouldn’t be Russia.’”
Cause_Specific	A Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted after his news conference with Putin found that 55 percent of registered U.S. voters disapproved of his handling of relations with Russia, while 37 percent approved.
Cause_Specific	Trump, who had the opportunity to publicly rebuke Putin during the news conference in Helsinki, instead praised the Russian leader for his “strong and powerful” denial of the conclusions of U.S. intelligence agencies that the Russian state meddled in the election.
Cause_Specific	Standing alongside Putin in Helsinki, Trump told reporters he was not convinced it was Moscow.
Cause_Specific	“I don’t see any reason why it would be,” Trump said.
Cause_General	Although he faced pressure from critics, allied countries and even his own staff to take a tough line, Trump said not a single disparaging word in public about Moscow on any of the issues that have brought relations between the two nuclear powers to the lowest ebb since the Cold War.
Distant_Evaluation	Republicans and Democrats accused him of siding with an adversary rather than his own country.
Cause_General	Despite a televised interview and numerous postings to Twitter, Trump did not correct himself until 27 hours later.
Main	Reading mainly from a prepared statement, Trump said on Tuesday he had complete faith in U.S. intelligence agencies and accepted their conclusions.
Distant_Evaluation	He then veered from his script to hedge on who was responsible for the election interference: “It could be other people also.
Distant_Evaluation	There’s a lot of people out there.”

Distant_Evaluation	Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump’s comments on Tuesday were another sign of weakness, particularly his statement that it “could be other people” responsible for the election meddling.
Distant_Evaluation	“He made a horrible statement, tried to back off, but couldn’t even bring himself to back off,” Schumer said on the Senate floor.
Distant_Evaluation	“It shows the weakness of President Trump that he is afraid to confront Mr. Putin directly.”
Cause_General	The political firestorm over Trump’s performance in Helsinki
Cause_General	has engulfed the administration and spread to his fellow Republicans, eclipsing most of the frequent controversies that have erupted during Trump’s turbulent 18 months in office.
Distant_Evaluation	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that Russia was not a friend of the United States and warned against a repeat of election meddling in November’s congressional elections.
Distant_Evaluation	“There are a lot of us who fully understand what happened in 2016 and it really better not happen again in 2018,” McConnell said.

Cause_General	Several senators from both parties backed tougher sanctions on Russia.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called Russia’s government “menacing,” said their chambers could consider additional sanctions on Russia.
Distant_Historical	Congress overwhelmingly passed a sanctions law last year targeting Moscow for election meddling.
Distant_Historical	In April, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on Russian officials and oligarchs in one of Washington’s most aggressive moves to punish Moscow.
Distant_Historical	Even before the allegations of Russian meddling, tensions were high over Moscow’s concerns about NATO expansion, Russian annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014 and its military backing of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war.
Distant_Evaluation	Some U.S. lawmakers have suggested passing resolutions voicing support for intelligence agencies, or spending more to enhance election security and prevent cyber attacks.
Distant_Evaluation	Republican Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said congressional leaders were searching for the most effective response.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’re trying to figure out what would be an appropriate way to push back,” Corker told reporters.
Distant_Evaluation	“You know the president can do more damage in 15 minutes at a press conference than we can undo in six months of passing resolutions.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Corker said “the first step” would be hearing from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who will testify next Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Distant_Evaluation	Senate Democrats said they wanted the American interpreter at the Helsinki meeting to testify to Congress on what was said during the private Trump-Putin session.
Distant_Historical	U.S. intelligence agencies concluded last year that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election campaign and sought to tilt the vote in Trump’s favor, which Moscow has denied.
Cause_General	Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating that allegation and any possible collusion by Trump’s campaign.

Distant_Evaluation	COLOMBO/MALE (Reuters) - Maldives accused the United States of intimidation on Friday, a day after Washington called for the release of “falsely accused” political prisoners and threatened action if the island’s upcoming election is not free and fair.
Main	Maldives is due to hold a presidential election on Sept. 23 when incumbent Abdulla Yameen will seek a second five-year term.
Distant_Evaluation	Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman at the U.S. State Department, said in a statement released on Thursday that the United States was concerned about continued “democratic backsliding in Maldives” ahead of the vote.
Distant_Evaluation	“We join the international community in calling for the release of falsely accused political prisoners; full implementation of the Maldivian Supreme Court’s February ruling overturning the convictions of opposition members; an end to executive interference in the Parliament and judiciary ...” Nauert said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Absent Maldives’ return to a democratic path, the United States will consider appropriate measures against those individuals who undermine democracy, the rule of law, and a free and fair electoral process,” she said.
Distant_Evaluation	The Maldives’ foreign ministry said on Friday that the United States’ call for the release of ‘falsely accused political prisoners’ was seen as “an act of intimidation” and imposing undue influence on the democratic processes of a sovereign state before a key poll.
Cause_General	It urged the United States to allow the Maldivians to freely decide who should lead them on Sept. 23 for the next five years.
Distant_Evaluation	“It should be noted that the Maldives has no political prisoners, and all those who have been convicted have undergone due process,” it said in a statement.
Cause_General	The Indian Ocean tourist island has been beset by political instability since a police mutiny forced its first democratically elected leader, Mohamed Nasheed, to quit in 2012.
Distant_Historical	President Yameen imposed a state of emergency earlier this year, since lifted, to annul a Feb. 1 Supreme Court ruling that quashed convictions against nine opposition leaders and that ordered his government to free those held in prison.
Cause_General	His government has rejected repeated requests by the United Nations, rights groups, and the West to release the president’s rivals and follow fair legal procedures.
Cause_General	The European Union in July warned of possible sanctions ranging from travel bans to asset freezes against those in the Maldives responsible for human rights violations and undermining the rule of law.
Cause_General	In the election, Yameen will be challenged by veteran lawmaker Ibrahim “Ibu” Mohamed Solih representing the opposition Democratic Party after former president Nasheed, who now lives in exile in Sri Lanka, withdrew as a candidate after the national election commission ruled him ineligible to run.

Main	WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- In unusual pushbacks against the Trump administration, the GOP-controlled U.S. Senate on Thursday voted to recommend ending U.S. military assistance to the Saudi-led operation in Yemen, and accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of involvement in the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Main	Immediately after the 56-41 vote on a resolution concerning the Yemen conflict, the Senate unanimously passed a separate one that blames the Saudi crown prince for Khashoggi's murder and urges Saudi Arabia to hold accountable anyone responsible for his death.
Cause_General	In the first resolution, lawmakers recommended that the U.S. government should stop its backing of the Saudi-led operation in Yemen, despite the briefings of senior officials like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense James Mattis last month.
Cause_General	"In the second resolution, the Senate believed that the Saudi crown prince is ""responsible for the murder"" of Khashoggi, and urging the Saudi Arabian government to ""ensure appropriate accountability."""
Cause_General	The bipartisan votes came amid the Capitol Hill's growing outrage over high civilian casualties in Yemen, plus U.S. intelligence officials' reported conclusion that the Saudi leader must have at least known the murder of Khashoggi.
Distant_Evaluation	"Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who co-sponsored the Yemen resolution with Republican Senator Mike Lee, said the vote has shown the Senate's view ""that the constitutional responsibility for making war rests with the United States Congress."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""Today we tell the despotic government of Saudi Arabia that we will not be part of their military adventures,"" he said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""So let us go forward today ... and tell the world that the United States of America will not continue to be part of the worst humanitarian disaster on the face of the earth."""
Cause_Specific	The resolution condemning Saudi Arabia's role in Khashoggi's death was introduced by senators like Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker and majority leader Mitch McConnell, both of whom are Republicans.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The two resolutions, unlikely to either get passed by the House or approved by U.S. President Donald Trump, were seen as largely symbolic, U.S. media reported.
Cause_General	Pompeo and Mattis had briefed the full House on the U.S.-Saudi relations, especially the Yemen conflict and the case of Khashoggi in a classified condition.
Cause_Specific	Khashoggi has been missing since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Cause_Specific	"The Saudi authorities said he died in a ""brawl"" in the consulate, and denied that the Saudi crown prince had ordered the killing."
Cause_Specific	After releasing the results of its initial investigation, the Saudi Public Prosecution announced that 18 Saudis were arrested for their alleged connections with the killing.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The U.S. Congress has urged a thorough investigation into his death, and threatened to take more actions against Saudi Arabia, such as sanctions and suspension of military support for the Saudi-led attack in Yemen, if those responsible were not held accountable.
Distant_Evaluation	However, the Trump administration has been reluctant to further punish the Saudi government.
Distant_Evaluation	"Pompeo said in a recent article that the death of Khashoggi has ""heightened the Capitol Hill caterwauling and media pile-on."""

Cause_General	But this is not a political rally.
Cause_General	Dressed in white robes and a turban, Novel Bamukmin of the Jakarta chapter of the Islamic Defenders Front (FPI), a hardline Islamist group, addresses evening prayers in a mosque.
Main	As a year of local and then national elections begins this week in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country, some Islamic leaders have emerged as the most vocal opponents of President Joko Widodo, who is expected to seek a second term next year.
Cause_General	They belong to a loose grouping of Islamists behind protests that culminated in the election defeat and jailing for blasphemy in 2017 of Jakarta’s ethnic-Chinese and Christian governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, a Widodo ally.
Distant_Evaluation	The case of Purnama, who had said political rivals were deceiving people by using a verse in the Koran to say Muslims should not be led by a non-Muslim, showed how Islam had crept into politics in the officially secular country.
Cause_General	Widodo has pledged to protect Indonesia’s tradition of pluralism and moderate Islam, and he has banned Hizb ut-Tahrir, a hardline group with ambitions for an Islamic caliphate.
Distant_Evaluation	But a senior government official conceded there are limits to how much the government can control political messaging in mosques.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Any action against this phenomenon is blasted as anti-Muslim so our actions are restricted,” said the official, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Distant_Evaluation	‘CHANGE THE PRESIDENT’
Cause_General	A former furniture maker and Indonesia’s first president from outside the political and military elite, Widodo - known as Jokowi - has remained popular since he took office in 2014.
Cause_General	He is widely seen as an honest man of the people, rare for a leader in a country where the political class is scorned as corrupt and aloof, and his push for infrastructure and cutting red tape has burnished his image as a hands-on leader.
Cause_General	A recent opinion poll gave him a double-digit lead over the opposition Gerindra party’s Prabowo Subianto, a retired general who is expected to run a second time against Widodo in 2019.
Distant_Evaluation	Opponents and hardline Muslim groups, including the FPI, accuse Widodo of failing to stem income inequality or deliver higher growth, but the most incendiary attacks have often been around religion and ethnicity.
Distant_Evaluation	False accusations have spread on social media that the president is not actually Muslim and is a descendant of ethnic Chinese communists.
Cause_General	Widodo has sought to strengthen his ties with moderate Islamic leaders and he recently appointed a controversial hardline cleric as a communications adviser.
Distant_Evaluation	“The only way for the opposition to win is to debunk the argument that Jokowi is one of the masses, and to attack his weakest spot, which is his shyness in showing his religion,” said Achmad Sukarsono, a political analyst at Control Risks.
Distant_Evaluation	Ahead of local elections across much of the country on Wednesday, the anti-Widodo sentiment has crystallized into a movement called “#GantiPresiden2019” or “Change the president in 2019”.
Distant_Evaluation	The movement’s founder, Mardani Ali Sera, a member of parliament from a conservative Islamic party, says he has no connection with political messaging in mosques.
Distant_Evaluation	But he says the majority of those affiliated with his movement are from Islamic parties and the groups that opposed Jakarta’s Christian governor.
Distant_Evaluation	“We don’t use mosques but if the hashtag and the movement works for you, then go ahead and use it,” Sera, who is active on social media, told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	The FPI’s Bamukmin supports the #GantiPresiden2019 movement and said he and other preachers push that message in sermons.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is the duty of Muslims to try and replace the current president who has betrayed the country and his religion,” he said, accusing Widodo of “selling the country to foreigners” and “empowering communists and deviant religious sects”.
Cause_General	NO CAMPAIGNING ALLOWED
Cause_General	Indonesia’s election laws prohibit political campaigning in places of worship ahead of polls.
Cause_General	Vice President Jusuf Kalla told media political discussion is allowed in mosques because they are places of education as well as worship, but campaigning is not.
Distant_Evaluation	The government can do little to stop such activity in mosques, said a spokesman for the religious affairs ministry.
Distant_Evaluation	“If there are clerics who use mosques for political interests, it’s better that the public itself persuades them to stop.
Distant_Evaluation	It is not in the ministry’s capacity to identify or stop them,” said Mastuki, who goes by one name.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Opinion polls suggest candidates backed by parties supporting Widodo will win in many parts of Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, but observers will be watching for signs of Islamist influence.

Cause_General	They voted with the center-right, opposition Alliance bloc to sink the government of Social Democrat prime minister Stefan Lofven on Tuesday.
Distant_Evaluation	But at consultations on forming a new administration on Thursday, said they would not back an Alliance government.
Error	(GRAPHIC: Swedish election scenarios - tmsnrt.rs/2p45tJh)
Main	“We will not, either actively or passively, support a government that does not give us influence,” Sweden Democrats leader Jimmie Akesson told reporters after meeting the speaker of parliament, who met all party leaders on Thursday.
Cause_General	The speaker, Andreas Norlen, has four attempts at picking a prime minister who can get support from parliament - a process that could take weeks.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If he fails there will be a new election within three months.
Cause_General	After his meetings, Norlen said he had not asked any potential candidate to try and put together a government yet.
Distant_Evaluation	“My judgment is that we will probably need one or more rounds ... of discussions with the partly leaders,” he told reporters.
Distant_Evaluation	“They are not all in agreement on how things should proceed.”
Cause_General	Lofven and Alliance leader Ulf Kristersson are both claiming the right to build a new minority administration.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Kristersson said he wanted to form a government consisting of his Moderate party and its Centre, Liberal and Christian Democrat allies.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With 143 members of parliament, that grouping is one seat smaller than Lofven’s center-left bloc.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Centre and Liberal parties ruled out such an arrangement unless it was backed by Lofven’s Social Democrats.
Distant_Evaluation	“I do not plan to be a hostage to the Sweden Democrats in a government,” Centre Party leader Annie Loof told reporters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lofven, whose Social Democrats are the biggest party in parliament, is hoping that the Centre and Liberal parties will support him if their only other option is a deal with the Sweden Democrats.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But splitting the Alliance would probably consign the center-right to years in opposition and few parties have fared well after cooperating with the Social Democrats.

Cause_General	Support for the Green Party dipped to 4.4 percent at the most recent election, down from 6.9 percent after four years in a coalition with Lofven, their worst result since 1991 when they dropped out of parliament.
Distant_Historical	The Centre party slumped in polls after backing a Social Democrat government in the early 1990s.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson said he would prefer a government of the Moderates, the biggest Alliance party, and the Christian Democrats, but that they would have to his party a say in policy to get his support.
Main	BERLIN (Reuters) - Senior German conservatives on Sunday backed Chancellor Angela Merkel’s bid for re-election as chairwoman of her Christian Democrats (CDU) at a party congress in December, lending her much needed support as in-fighting weakens her authority.
Error	German Chancellor Angela Merkel arrives for the German Unification Day celebrations at the Berlin Cathedral in Berlin, Germany, October 3, 2018.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Merkel has vowed to serve her full term in office until the end of the legislative period in 2021, and has said she will run to remain as chairwoman.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Her CDU party holds a vote on the chairmanship at a congress in the northern city of Hamburg in early December.
Distant_Evaluation	Merkel suffered an unexpected blow to her authority last month when her conservatives cast out long-standing ally Volker Kauder as head of the parliamentary party, reflecting rising discontent with her 13-year-old leadership.
Distant_Evaluation	The upset victory of Ralph Brinkhaus, described as a “political thunderbolt” and “the beginning of the end of the Merkel era” by opposition leaders, was widely taken as a sign that lawmakers want more say in shaping the policies of her fourth and final government.
Distant_Evaluation	Brinkhaus’ election by the conservative block comprising Merkel’s CDU and their Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) sister party - know as the Union - was a clear sign of lawmakers’ frustration with her ruling style.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But parliament speaker and former finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told mass-selling Bild am Sonntag newspaper that Brinkhaus election could bring some stability to the conservative block rocked by in-fighting over immigration.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The change at the top of the parliamentary faction could stabilize the chancellor,” Schaeuble said.
Distant_Evaluation	“There has been an uneasy mood within the union for some time.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It is possible that (Brinkhaus’ election) was an opportunity to vent out.”
Distant_Evaluation	The CDU and CSU have struggled to maintain a united front on immigration policy and the fate of the scandal-hit chief of the domestic spy agency.
Cause_General	In the summer, CSU leader and Interior Minister Horst Seehofer brought the government to the brink of collapse with a threat to turn back migrants at the border with Austria if they had already applied for asylum elsewhere in the European Union.
Main	Seehofer, the fiercest critic of Merkel’s decision in 2015 to open Germany’s borders to almost one million, mainly Muslim asylum seekers, told Welt am Sonntag that he backed the chancellor’s bid to be re-elected as CDU chairwoman.
Cause_General	“Angela Merkel has announced that she would like to run for the party’s chairmanship.
Main	I think it is the right decision,” Seehofer said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Merkel said on Saturday that her conservatives must end their in-fighting to reverse slides in the polls before two regional elections this month.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Polls indicate the CSU will lose its absolute majority in the Bavarian parliament in an election in the southern state on Oct. 14, bleeding support to the ecologist Greens and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Support for Merkel’s CDU is also projected to fall, to around 29 percent, in an election in the state of Hesse two weeks later.
Distant_Historical	The party won 10 percentage points more in the election five years ago in Hesse, where it governs with the Greens.

Distant_Historical	"BERLIN, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- When more than a million asylum seekers arrived in Germany in 2015, the country's initial reaction was summed up by its veteran chancellor Angela Merkel in three words: ""We can do it!"""
Distant_Historical	And Merkel reiterated whenever questioned about the challenges that the influx of refugees would create.
Cause_General	"Three years later, Merkel's fourth governing cabinet has moved away from what became known as the ""open door policy"" in September 2015."
Main	The federal government has now swerved decisively to the right on migration, a move that was underscored by a recent compromise reached to resolve bitter infighting over asylum policy between the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Christian Social Union (CSU) conservative sister party and coalition partner.
Cause_General	CDU-CSU SPAT OVER ASYLUM POLICY
Cause_General	"Following the publication of his ambitiously-named ""migration master plan"" in June, interior minister and CSU leader Horst Seehofer threatened to resign unless Merkel endorsed the complete document or found a comparable solution on a European level within the course of two weeks."
Cause_General	Most controversially, Seehofer wanted to refuse asylum access to German territory if migrants had formally entered the Schengen zone via another country.
Distant_Evaluation	The ultimatum imposed by Seehofer on the chancellor marked a historically unprecedented show of cabinet disobedience in Germany, which threatened to unravel the entire ruling grand coalition.
Distant_Evaluation	"At least initially, Merkel was critical of the ""migration master plan."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	She warned of a potential domino effect in the European free travel area caused by its unilateral border control provisions, as neighboring states rush to shutter their internal Schengen borders in response.
Cause_General	Yet instead of sacking the rebellious minister, the chancellor hurried to a meeting in Brussels, where she managed to secure a vague agreement from Germany's European partners to toughen and expand their joint asylum policies.
Cause_General	"Upon return to Berlin, she then struck a deal with Seehofer to resolve the CDU-CSU spat by establishing ""transit centers"" on German-Austrian borders, where asylum seekers who are already registered in the European Union (EU) will be detained before being transferred on to the responsible member state."
Distant_Evaluation	"The outcome raised eyebrows in European capitals, with many observers arguing that the negotiated agreement was much closer to Seehofer's ""master plan"" for a strict and national asylum regime than Merkel's vision of European solidarity around the issue."
Distant_Evaluation	HARDENING STANCE ON MIGRATION
Distant_Evaluation	The hardening of Berlin's stance on migration was also seen to have occurred with peculiar timing, in light of official data that pointed to a steady decline of new asylum applications and related pressures in Germany since 2015.
Distant_Evaluation	"The latest step taken by the interior ministry towards the implementation of the ""migration master plan"" is a case in point."
Cause_General	The interior minister recently announced that the Spanish government had offered to take back asylum seekers from Germany who were already registered in Spain.
Cause_General	Responding to a query by Handelsblatt newspaper, Seehofer's ministry admitted, however, that not a single individual would have been affected by the bilateral agreement during the past two months.
Cause_General	"Madrid's offer to help prevent so-called ""secondary migration"" of asylum seekers within the Schengen free-travel area specifically applies to individuals who are intercepted at the German-Austrian border."
Cause_General	Although eight asylum seekers who were pre-registered in Spain were registered in Germany during the past two months, none of them had entered the country from Austria.
Distant_Evaluation	Given the geographic location of Spain in the far West of Europe, it is highly unlikely that refugees and other irregular migrants will take a detour to Germany via its South-Eastern neighbor Austria.
Distant_Evaluation	The data was thus seen by critics of the deal, and Seehofer's politics more generally, as evidence that the CSU leader is unnecessarily stoking popular fears with anti-immigrant symbolism.
Cause_General	According to the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), the number of first-time asylum applications in Germany has plummeted from 722,370 applications in 2016 to 198,327 applications in 2017.
Cause_General	The German Federal Criminal Police Office's (BKA) further reported that overall criminal offences declined by 9.6 percent from 2016 to 2017, contrary to suggestions by some that the mass arrival of refugees in the country would unleash a national crime wave.
Distant_Evaluation	"Speaking to Xinhua, Kai Unzicker, a senior project manager at the Bertelsmann Foundation, argued that as once predicted by Merkel, Germany had in fact coped well under the pressure of the ""refugee crisis."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""Cities and communities have achieved enormous successes in collaboration with an active and open civil society."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Unzicker readily admitted that ""housing and catering for such a large amount of people on such notice was logistically and financially challenging."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Nevertheless, the situation ""relaxed again"" quickly as of 2016, when the number of new arrivals began to drop."
Distant_Evaluation	As a consequence, Unzicker argued that the federal government's harsher rhetoric on asylum owed more to psychological and political factors than any significant deterioration in citizens' quality of life.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Racist and xenophobic appearances and stances have poisoned the public debate in Germany."
Distant_Evaluation	"Even though crime and unemployment rates are at all-time lows, fear and insecurity are being promoted,"" he warned."
Distant_Evaluation	CHANGING PUBLIC ATTITUDES AHEAD OF ELECTIONS
Cause_General	A visible sign of changing popular attitudes was found in a poll in July, in which the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party overtook the German Social Democrats (SPD) as the country's second largest party.
Distant_Evaluation	"In turn, the SPD publicly attacked the CSU for damaging the reputation of the government by attempting to ""drag it to the right-wing spectrum of politics."""
Distant_Evaluation	That the CSU is attempting to change its tune may reflect the party's growing desperation ahead of looming regional elections in its Bavarian homestead.
Distant_Evaluation	Polls suggest that the CSU is set to lose its long-standing legislative majority in the state, as the AfD attracts growing numbers of voters who feel disenfranchised by what they view as an aloof political elite.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In spite of the AfD's evident momentum, Robert Vehrkamp, senior advisor at the Bertelsmann Foundation, argued that the CDU and CSU would both benefit politically from a consensus on abstaining from copying the language and rhetoric of right-wing populists.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Vehrkamp also cautioned that centrist parties risked legitimizing populist adversaries if they simply copied their strategies.
Distant_Evaluation	So far, the CSU's efforts to ward off a challenge from the AfD do appear to have born little fruit.
Cause_General	In an opinion survey published by Deutsche Welle shortly after the CDU and CSU reached their compromise on asylum, Seehofer's approval rating plummeted by 16 percent to 27 percent.
Cause_General	By contrast, Merkel only witnessed a slight monthly drop in her reading to 48 percent (minus two percentage points).
Distant_Evaluation	When it comes to the chancellor, it seems the German electorate is still forgiving of the ideological pragmatism which she has repeatedly demonstrated during over 12-year rule.
Main	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - As a final vote nears on U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, key undecided Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski is under growing pressure from diverse groups in her home state of Alaska.
Error	FILE PHOTO: U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh meets with Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., August 23, 2018.
Error	REUTERS/Chris Wattie/File Photo
Distant_Evaluation	Murkowski is one of a handful of U.S. senators who will decide the outcome of the extremely close confirmation battle over Kavanaugh.
Cause_General	The nominee angrily denied allegations of sexual misconduct in a hearing last Thursday before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.
Cause_Specific	Liberal and women’s rights groups have clogged Capitol Hill hallways and filled Alaskan airwaves with advertisements to crank up the pressure on Murkowski, while Alaska Native groups have rallied outside her home-state offices.
Distant_Evaluation	While she has mostly been tight-lipped about her thinking as the partisan war on Kavanaugh’s nomination rages, Murkowski on Wednesday described as “inappropriate” comments by President Donald Trump on Tuesday mocking university professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were high school students in 1982.
Distant_Evaluation	In making her decision, “I am taking everything into account,” Murkowski told reporters.
Cause_General	Trump’s fellow Republicans control the Senate by a 51-49 margin.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That means if all the Democrats vote against Kavanaugh, Trump could not afford to have more than one Republican oppose his nominee, with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tiebreaking vote.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Alaska’s complicated politics will certainly be a factor in Murkowski’s decision.
Cause_Specific	Trump carried Alaska by 15 percentage points in 2016 and polls show Republicans strongly back Kavanaugh’s nomination.
Cause_Specific	A Reuters/Ipsos poll of U.S. adults released on Wednesday found that 70 percent of Republicans supported Kavanaugh.
Cause_Specific	On the other hand, the Alaska Federation of Natives, the state’s largest indigenous organization and one of Murkowski’s most powerful supporters, condemned the nomination.
Cause_Specific	Alaska Natives, who make up about 15 percent of the state’s population, have expressed concern that Kavanaugh’s court decisions reflect a willingness to erode indigenous and tribal rights.
Cause_Specific	Alaska Governor Bill Walker, an independent, and Lieutenant Governor Byron Mallott, a Democrat, have also called for Kavanaugh to be rejected, criticizing him on Alaska Native rights, healthcare and other issues.
Cause_Specific	Local activists have held regular protests outside Murkowski’s offices in Anchorage, Juneau and Fairbanks.
Cause_Specific	Last week, someone projected a message on a prominent downtown Anchorage hotel: “YO LISA, FIND ANOTHER JUDGE.”
Cause_Specific	The Alaska Native groups also fear Kavanaugh would endanger Obamacare, a vital part of the tribes’ healthcare coverage, and undermine crucial environmental protections.
Distant_Evaluation	“Alaska Natives have a long and proud history of defending this land and its resources.
Distant_Evaluation	We have no intention of staying silent now,” Richard Peterson, president of the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, said in a letter to Murkowski.
Main_Consequence	‘UNPRECEDENTED’ CALL VOLUME
Cause_General	A variety of national outside groups have also targeted Murkowski, along with other moderate Republican senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Jeff Flake of Arizona.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The groups hope to find a receptive audience in Murkowski, who has a reputation for thinking independently and not voting strictly on partisan lines.
Cause_General	She is one of the few Senate Republicans who supports abortion rights and was one of three Senate Republicans who joined Democrats last year to defeat a Republican bill repealing the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare.
Distant_Historical	In 2010, she won re-election by waging a write-in campaign after losing in the Republican nominating contest to a candidate from the conservative Tea Party movement.
Cause_Specific	Pro-Kavanaugh forces in Alaska have not been as visible as the Kavanaugh opponents, although the National Rifle Association gun rights lobby ran television advertisements on his behalf in Alaska and other groups have paid for grassroots organizing.
Main_Consequence	Murkowski told public radio in Alaska on Tuesday she was getting an “unprecedented” number of calls and emails about the nomination from both sides.
Main_Consequence	“We’ve hired additional staff to do nothing more than to sort through the volume of calls that have come in overnight,” she said.
Cause_Specific	The Alaska Grassroots Alliance, a liberal state activist group, has been holding anti-Kavanaugh rallies and appealing to Murkowski’s reputation for independence.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I’m asking her to show up for us, not for her party as a rubber stamp, but for Alaskans with real concerns about the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh,” Jeff King, a four-time champion of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, told a recent rally outside Murkowski’s Anchorage office.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	May next year is the most recent deadline Prayuth’s junta has set for a vote its critics hope will return Thailand to civilian rule after more than four years of military rule, although it has repeatedly pushed back the timeline.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Critics say the military aims to maintain its grip on power beyond the election and they point to a military-backed constitution that limits the authority of civilian politicians.
Main	“I can say right now that I am interested in politics,” Prayuth, who has previously sidestepped questions about his political future, told reporters on Monday.
Distant_Evaluation	“Because I love my country, like all Thai people,” he said.
Cause_General	He did not elaborate on his comments.
Distant_Historical	As army chief, Prayuth, 64, led a 2014 coup that ousted a civilian government to end a prolonged period of sometimes deadly unrest.
Cause_General	Technically Prayuth cannot stand for election under the constitution, because he would have had to resign from his post since 2017 to do so.
Distant_Evaluation	Prayuth said on Monday he did not intend to quit as junta chief.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, Prayuth could return as prime minister if a political party nominated him as its frontrunner.
Cause_General	The constitution offers Prayuth another route.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He could be chosen as an “outside prime minister” if 500 members, or two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the Upper House Senate, voted to kickstart the process, if the winning party’s candidate failed to get enough votes.
Distant_Evaluation	Watana Muangsook, a member of the opposition Puea Thai Party, welcomed Prayuth’s participation in the next election but said he must first give up his post as junta chief.
Distant_Evaluation	“You may join whichever party, but you should resign as junta chief to lay down your weapons and play fair like everybody else,” Watana told Reuters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The junta, formally known as the National Council for Peace and Order, has promised to relax its curbs on political activities before the vote, to allow political parties to complete administrative tasks between September and December.
Main	The Senate went on record for the first time on Tuesday in favor of a withdrawal date from Iraq, with Democrats marshaling the votes they needed to deliver a forceful rebuke to President Bush's war policy.
Main	By a vote of 50 to 48, with a few crucial votes shifting in favor of the Democratic position, the Senate rejected a Republican effort to strip from the military spending bill any mention of a withdrawal date.
Cause_General	The legislation will now move forward with a nonbinding goal of beginning a gradual withdrawal of American troops from Iraq within 120 days of the measure's enactment, with a pullout by March 31, 2008.
Distant_Evaluation	''When it comes to the war in Iraq, the American people have spoken, the House and Senate have spoken,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No.
Distant_Evaluation	2 Democrat in the Senate.
Distant_Evaluation	''Now, we hope the president is listening.''
Cause_General	Senators still must vote on the overall legislation this week, and then their bill must be reconciled with a House measure passed Friday.
Cause_Specific	The House voted 218 to 212 for a binding measure requiring the president to bring most American combat troops home from Iraq by September 2008.
Cause_General	A few minutes after the vote on Tuesday in the Senate, the White House repeated its vow to veto any legislation containing a withdrawal date.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Senate action increases the likelihood that Congress and Mr. Bush will engage in a confrontation over the financing of the war.
Distant_Evaluation	The outcome of the Senate vote took both parties by surprise.
Distant_Evaluation	Republicans were stung by the defection of Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, who has not supported a timetable for withdrawal before although he is his party's most outspoken critic of the war in Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	''There will not be a military solution to Iraq,'' Mr. Hagel declared.
Distant_Evaluation	''Iraq belongs to the 25 million Iraqis who live there.
Distant_Evaluation	It doesn't belong to the United States.
Distant_Evaluation	Iraq is not a prize to be won or lost.''
Cause_Specific	The Democrats also gained the vote of Senator Ben Nelson, a Nebraska Democrat, who voted against a withdrawal date just two weeks ago.
Distant_Evaluation	''People want our troops home,'' Mr. Nelson said.
Cause_Specific	The two other senators who crossed party lines were Gordon H. Smith, an Oregon Republican, who supported the withdrawal date, and Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat, who opposed the plan.
Cause_Specific	Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, voted with the Republicans.
Distant_Evaluation	The Senate vote was seen as a victory for Democrats, if only because Republicans had already agreed not to stand in the way of the legislation by mounting a filibuster that requires 60 votes to pass a bill.
Distant_Evaluation	Republican leaders said they preferred to allow Mr. Bush to veto the bill, rather than use procedural maneuvers to block the measure, which would provide $122 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Distant_Evaluation	The impassioned debate on Tuesday illustrated that majorities in each party remained hardened in their views.
Cause_General	Vice President Dick Cheney, who also serves as president of the Senate, arrived in the Capitol a few minutes before 5 p.m. to be on hand in the event of a tie.
Cause_General	Two senators were not present: Mike Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, and Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota, who is in rehabilitation after a brain hemorrhage.
Cause_General	As the debate opened Tuesday, several Republicans spoke forcefully against the notion of setting a specific date -- even a nonbinding one -- to get troops out of Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	Several Republican senators argued that the Congressional debate over Iraq has failed to factor in new developments in the country, where military commanders report signs of progress.
Distant_Evaluation	''This bill should be named the Date Certain for Surrender Act,'' said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican.
Distant_Evaluation	''A second-year cadet at West Point could tell you that if you announce when the end will be, it's a recipe for defeat.''
Cause_General	Mr. McCain, who had planned to be away from the Capitol on Tuesday campaigning for his presidential bid, turned to a large map of Iraq positioned next to him on an easel as he made his argument.
Cause_General	He pointed to areas around the country where Gen. David H. Petraeus, the American commander, has reported some success in his new military plan.
Distant_Evaluation	''We cannot give up,'' Mr. McCain said, ''just as we are starting to turn things around in Iraq.''
Distant_Evaluation	The Senate action on Tuesday alters the dynamics of eventual negotiations between the House and Senate to reconcile their different approaches.
Distant_Evaluation	Had Republicans prevailed, the Senate bill would have had no timetable, while the House version required a withdrawal no later than Sept. 1, 2008.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Democratic leaders were considering whether they should eliminate the timeline entirely before sending the measure to Mr. Bush, but with both chambers approving a time frame, it is now almost certain a final measure will include some requirements for withdrawal.
Distant_Evaluation	Dana Perino, the deputy White House press secretary, said the president was ''disappointed that the Senate continues down a path with a bill that he will veto and has no chance of becoming law.''
Distant_Evaluation	She said Congress should allow General Petraeus's mission to succeed ''by providing our troops the funding they need -- not by mandating failure.''
Distant_Evaluation	But Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and a war critic since the conflict began four years ago, said the combination of the House and Senate votes was momentous.
Distant_Evaluation	He said it showed how far the Democratic Congress had come toward removing troops since the beginning of the year, adding that political and policy momentum was on their side.
Distant_Evaluation	''Rather than continuing to defy the will of the American people and Congress by threatening to veto this legislation,'' Mr. Kennedy said, ''President Bush should put the Iraqis on notice.''
Cause_Specific	Three more Republicans who have expressed serious reservations about the course of the war -- Senators Susan Collins of Maine, Norm Coleman of Minnesota and John W. Warner of Virginia -- sided with their colleagues in trying to strip the timetable from the spending legislation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	All three senators are facing tough re-election fights next year.
Distant_Evaluation	Ms. Collins said she was more troubled by the requirement that the administration begin removing troops within 120 days of the legislation rather than the March 2008 deadline for having most of the military out.
Distant_Evaluation	''I don't think it is wise to have an abrupt withdrawal from Iraq,'' said Ms. Collins, who said she was willing to wait until August to see if the continuing troop increase improves conditions there.
Distant_Evaluation	''This doesn't mean I support an unending commitment of our troops in Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	I don't.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Coleman said he believed that the Democratic plan was intended to score political points and that establishing such a public timeline for getting out of Iraq was militarily ill-advised.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Warner, who has criticized the administration's conduct of the war, said he remained committed to changing policy in Iraq, but not by imposing Congressional timetables on American troops.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''It would be the bugle of retreat,'' Mr. Warner said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''It would be echoed and repeated from every minaret through Iraq: the coalition forces have decided to take the first step backward.
Distant_Evaluation	We cannot send that message.
Distant_Evaluation	Not at this time.''
Cause_General	Correction: March 29, 2007, Thursday Because of an editing error, a front-page article yesterday about a vote by the Senate to support a date for withdrawing troops from Iraq misstated the withdrawal provision in the Senate legislation.
Cause_General	Beginning a pullout of American troops within 120 days of the measure's enactment is a requirement, not a goal.
Cause_General	Completing the pullout by March 31, 2008, is a nonbinding goal of the legislation.

Main	JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia will accept international help for disaster response and relief after a major earthquake and tsunami hit Sulawesi island, killing at least 832 people, the head of the Indonesian investment board said on Twitter on Monday.
Main	President Joko Widodo agreed to accept international help on Sunday night, Thomas Lembong said.
Main	Lembong said he would coordinate private sector help from around the world.
Cause_General	Authorities scrambled to get food, aid and equipment into Sulawesi on Monday as the death toll appeared certain to rise, three days after the 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami hit the island.
Cause_General	Countries such as Thailand and Australia have already offered to help.
Main	SYDNEY (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck off the southern coast of Papua New Guinea’s New Britain island on Friday, initially triggering a tsunami warning for surrounding coastlines, but there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.
Cause_General	The shallow quake struck close to the coast, around 100 miles (162 km) southwest of Rabaul, a much more remote region than the country’s mountainous mainland highlands where a magnitude 7.5 tremor struck on Feb. 26, killing 100 people.
Main_Consequence	The Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre (PTWC) issued a threat warning for the country’s coastline located within 300 km of the quake’s epicenter, but later advised that the threat had passed.
Distant_Anecdotal	Dellie Minding, a receptionist at the Rabaul Hotel in the east of New Britain, around 20 minutes from the coast, told Reuters that the earthquake was felt, with many guests running outside, but there was no damage.
Distant_Anecdotal	At the Rapopo Plantation Resort on the coast, receptionist May Dovon said she had not heard of any casualties or damage.
Distant_Anecdotal	“We felt the earthquake, everything was moving so we went out of the building,” Dovon told Reuters.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Nothing was damaged.”
Distant_Evaluation	Australian authorities said there was no threat to the Australian coastline from the quake, which was initially reported as a magnitude 7.2.
Distant_Evaluation	Quakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.
Cause_General	Rabaul lies in the shadow of Mount Tavurvur, an active volcano that destroyed the town in 1994 during a severe eruption.
Cause_General	The latest quake came as Papua New Guinea struggles to get aid to survivors of the Feb. 26 quake, which flattened whole villages and spoiled water supplies on the country’s main island.
Main_Consequence	The impoverished country is also missing its largest revenue earner since the quake forced a shutdown of Exxon Mobil Corp’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which has annual sales of $3 billion at current LNG prices.
Main_Consequence	The company is still assessing quake damage at its facilities.

Main	HAVANA, Sept. 22 (Xinhua) -- An Air China's 747 aircraft arrived Friday at Jose Marti International Airport with humanitarian aid to Cuba after the Caribbean nation was badly hit by the Hurricane Irma.
Cause_General	The first plane with 86 tons relief materials like tents, generators, folding beds, blankets, water pumps, luminaires, among others, sent by China to Cuba on Friday.
Cause_Specific	Upon receiving the aid at the airport, Chinese Ambassador to Cuba, Chen Xi said that based on the traditionally friendly relations between the two peoples, the Chinese government decided to send emergency humanitarian aid to the Caribbean nation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We hope these materials can contribute to the reconstruction of the affected areas and in addition to this emergency aid, China will send six ships full of rice to Cuba before the year ends,"" he said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The envoy said three more flights will be made with this type of aircraft to complete the aid offered by Beijing to Havana.
Error	.
Distant_Evaluation	"""China and Cuba are friendly countries that over the years have supported each other and are firmly united in difficult situations,"" Chen said."
Distant_Evaluation	Antonio Carricarte, Cuba's first deputy minister of foreign trade and investment, thanked this sign of solidarity by the Chinese government as part of the historic ties of friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This help confirms the important relations between Cuba and China because we are brother countries and we have ties of friendship, solidarity and respect,"" he said upon receiving the relief goods at the airport."
Distant_Evaluation	He also said China despite being geographically distant from Cuba sends this aid to express its solidarity and its government understands the magnitude of the damages caused by the hurricane to the island.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Regardless of the size of the country or its economies, it is also an expression of the relationships that can exist between large nations like China and smaller ones like Cuba,"" the official said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A 9-member team of the Red Cross Society of China also participated in the welcome ceremony and in the coming days will be installing and handing over the humanitarian aid to the areas most affected by the storm.
Cause_General	With this aid China joins other countries in the world that have sent humanitarian relief to Cuba after the passing of Hurricane Irma where it left a trail of destruction particularly in the central provinces of the country.
Cause_General	Irma hit Cuba as a category-5 hurricane and during its path through the north coast of the island, left at least ten dead, 1.7 million people evacuated, heavy floods and serious damages to the tourism infrastructure, agricultural areas and housing.
Main	After touring empty homes that still bear the scars of Hurricane Katrina, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday that bureaucratic red tape was ''strangling people'' trying to rebuild here, and proposed steps to speed money to current and former residents of the city.
Main	Most of Mrs. Clinton's ideas involved waiving or streamlining federal rules for distributing relief money, chiefly through the Federal Emergency Management Agency, that require multistep paperwork, matching dollars or specific purchases.
Cause_General	The senator, a New York Democrat seeking her party's presidential nomination in 2008, has also proposed legislation to make FEMA an independent, cabinet-level agency.
Distant_Evaluation	Some of Mrs. Clinton's ideas, like eliminating a rule that states and cities provide a match to federal emergency dollars, were the sort that community leaders have pushed for some time, and she drew applause from residents who met with her to express frustration about the pace of recovery here.
Distant_Evaluation	''I am embarrassed by our failures as a nation; this administration has really let our country down,'' she said.
Distant_Evaluation	''Let's cut this red tape.
Distant_Evaluation	It's strangling people.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mrs. Clinton also took a glancing shot at Senator David Vitter of Louisiana, a Republican who she said was not working hard enough with Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, on hurricane issues.
Distant_Evaluation	''She has been waging a lonely battle,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
Distant_Evaluation	''She hasn't had much support from her counterpart; let me just lay it on the table here.''
Cause_General	Calls to Mr. Vitter's offices were not returned last night.
Distant_Evaluation	At one point, Mrs. Clinton visibly bristled after walking through the home of Gerard Washington, in the Broadmoor district, and hearing him tell of being ripped off by contractors and strung along by government relief programs.
Cause_General	Broadmoor is one of the areas that benefited from the fund-raising efforts led by former President Bill Clinton and the first President Bush.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''I'm counting on you as president to come through for us,'' Mr. Washington told Mrs. Clinton outside his half-rehabilitated home.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	She replied: ''I'll help you as president; count on it.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	I'm not going to stand for stuff like this.
Distant_Evaluation	It makes me furious.''
Cause_General	They shook hands, and Mrs. Clinton departed, saying, ''God bless you.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Washington was one of several African-American city residents who said they planned to vote for Mrs. Clinton for president.
Distant_Evaluation	The most common reasons given were her well-publicized support for hurricane recovery efforts, and her political partnership with Mr. Clinton; several voters said they were excited by the idea of his returning to the White House.
Cause_General	THE Big Top toy store on East Hartsdale Avenue reopened May 11 just as signs were being stripped from the shuttered HSBC Bank nearby.
Cause_Specific	Both businesses were closed after being damaged by flooding in the northeaster that ripped through Westchester on April 15.
Cause_General	While owners of the Big Top decided to reinvest, HSBC is taking its business elsewhere, a reflection of the struggling state of the shopping district that runs along the street above the Hartsdale train station.
Distant_Anecdotal	''As one business goes, it takes away some business to me,'' said Munish Kapur, owner of the Big Top, which depends heavily on foot traffic.
Distant_Anecdotal	''We still don't know how many of the closed businesses will go and how many will stay.
Distant_Anecdotal	That's a concern.''
Main	More than a month after heavy rains flooded many parts of the county, about a half-dozen businesses along the avenue are still closed -- including at least two restaurants, a bagel shop, a bakery, a fitness center and a green market.
Distant_Anecdotal	The two that have completely reopened -- Tip Top and Hartsdale Wine and Liquors -- are watching closely to see if shoppers return.
Distant_Anecdotal	''I'm a little nervous,'' said Robert Troy, the wine shop owner.
Distant_Anecdotal	Kar C. Kwok, owner of K. Fung's, a Chinese restaurant, said he was unsure how he would come up with the $250,000 to $300,000 needed to make repairs.
Distant_Anecdotal	Water filled the basement of the establishment and reached more than six inches high in the first-floor dining room.
Distant_Anecdotal	Flooring was destroyed, furniture and restaurant equipment was ruined and mold is beginning to grow in the basement.
Distant_Anecdotal	His insurance did not cover the damage.
Distant_Anecdotal	''I want to stay,'' he said, ''but I have no idea how I will do that.''
Cause_General	Several merchants who had applied for low-interest loans with the Federal Emergency Management Agency have yet to hear back.
Distant_Anecdotal	But it was unlikely a loan would come close to covering his damage, Mr. Kwok said.
Cause_General	Other businesses were moving as fast as possible to reopen.
Distant_Evaluation	But every passing day means another day with no income and the possibility that customers will take their business elsewhere.
Distant_Anecdotal	''It's pretty devastating for everybody, even those businesses that are open,'' said Craig Cupani, owner of Lia's, an Italian restaurant, which hoped to reopen this week.
Distant_Anecdotal	Mr. Cupani noted that although all the businesses that were flooded are on the same side of the street, businesses on the other side, which have remained open, are also suffering because some customers -- like those who go to the fitness center -- are not coming to the area.
Distant_Anecdotal	The shuttered shops had also hurt strides made in generating business in the area, he said, which has struggled in recent years to compete against large retailers on nearby Central Avenue.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	To try to draw more people to the area, Paul J. Feiner, the Greenburgh supervisor, has proposed opening a satellite library in a vacant site like the old HSBC building.
Distant_Evaluation	Many residents and merchants welcome the idea.
Distant_Anecdotal	''It's one block, but it's an incredibly useful block,'' said Shula Darviche, a marketing consultant who lives in the neighborhood.
Distant_Anecdotal	''It really adds to the life in this little suburb.''
Distant_Evaluation	Beyond retaining customers, merchants are also worried about the need to address the conditions that led to the flooding.
Distant_Evaluation	Some charge that drainage behind their stores is inadequate and want local officials to address the problem.
Distant_Anecdotal	''We've got to make sure this doesn't happen again,'' said Mr. Cupani, who along with other merchants, has hired an engineer to examine the issue.
Distant_Anecdotal	''There's no way anybody is going to recoup from another one of these.''

Main	HAVANA, Sept. 25 (Xinhua) -- Cuba on Monday offered humanitarian and medical aid to Puerto Rico which was hit by the devastating Hurricane Maria last week and left in a precarious economic and social situation.
Main	Cuba's deputy Foreign Minister Rogelio Sierra said Havana has offered to send to San Juan an emergency campaign hospital with 39 doctors to help the needed population with health services.
Main	"""Cuba also offers to send four brigades of electric workers to help our sister nation rebuild its electrical system,"" said the official in his Twitter account."
Cause_General	Cuba has already sent medical and relief brigades to Dominica and Antigua and Barbuda, which are also affected by recent hurricanes Maria and Irma.
Cause_General	This offer must be accepted by Washington as Puerto Rico is a commonwealth of the United States and Cuban aid workers and doctors must be granted U.S. visas.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"However, in the current state of Cuba-U.S. relations, it seems unlikely the White House will approve such offer as Washington has threatened to cut diplomatic ties with Havana over an alleged ""sonic attack"" in the island against U.S. diplomats."
Distant_Historical	U.S. President Donald Trump already rolled back in June the historic opening started by his predecessor Barack Obama, although the new regulations haven't been published by U.S. federal agencies or departments.
Distant_Historical	Cuba last offered humanitarian and medical aid to the U.S. in 2005, when former President Fidel Castro said the island could send doctors to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina devastated that city, but then U.S. President George W. Bush rejected the offer.

Main	LOS ANGELES, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Lane, predicted as the biggest weather threat to Hawaii in decades, moved perilously close to the Aloha State Thursday morning, triggering heavy rain, landslide and flooding.
Main_Consequence	Videos posted by local residents on Twitter showed that flooding already has been running on the streets as Lane tracks toward the islands, with the eastern part standing on the strong windward side of the hurricane.
Main_Consequence	Parts of Big Island have measured 7 to 12 inches of rain in the past 12 hours, Hawaii County officials reported, adding that multiple landslides on Hwy 19 on Big Island made the road hazardous for travel.

Cause_General	In Alaska, people packed into high schools and other evacuation centers after the quake hit shortly after midnight local time (0900 GMT).
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Officials had warned residents as far south as San Francisco to be ready to evacuate coastal areas but by 5:15 a.m. PST (1315 GMT) the U.S. National Weather Service had lifted all tsunami advisories, watches and warnings for California, Oregon Washington and Alaska.
Cause_General	Canadian officials lifted one for coastal British Colombia.
Cause_General	In Alaska, residents gathered in shelters on Kodiak Island, the closest land point to the temblor, around 160 miles (250 km) southeast of Chiniak, Alaska, at a depth of 25 km - considered shallow but with broader damage - according to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
Cause_General	There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage from the quake, which was initially measured at magnitude 8.2.
Distant_Anecdotal	“People are fine,” said Neil Hecht, assistant principal of Kodiak High School, which was sheltering a few hundred people.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Spirits are high.”
Distant_Evaluation	Long lines of traffic formed in coastal communities including Homer and Seward, Alaska, residents said on social media.
Cause_General	In Homer, a few hundred cars were packed into its high school parking lot.
Distant_Anecdotal	Shawn Biessel, a 32-year-old park ranger, and his mother were in the lot, a few hundred feet above sea level.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It was a really obvious, pretty strong, long quake.
Distant_Anecdotal	A good rumbler,” Biessel said in a phone interview.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It went on for a solid minute and after a while we thought we should get outside.”
Distant_Anecdotal	Police drove through Biessel’s neighborhood with flashing lights to alert residents to evacuate, Biessel said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	San Francisco briefly warned residents within three blocks of the Pacific Ocean or five blocks of San Francisco Bay to prepare to evacuate.
Cause_General	That warning was later lifted.
Distant_Evaluation	Earthquakes of similar magnitude are not uncommon in Alaska, which is seismically active.
Cause_General	The state has recorded 11 tremors with a magnitude of 7 or greater within 373 miles (600 km) of Tuesday’s quake over the past century, according to Zachary Reeves, a USGS seismologist in Golden, Colorado.
Distant_Historical	The largest U.S. earthquake ever recorded was a magnitude-9.2 temblor in Alaska in March 1964, causing tidal waves of more than 100 feet (30 m) high that killed 131 people.
Main	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - The U.S. region most vulnerable to tsunamis - the massive waves of water unleashed by undersea earthquakes - is dangerously under-prepared, experts and officials in Oregon and Washington state said after a magnitude 7.9 earthquake this week.

Error	REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo
Cause_Specific	The quake that struck in the Gulf of Alaska late Monday, triggering a tsunami warning for Alaska and a tsunami watch for the U.S. West Coast, rekindled concerns that a seismic sea wave along the northwest coast could kill, injure or displace tens of thousands of people and cause billions of dollars in damage.
Cause_General	In this week’s quake, the warnings and watches were quickly lifted, and there was no damage from the slight change it caused in the ocean.
Main	But experts worry that in some parts of the region there is too little information about where tsunamis might occur, and in others too much infrastructure built in locations known to face a threat.
Distant_Evaluation	“There’s still a lot that needs to be done,” said Corina Forson, Washington’s chief hazards geologist.
Main	Scientists in the state have pinpointed just half the locations where a destructive tsunami triggered by the Cascadia subduction zone off the northwest coast might come ashore, and about 10 percent of sites that might be hit by a wave emanating from the Seattle fault zone, Forson said.
Main	She called the lack of information dangerous.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A tsunami could send a wall of water 50 feet (15 meters) high crashing onto the coast, or a wave 16 feet (5 meters) high into Seattle, the state’s largest city, she said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If there’s the real thing and people don’t have evacuation routes and plans, they won’t know where to get to safety and it could be life-threatening,” she said.
Cause_General	In neighboring Oregon, officials have created evacuation plans and public awareness campaigns to help people prepare.
Main	But the state has not done enough to stop people from building in potential danger zones, said Jay Wilson, former chairman of the Oregon Seismic Safety Policy Advisory Commission.
Cause_General	“There are about 30,000 people who live in the tsunami zones,” Wilson said.
Main	“If we do everything right, they’re going to run up to the top of the hill.
Main	And then they’re all going to be permanently displaced.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	DEADLY THREAT
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Parts of Oregon and far northern California have up to a 37 percent chance of a tsunami from a rupture of the Cascadia subduction zone in the next 50 years, said Chris Goldfinger, a tsunami and earthquake expert with the Oregon State University.
Distant_Evaluation	Tsunamis are generally produced when tectonic plates move against each other under the ocean in subduction zones, displacing ocean water through powerful quakes.
Distant_Evaluation	They have a deadly history.
Distant_Historical	The 2011 quake and tsunami in Japan killed up to 18,000 people and wrecked Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant, causing the worst meltdown since the Chernobyl disaster in the former Soviet Union.
Distant_Historical	The 2004 Asian tsunami killed 226,000 people.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A big tsunami on the Oregon coast could kill up to 10,000 people, said Althea Rizzo, the state’s geologic hazards program coordinator.
Cause_General	In recent years, Oregon has instituted practice drills at schools and hospitals, provided evacuation materials to tourists in their hotel rooms and in some areas painted blue evacuation lines to higher ground on roads and paths, Rizzo said.
Distant_Historical	The city of Seaside, Oregon, voted in 2016 to fund a bond measure to move its schools out of the inundation zone.
Cause_General	There are statewide restrictions on building essential facilities like hospitals in tsunami zones.
Main	But updated maps showing where those zones are located have not been incorporated into the law, meaning the restrictions might not apply in areas that are now known to be dangerous, Wilson said.
Main	“In the Northwest our biggest problem is not getting the word out, it’s that our built infrastructure is very vulnerable,” said Goldfinger.
Main	“Buildings within a tsunami zone are pretty much going to be destroyed.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	California is considering adopting international zoning standards for tsunami zone construction, as well as “blue line” evacuation routes like those in Oregon, said Rick Wilson, senior engineering geologist for the California Geological Survey.

Distant_Anecdotal	In Manzanita on the Oregon coast, resident Kerry Driscoll said she has an evacuation plan and the cabins at the beachside resort where she works are equipped with pamphlets telling tourists how to prepare.
Distant_Anecdotal	But tsunamis can come with little warning, and she knows it might be hard to get out.
Distant_Anecdotal	“If we don’t have major advance warning I don’t think there’s much that we can do,” Driscoll said.

Main	WASHINGTON, Sept. 6 (Xinhua) -- Florence has weakened slightly to a Category 3 hurricane but should remain a powerful storm for several more days, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said late Wednesday.
Cause_General	The hurricane was located about 1,990 km east-southeast of Bermuda and 1,750 km east-northeast of the northern Leeward Islands, with maximum sustained winds of 205 km per hour, according to the Miami-based weather agency.
Main	Some gradual weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, with restrengthening possible over the weekend, it added.
Cause_General	There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.
Cause_General	Florence, the first major hurricane of the Atlantic season, was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane earlier in the day, with maximum sustained winds of 215 km per hour.
Cause_General	Florence is the basin's sixth named storm of the year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Forecasters have said the Atlantic hurricane season is now expected to be less active as it enters its peak months due to a combination of conditions in the ocean and atmosphere that helps to limit storm development.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They are expecting nine to 13 named storms with winds of 62 km per hour or higher, of which four to seven will strengthen into hurricanes.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Of those storms, there may be up to two major hurricanes, which are classified as Category 3, 4 and 5 with winds of 177 km per hour or higher.
Cause_General	Tropical Storm Gordon has weakened into a tropical depression over the U.S. state of Mississippi after making landfall late Tuesday near the Alabama-Mississippi border with near-hurricane level winds, killing a two-year-old child when a tree fell on her family's mobile home in Pensacola, Florida.
Cause_General	By Wednesday afternoon, Gordon's center was well inland, dumping heavy rains and causing flooding in western Florida and coastal Alabama, the NHC said.
Main	State and local governments in Gulf Coast areas devastated by the 2005 hurricanes will no longer be required to pay 10 percent of the cost of repairing their roads, schools and other public works, under a provision of the emergency war spending bill approved by Congress on Thursday night.
Distant_Evaluation	Louisiana officials had said that the need to cover some of the repair costs themselves, instead of having the federal government assume all costs, was significantly slowing their recovery efforts.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They praised Congress for making the change, which they estimated would save the state and its affected communities at least $775 million.
Cause_General	Mississippi will also benefit from the change, to a lesser degree.
Cause_General	The Bush administration had earlier opposed lifting the requirement, but after long and intense negotiations with Congress over the much larger provision financing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, the president signed the bill yesterday.
Distant_Evaluation	''We are thrilled,'' Gov.
Distant_Evaluation	Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana said in a telephone interview.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The exemption, Ms. Blanco said, will particularly help local governments crippled by the storms.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In addition to the direct financial advantage, the waiver will reduce the paperwork that local governments must complete to get federal financing for infrastructure, said Andy Kopplin, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That in itself will save some money, and will also hasten rebuilding.
Distant_Evaluation	''This definitely puts the foot down on the accelerator in terms of speeding up the recovery,'' Mr. Kopplin said.
Cause_General	Under a law enacted by Congress in 1988, the Federal Emergency Management Agency can pay for 90 percent of infrastructure repairs after significant natural disasters.
Cause_General	The requirement that state and local governments match that by paying the other 10 percent was intended to prevent fraud and waste by giving them a financial stake in their own projects.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Louisiana intends to use money freed by the new waiver to help shore up its federally financed program helping homeowners rebuild their houses.
Cause_General	That program, called the Road Home, is facing an eventual shortfall of about $2.9 billion, according to state estimates.
Cause_General	More families have applied than the state anticipated, and have qualified for higher-than-expected grants.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	New Orleans has been counting on the waiver to help pay for its own rebuilding plan.
Distant_Evaluation	Mayor C. Ray Nagin issued a statement yesterday saying the city was very pleased with the exemption, which he called critical to recovery.
Cause_General	Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, had made a concerted effort to get Congress to waive the 10 percent requirement.
Cause_Specific	Ms. Landrieu was able to get a waiver included in a previous version of the war spending bill as well, but that measure was vetoed by President Bush because of its troop-withdrawal timetable.
Cause_General	Although the federal government eliminated the payment requirement after past disasters like Sept. 11 and Hurricane Andrew, the administration refused to do so after the 2005 hurricanes, arguing that it had given Louisiana enough federal money to cover the local governments' share of the costs.
Distant_Evaluation	But Louisiana officials said that this money came with significant strings attached and that qualifying for it put a huge regulatory burden on overwhelmed local governments, which have applied for federal assistance for about 20,000 projects so far.
Distant_Evaluation	States and localities also said they simply did not have the money to put up a 10 percent match.
Cause_General	The waiver is not the only help that the newly enacted law affords the gulf region.
Main	The measure also includes $1.3 billion for repairs to levees along the Mississippi River around New Orleans, and permits the federal government to forgive repayment of disaster loans made to the communities affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Main	In addition, it provides for grants for various recovery programs in the region, including one to recruit teachers in Louisiana and another to fight crime by helping New Orleans pay for more police officers and prosecutors.

Error	(Xinhua/Joachim Bywaletz)
Main	BERLIN, Jan. 18 (Xinhua) -- Storm Friederike brought powerful winds, heavy rain, and snowfall to parts of Germany on Thursday, causing at least one fatality and severe disruption to railway lines.
Main_Consequence	A 59-year-old man was killed by a falling tree and several people were injured in similar incidents throughout the country following the arrival of storm in the morning.
Main_Consequence	Trains ceased operation in the states of North-Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony, leaving many passengers stranded.
Main_Consequence	Furthermore, travel speeds of trains in other parts of Germany were slowed considerably in reaction to hurricane-strength gusts.
Cause_General	So far, extreme wind strengths of up to 130 km per hour have been measured at higher elevations of Western Germany.
Cause_General	Large amounts of snow fell closer to the Alps in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg.
Distant_Evaluation	The national meteorological service (DWD) has advised citizens to remain indoors in areas most-affected by the storm due to risks posed by falling debris, de-rooted trees, and potential damage to power lines.
Main_Consequence	Schools in several German states were closed for the day.
Cause_General	Major airports have been adversely affected by the weather as well.
Main_Consequence	Flights were cancelled out of security concerns at Duesseldorf airport, while the Cologne-Bonn airport was forced to temporarily close down entirely.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The DWD believes Friederike will leave behind less damage than experienced after storm Xavier in October 2017.
Distant_Historical	At the time, trees carried more leaves and were particularly prone to collapse under wind pressure due to their larger surface area.
Distant_Historical	Seven people were killed in related incidents.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Meteorologists expect the current storm to travel on from Western Germany to the states of Saxony and Southern Brandenburg over the course of Thursday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Throughout the country, weather patterns will remain unsteady in the coming days while temperatures drop.
Cause_General	Miles and miles of bigger and stronger levees have been built along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers since the deadly floods of 1993, and millions of dollars have been spent on drainage improvements.
Main	Yet as the rush of water that caused the Missouri River to overflow its banks and submerge dozens of towns last week rolled toward St. Louis on Monday, attention was turned to a metropolitan region that since 1993 has seen runaway residential and commercial development in the rivers' flood paths.
Cause_General	About 28,000 homes have been built and more than 6,000 acres of commercial and industrial space developed on land that was underwater in 1993, according to research by Nicholas Pinter, a geologist who studies the region at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.
Cause_General	Building is happening on flood plains across Missouri, but most of the development is in the St. Louis area, and it is estimated to be worth more than $2.2 billion.
Cause_General	Though scientists warn about the danger of such building, the Missouri government has subsidized some of it through tax financing for builders.
Distant_Evaluation	''No one has really looked at the cumulative effect,'' said Timothy M. Kusky, a professor of natural sciences at St. Louis University, who calculates that there has been more development on the Missouri River flood plain in the years since 1993 than at any other time in the history of the region.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The good news for St. Louis right now is that forecasters say the two rivers will crest well below their 1993 levels by Tuesday, sparing the area significant flooding.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But many scientists remain concerned that the effect of the new construction, should a levee break, could eventually be even more severe flooding.
Distant_Evaluation	Levees constrict a river's path and raise its water level, which causes higher, faster flow.
Distant_Evaluation	A flood plain, conversely, exists in nature to absorb a river's overflow.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''The more levees we build, the higher we have to build them,'' Professor Kusky said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's a self-perpetuating problem.''
Distant_Evaluation	Still, people have been drawn to the area, assured by the sense of security the levees provide.
Distant_Evaluation	Disincentives beyond the possibility of flooding seem to be few.
Distant_Evaluation	''This was absolutely a dodged bullet,'' Professor Pinter said.
Distant_Evaluation	''This could have been a very bad situation for St. Louis, but luckily it was a near-miss.''
Cause_General	People living in the flood plains are eligible for the National Flood Insurance Program or for any private insurance they can secure, though the private alternatives are increasingly difficult to obtain.
Cause_General	And they are entitled to whatever federal disaster relief is offered to the state after a flood, be it temporary housing or buyouts, said Butch Kinerney, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Distant_Historical	THF Realty Inc. used Missouri's tax program, known as tax increment financing, to build what is said to be the largest strip mall in the country on land in the Chesterfield Valley area of St. Louis County that was submerged in the floods of 1993.
Cause_General	The shopping center, which cost $275 million to build, opened in 1999 and now has more than two million square feet of retail space, mall officials said.
Distant_Historical	The developers spent more than $35 million on levee and storm drainage improvements, replacing an old levee that had offered protection against a 100-year flood with a levee that met the standards for a 500-year flood.
Distant_Evaluation	And, they said, they have brought jobs and revenue to a formerly sleepy part of the county.
Distant_Evaluation	''We built the shopping center and interchange that opened the entire valley,'' said Marian Nunn, the chief operating officer of THF Realty.
Distant_Evaluation	''The difference is that the levee is maintained now, on top of being bigger, stronger and better.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The risks are really substantially mitigated.''
Distant_Evaluation	The company was able to use the special financing because Missouri allows it for projects in areas that are considered blighted, or where development is not likely to occur without help.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''We will continue to build even more,'' Ms. Nunn said.
Distant_Evaluation	Faith in the levees seems to trump other concerns here.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''We're not even close to having any issues,'' said Brian McGownd, the deputy director of public works in Chesterfield.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Of the new levee, Mr. McGownd said, ''We have 100 percent confidence that it's done right, and the way it's supposed to be, and that it will be a good, strong levee for many years.''
Distant_Evaluation	Fear of flooding did not appear to scare off prospective buyers at the New Town at St. Charles, a housing development whose sales office hummed with activity on Sunday, even as the Missouri River was rising.
Cause_General	Although the community is near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, residents are not required to have flood insurance, because they are beyond the 100-year flood plain.
Distant_Anecdotal	The location was a selling point for Ken Snider, a high school teacher from St. Louis.
Distant_Anecdotal	''It's not going to flood here for another 100 years,'' Mr. Snider said, ''and I won't be around by then.''
Distant_Evaluation	But critics of the developments say someone else is likely to be around then, and taxpayers in general will carry the tab after the next disaster bailout.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''If history tells us anything, it's that levees once built eventually fail,'' Professor Pinter said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''But instead of being farmland there, now it's a strip mall or residential area, or a whole city.''
Distant_Historical	The floods of 1993 killed 38 people and caused $16 billion in damage across the Midwest.
Distant_Historical	More than 500 counties were declared federal disaster areas.
Distant_Anecdotal	Adolphus A. Busch IV, a member of the Anheuser-Busch brewing family who helped found the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance in St. Louis in 2000, is alarmed at the pace of development in the rivers' paths after the 1993 flood.
Distant_Anecdotal	''That was the milestone for us,'' Mr. Busch said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''At that point the federal government came in and did major buyouts, and people said, 'Look, we've learned our lesson: no more development.'
Distant_Anecdotal	Well, that lasted for about six or seven years.''
Distant_Anecdotal	He continued, ''We always realized that there would be fringe development, but we never envisioned after 1993 that anyone would try to build major levees and enclose thousands of acres.''
Distant_Evaluation	Some people already living in the flood plain at the time of the last big flood now say that it just makes economic sense for them to stay close to the river, and that it is an issue of personal-risk calculation and property rights.
Distant_Anecdotal	Doris Hulst, a 65-year-old school bus driver, is the sole homeowner on a 109-acre swath of land that once housed three trailer parks near the Missouri River in St. Charles County.
Distant_Anecdotal	''They all took the buyout,'' Mrs. Hulst said of her neighbors who relocated after the flood.
Distant_Anecdotal	''I took the buyout on a trailer I owned across the street, but you didn't make enough money to buy anything decent.''
Distant_Anecdotal	Today, Mrs. Hulst's trailer is elevated on three rows of cinder blocks.
Distant_Anecdotal	''We'll be fine as long as the Mississippi doesn't back up,'' she said.
Distant_Evaluation	Alan Dooley, a spokesman for the Army Corps of Engineers, St. Louis District, said people, like water, had certain natural inclinations.
Distant_Evaluation	''People have a tendency to locate near water,'' Mr. Dooley said.
Distant_Evaluation	''These people vote; they pay taxes.
Distant_Evaluation	It's kind of difficult to go through with a broad brush and say, 'You all ought to get out of here.'

Cause_General	PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Hungry survivors of an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia said on Wednesday they were scavenging for food in farms as President Joko Widodo made a second visit to the area to ramp up aid efforts five days after disaster struck.
Cause_General	The official death toll from the 7.5 magnitude quake that hit the west coast of Sulawesi island last Friday rose to 1,407, many killed by tsunami waves it triggered.
Error	(GRAPHIC: Catastrophe in Sulawesi - tmsnrt.rs/2OqQlUo)
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But officials fear the toll could soar, as most of the confirmed dead have come from Palu, a small city 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of Jakarta, and losses in remote areas remain unknown, as communications are down, and bridges and roads have been destroyed or blocked by landslides.
Distant_Evaluation	National disaster mitigation agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said most of the aid effort had been concentrated in Palu, where electricity supply has yet to be restored.
Distant_Evaluation	But rescue workers have begun to reach more remote areas in a disaster zone that encompasses 1.4 million people.

Distant_Anecdotal	In another part of Donggala district, which has a population of 300,000 people, Ahmad Derajat, said survivors were scavenging for food in fields and orchards.
Distant_Anecdotal	“What we’re relying on right now is food from farms and sharing whatever we find like sweet potatoes or bananas,” said Derajat whose house was swept away by the tsunami leaving a jumble of furniture, collapsed tin roofs and wooden beams.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Why aren’t they dropping aid by helicopter?” he asked.
Distant_Anecdotal	Aid worker Lian Gogali described a perilous situation in Donggala, which includes a string of cut-off, small towns along a coast road north of Palu close to the quake’s epicenter.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Everyone is desperate for food and water.
Distant_Anecdotal	There’s no food, water, or gasoline.
Distant_Anecdotal	The government is missing,” Gogali said, adding that her aid group had only been able to send in a trickle of rations by motorbike.
Main	Underlining a growing sense of urgency, President Widodo made his second visit to the disaster zone, putting on an orange hard hat to talk to rescue workers at a collapsed hotel in Palu.
Distant_Evaluation	“What I’ve observed after returning now is heavy equipment has arrived, logistics have started to arrive although it’s not at maximum yet, fuel has partly arrived,” Widodo told reporters.
Distant_Anecdotal	‘PRESIDENT NOT HEARING’
Distant_Evaluation	Widodo, who will seek re-election next year, called on Tuesday for reinforcements in the search for victims, saying everyone had to be found.
Distant_Evaluation	He repeated that on Wednesday, after inspecting what he called an “evacuation” effort at the Hotel Roa Roa, where he said some 30 people lay buried in the ruins.

Cause_General	At least seven cargo planes arrived at Palu airport earlier on Wednesday carrying tonnes of aid, some bedecked in the red and white national colors and stamped with the presidential office seal declaring: “Assistance from the President of Republic of Indonesia”.
Cause_Specific	The quake brought down hotels, shopping malls and thousands of houses in Palu, while tsunami waves as high as six meters (20 feet) scoured its beachfront shortly afterwards.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	About 1,700 houses in one neighborhood were swallowed up by ground liquefaction, which happens when soil shaken by an earthquake behaves like a liquid, and hundreds of people are believed to have perished, the disaster agency said.
Distant_Evaluation	Indonesian Red Cross disaster responders said the village of Petobo, just south of Palu, which was home to almost 500 people, had been “wiped off the map”.
Distant_Evaluation	“They are finding devastation and tragedy everywhere,” Iris van Deinse, of International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said in a statement.

Main	HAVANA, May 29 (Xinhua) -- Four people have died in Cuba over the last two days due to heavy rains associated with subtropical storm Alberto, which led to massive floods in the island nation's central provinces as well as damage to roads, bridges, houses and state institutions.
Cause_Specific	According to a Cuban state television report, the four victims died due to their imprudence such as walking in flooded areas and swimming in rivers with strong currents.
Main	"""We have four people dead so far, two in the province of Ciego de Avila, one in Sancti Spiritus and another in Villa Clara due to reckless behavior,"" said Interior Minister Julio Gandarilla in a meeting on Tuesday, chaired by the country's president Miguel Diaz-Canel."
Cause_General	Over the last four days, heavy rains have affected the island nation's central provinces, as flood left thousands of homes under water.
Cause_General	Over 51,000 Cubans have been evacuated in the area.
Cause_General	Some 1,384 homes have been affected, with 174 totally collapsed, according to the meeting.
Cause_General	Over 43,000 people remain without electricity in several provinces.
Cause_General	An oil spill was caused by heavy floods at one of the nation's main oil refineries in Cienfuegos.

Main	TOKYO (Reuters) - A powerful typhoon was expected to make landfall in west Japan on Thursday, raising the risk of more hardship for a region battered by deadly floods in July, and prompting authorities to issue evacuation advisories for more than 60,000 people.
Cause_Specific	The center of Typhoon Cimaron was about 60 km (37 miles) south of Shikoku, the smallest of Japan’s four main islands, at 6 p.m. (0900 GMT) and heading north.
Main	It was likely to cut across western Japan on Thursday evening, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.
Cause_Specific	Heavy rains and waves lashed the south eastern coast of Shikoku, according to a live stream on public broadcaster NHK’s web site.
Main_Consequence	Cities in neighboring Osaka and Okayama prefectures issued evacuation advisories for around 85,000 residents, according to NHK.
Main_Consequence	As a precaution, a bullet train service was suspended between Osaka and Hiroshima, western Japan, NHK said.
Main	“There will be heavy rain in areas that have yet to fully recover,” Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said at a meeting of the government’s disaster response headquarters.
Cause_General	“In order to prevent a secondary disaster, do not be afraid of false alarms and evacuate early and do everything you can (to protect yourself),” he added.
Main	Shikoku would likely see as much as 800 mm (32 inches) of rain in the 24 hours to noon on Friday.
Main	Central Japan, including the industrial region of Nagoya, could see up to 600 mm of rain in the same period, the agency said.
Main_Consequence	At least three municipalities on Shikoku issued evacuation advisories for their 65,000 residents and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe urged residents to take precautionary measures early.
Cause_General	Japan has been hit by various extreme weather since the beginning of July with record-breaking heat and the devastating floods and landslides in the west that killed more than 200 people.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	QUESTIONS ABOUT WARNINGS
Distant_Evaluation	Indonesia, which sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, is all too familiar with deadly earthquakes and tsunamis.
Distant_Historical	In 2004, a quake off Sumatra island triggered a tsunami across the Indian Ocean, killing 226,000 people in 13 countries, including more than 120,000 in Indonesia.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Questions are sure to be asked why warning systems set up after that disaster appear to have failed on Friday.
Cause_General	Nugroho, bemoaning a fall in funding, said no tsunami buoys, one type of instrument used to detect the waves, in Indonesia had been operating since 2012.
Distant_Evaluation	The meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG issued a tsunami warning after the quake but lifted it 34 minutes later, drawing criticism it had been too hasty.
Distant_Evaluation	But officials estimated the waves had hit while the warning was in force.
Cause_General	Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on Palu’s beach when the water surged.
Distant_Evaluation	A disaster official said the tsunami traveled across the sea at speeds of 800 kph (500 mph).
Cause_General	Video on social media showed water bearing whirls of debris rushing in as people shouted in alarm and scattered.
Distant_Evaluation	Palu is at the head of a bay, about 10 km long and 2 km wide, which had “amplified” the wave as it was funneled toward the city, a geophysics agency official said.
Distant_Evaluation	The BMKG said its closest tidal gauge sensor, about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu, had only recorded an “insignificant” 6 cm (2.5 inches) wave.
Cause_General	Palu’s airport was damaged in the quake, but had reopened for limited commercial flights, authorities said.
Cause_General	Neighbors including Australia, Thailand and China offered help and Pope Francis, speaking to thousands in St. Peter’s Square, said he was praying for the victims.
Cause_General	The European Union has announced 1.5 million euros ($1.74 million) in immediate aid.
Cause_General	Indonesia has the world’s largest Muslim population but also significant pockets of Christians, including on Sulawesi, which is one of the archipelago nation’s five main islands.
Cause_General	BADDAGANA, Sri Lanka (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - On the surface, Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo looks like any other fast-growing South Asian city, with buildings stretching as far as the eye can see and skyscrapers rearing up along its coast.
Cause_General	But beneath the concrete, Colombo hides a wilder and wetter past.
Distant_Historical	Before it became the nerve center of Sri Lankan politics and business, the city was a region dotted with wetlands and about 30 km (19 miles) of canals that helped absorb and disperse the massive rains that come in from the Indian Ocean.
Cause_General	In the past four decades, as the island adopted an aggressive development policy, its natural flood protection systems were built over, both by authorized and informal construction.
Distant_Evaluation	“Flash flooding is now a frequent thing,” said N. S. Wijayaratne, deputy general manager for wetlands at the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation, a government body.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Experts say Colombo’s long-neglected wetlands could help alleviate worsening floods - and are set to make a comeback as a key pillar of a major flood prevention program.
Cause_Specific	Floods occurred in 2016 and 2017 during the monsoon, and smaller deluges have happened this year even before the onset of the monsoon, including in the past few days.
Cause_Specific	Weather patterns have changed drastically since the 1970s, with rains becoming shorter but more intense, as the planet has warmed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That shift has raised the risk of flooding in the Colombo Metropolitan Area, home to about a quarter of the island nation’s population of 21 million.
Distant_Historical	In November 2010, heavy rains brought the city to a standstill for a week, causing damage worth as much as $100 million, said World Bank consultant Nadeera Rajapakse Rubaroe.
Cause_General	FAST-SHRINKING WETLANDS
Main	The $321-million Metro Colombo Urban Development Project - about two-thirds of it funded by the World Bank - aims to strengthen flood protection and urban planning.
Main	Under the plan, what is left of the city’s wetlands are being revived to retain excess water.
Distant_Historical	Two such areas have been developed in the past three years near a lake close to the city’s parliament building in the eastern suburbs of Baddagana and Diyasaru Thalawathugoda.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Wijayaratne said at least 10 more locations around the lake can be developed into similar parkland.
Distant_Evaluation	There is no time to lose, say experts.
Distant_Evaluation	“In terms of flood protection and mitigation, the wetlands in Colombo play an indispensable role, and are at an absolutely critical threshold,” the World Bank’s Rubaroe said.
Cause_General	The city has been losing its wetlands at an alarming rate, she added.
Cause_General	Only about 17 percent of Colombo’s territory consists of wetlands that have not been encroached on, covering some 20 square km combined.
Cause_General	That surface area can retain close to 40 percent of the rainfall the area receives annually - the equivalent of 27,000 Olympic swimming pools of water.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If Colombo were to lose all its wetlands, flooding would shave off about 1 percent of its annual gross domestic product of some $53 billion, according to a World Bank study.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Projections by the bank and the government show that without the wetlands, major floods like the one in 2010 – which rose as high as 5 meters (16 ft) in some areas - could be 1.8 meters higher.
Distant_Evaluation	PEOPLE’S PARKS
Distant_Evaluation	To be successful, experts say city communities must have a say in - and gain from - the rehabilitation of the wetlands.
Distant_Evaluation	“People have to feel part and parcel of the project - they need to experience that these projects make very real changes to their lives,” said Sameera Premarathana, manager at Baddagana Park, which offers a nature trail for the public.
Cause_General	The plan aims to develop the revivable wetlands around the parliament lake so that they offer recreational, tourist and other benefits, rather than leaving the land unused.
Distant_Evaluation	Premarathana said that when Baddagana Park first opened, local people showed little interest, and some even blamed the park for adding to floods in the area.
Distant_Evaluation	But after the incidence of flooding reduced to almost nothing, they started to grasp the importance of the park, its manager said.
Cause_General	Local residents have also earned money from running the car park and providing refreshments for visitors, who number some 7,000 a month.
Cause_General	The green space has become popular with school children on educational tours, with some joining the park conservation society.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Premarathana noted the full tourist potential of Colombo’s wetlands has been assessed at about 2 billion rupees ($12.7 million) per year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Wijayaratne of the Land Reclamation and Development Corporation said the wetland restoration projects would incorporate leisure and educational activities while ensuring rainwater run-off can still flow freely through the area.
Distant_Evaluation	“The wellbeing of people in Colombo - especially in terms of flood protection - depends on its existing wetlands, and they need to be preserved and used wisely (and) sustainably as part and parcel of city development,” said Rubaroe.
Main	MEXICO BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Searchers on Friday uncovered the first body in the rubble of the Florida town of Mexico Beach, which was nearly obliterated by Hurricane Michael, as the toll from the historic storm rose to at least 18 and was expected to climb further.
Cause_General	Rescue teams, hampered by power and telephone outages, used cadaver dogs, drones and heavy equipment to hunt for hundreds of people unaccounted for in devastated communities across the Florida Panhandle.
Distant_Evaluation	“I’ve watched on television, thinking of what others have experienced, like in the Carolinas and Texas,” Mexico Beach Mayor Al Cathey told reporters referring to earlier hurricanes.
Distant_Evaluation	“But it’s different when you walk down and see this, and your emotions run away.
Distant_Evaluation	This is just a small unique coastal community.”
Cause_General	No other information was available about the dead man found in Mexico Beach, said Joseph Zahralban, Miami’s fire chief who was leading a search and rescue unit.
Distant_Evaluation	He said it was unclear if the man lived alone or with a family.
Main	Three deaths were reported in Marianna, in Jackson County, Florida, Sheriff Lou Roberts told a news conference on Friday afternoon.
Main	Florida accounts for nine of the storm-related deaths, with five more in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The death toll is expected to rise as rescuers go house-to-house and comb through the rubble in Mexico Beach and other Florida coastal communities, such as Port St. Joe and Panama City, said Brock Long, administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Cause_General	The Houston-based volunteer search-and-rescue network CrowdSource Rescue said its teams were trying to find about 2,100 people either reported missing or stranded and in need of help in Florida, co-founder Matthew Marchetti said.
Cause_General	Social media websites were crowded with messages from those trying to reach missing family in Florida’s Bay and Gulf Counties.
Cause_General	Marchetti said his volunteer search teams, consisting mostly of off-duty police officers and firefighters, also had rescued or accounted for 345 others previously reported to CrowdSource Rescue since Michael struck on Wednesday.
Cause_General	DOGS AND BULLDOZERS
Cause_General	FEMA crews have been using bulldozers and other heavy equipment to push a path through debris so rescuers can sift the rubble using specially trained search dogs.
Cause_General	More than 1,700 search and rescue workers have been deployed, Governor Rick Scott’s office said in a statement, including seven swift-water rescue teams and nearly 300 ambulances.
Cause_Specific	Michael crashed ashore near Mexico Beach on Wednesday afternoon as one of the most powerful storms in U.S. history, with winds of up to 155 mph (250 kph).
Cause_Specific	It pushed a wall of seawater inland, causing widespread flooding.
Cause_Specific	The tropical storm, which grew in less than two days into a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, tore apart entire neighborhoods in the Panhandle, reducing homes to naked concrete foundations or piles of wood and siding.
Error	Damaged and destroyed buildings are seen in an aerial photograph, taken during a post-Hurricane Michael flight by a U.S. Coast Guard MH-65 helicopter over Mexico Beach, Florida, U.S. October 11, 2018.

Cause_General	Except for the emergency 911 system, authorities in Bay County, the epicenter of the disaster, were virtually without telephone or internet service until late on Friday, making communications internally and with the public difficult.
Distant_Evaluation	“We didn’t have anything,” said Ruth Corley, a spokeswoman for the Bay County Sheriff’s Department.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’ve been writing things down on pieces of paper.
Distant_Evaluation	We’re doing what we can with the minimal media that we have.”
Cause_General	She said local television stations were knocked off the air for two days, and authorities were relying on the Gulf State College radio station to transmit public service bulletins.
Cause_General	Search teams went door-to-door hunting victims.
Distant_Evaluation	REBUILD RIGHT
Cause_General	FEMA’s Long urged communities such as Mexico Beach, where many homes were pulverized by 12 to 14 feet (3.7 to 4.3 meters) of storm surge, to rebuild to withstand future storms.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s OK if you want to live on the coast or on top of a mountain that sees wildfires or whatever, but you have to build to a higher standard,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“If we’re going to rebuild, do it right.”
Cause_General	By Friday morning the storm remnants were about 275 miles (445 km) southwest of Nantucket, Massachusetts, packing maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 kph).
Cause_General	More than 940,000 homes and businesses on the U.S. East Coast were without power and it could be weeks before power is restored to the most damaged parts of Florida.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The numbers in emergency shelters were expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by Friday, said Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross.
Cause_General	The Coast Guard said it rescued 129 people.

Distant_Evaluation	NANCHANG, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Holding a smartphone in his hand, He Xuehao, director of the flood control office in Anqing City, China's Anhui Province, knows everything about the city's real-time precipitation and hydrologic conditions.
Cause_General	Anqing is situated in the lower reaches of the Yangtze, China's longest river.
Distant_Evaluation	Every summer, flood season arrives just in time to worry flood control officials like He.
Distant_Historical	In the summer of 1998, China's Yangtze River flooded, causing more than 1,000 deaths.
Cause_General	Determining rising water levels is one of the biggest challenges for the flood control office.
Distant_Evaluation	He still remembers that 20 years ago, when he was 16 years old, he had to patrol dikes every two hours, with a bamboo pole, a flashlight, and an umbrella, for days on end.
Distant_Historical	"""I had to row a boat and even swim to the mid-stream to measure water levels."
Distant_Evaluation	"It was troublesome and extremely dangerous,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	Thanks to the advancement of technology in flood control, officials like He no longer have to risk their lives to measure water levels.
Main	"""The automatic observation and flood prediction system achieves full coverage of the Yangtze -- the mainstream, primary tributaries, large reservoirs, key medium reservoirs and lakes along the river,"" He said."
Cause_Specific	In Anqing alone, more than 600 stations measure and report rainfall automatically, and 210 water level gauging stations provide precise and timely monitoring data, which helps officials form and implement emergency plans.
Cause_Specific	In addition, a series of flood control equipment has been put into use.
Distant_Historical	"In 2016, a collapsible mobile ""water plugging wall"" with a waterproof canvas bag at its core was used to fill dike breaches in Anqing."
Cause_General	"In just 10 minutes, the ""wall"" can swell up to six meters, serving as a water barrier."
Distant_Evaluation	"""China has comprehensively strengthened its flood resistance ability in the past 20 years,"" He said."
Distant_Historical	In 2010, flood control headquarters in neighboring Jiangxi Province used satellite remote sensing to evaluate flood situations and dispatch rescue teams to the worst-hit areas.
Distant_Historical	Two years later, drones were used to monitor water levels.
Cause_Specific	This year, the province purchased five units of drainage equipment that can adapt to different environments such as cities and farmland.
Cause_Specific	Seven remote-control rescue robots also came into service in Jiangxi.
Cause_General	Shaped like lifeboats, these robots can evacuate three to four people stranded by the flood and deliver relief supplies.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We have set up a compete flood prevention communication system, which can automatically send warning messages to residents once it detects a potential risk of flood,"" said Wang Bin, secretary general of Huaihe River Flood Control Headquarters."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Technology improves prediction accuracy, increases rescue efficiency, and reduces losses caused by flooding."""
Cause_General	Huaihe is another flood-prone river that originates from central China's Henan Province.
Distant_Evaluation	With the advanced flood observation system and the introduction of cutting-edge equipment, floods are no longer as life-threatening as they were before, He added.

Main	By midweek, there had been more than 5,146 registrations statewide for assistance, more than two-thirds -- 3,507 -- from Westchester.
Main	More than $7 million in assistance had been distributed statewide, Mr. Alejandre said, about $5.9 million for housing assistance, most of it in Westchester.
Main	He said 19 loans had been approved by the federal Small Business Administration for more than $1 million statewide.
Distant_Evaluation	He attributed the small number of loans to the fact that many of the applications sent out to businesses seeking assistance had not been returned.
Cause_General	He noted that residents who are denied assistance can appeal the decision.
Main	Help in resubmitting applications is being offered at three disaster recovery centers, in Mamaroneck, Eastchester and New Rochelle.
Cause_General	The last day to sign up to receive aid is June 23, Mr. Alejandre said.
Main	Additional outreach is being conducted by FEMA and the State Emergency Management Office at Home Depot stores in two Westchester locations: 601 Sprain Road in Yonkers and 150 Midland Avenue in Port Chester.
Cause_General	Today is the last day FEMA outreach workers will be there to answer questions about flood cleanup and how to prepare for future flooding.
Main	Fletcher Jackson, a FEMA community outreach representative working at the Home Depot in Yonkers, said about 60 to 100 people a day were stopping at the information table.
Cause_General	About half had sustained flood damage in the April 15 storm.
Distant_Evaluation	''We want people to be better prepared,'' Mr. Alejandre said.
Distant_Evaluation	''The question is not if there will be another event, but when.''
Cause_General	Sewage Danger Is Over In Hudson, Officials Say
Cause_General	County health officials on Thursday lifted a warning cautioning people to stay out of the Hudson River, six days after a pipe ruptured in Yonkers, releasing more than 7.5 million gallons of raw sewage into the river.
Distant_Evaluation	''We haven't had a spill of this size for half a dozen years,'' said Mary Landrigan, a spokeswoman with the county Health Department.
Cause_General	The spill occurred May 4 when a 48-inch concrete pipe broke after a hillside, weakened by heavy rainfall in April, collapsed.
Cause_General	The break occurred just north of the Greystone train station, contaminating water from the northern end of the Bronx, through Westchester and into southern Rockland County.
Distant_Evaluation	Ms. Landrigan said contact with the contaminated water could lead to stomach cramps, vomiting and diarrhea, although no cases had been reported by late last week.
Distant_Evaluation	The leak was fixed within days, and Ms. Landrigan said tidal action and the large volume of water in the river would disperse the sewage.
Cause_General	Drinking water was not affected.
Cause_General	However, an additional half million gallons of sewage flowed into a nearby wetland.
Cause_General	State environmental officials said they were examining the impact to determine whether a cleanup would be necessary.
Error	THE WEEK
Main	MAZATLAN, Mexico (Reuters) - Hurricane Willa slammed into Mexico’s Pacific coast late on Tuesday, raking it with winds of 120 mph (195 kph) that brought power outages, buffeted buildings, and dumped torrential rain on tourist resorts where thousands of people had moved to safety.
Main	Whipping palm trees, bending power lines and causing floods, the center of Willa struck the coast near the town of Isla del Bosque in the northwestern state of Sinaloa, where many coastal areas had been evacuated before the storm hit.
Cause_General	Willa, a Category 3 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale was one of the most powerful hurricanes to hit Mexico from the Pacific in recent years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It was due to dissipate fast as it moved inland, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
Distant_Evaluation	“It was really strong,” said Cecilia Crespo, a spokeswoman for police in Escuinapa, a seaside town near to where the storm plowed inland.
Distant_Evaluation	“It knocked down trees, lamps, poles, walls,” she added by telephone.
Distant_Evaluation	“There’s no electricity.”
Main	The storm drove into Mexico about 50 miles (80 km) south of Mazatlan, a major city and tourist resort in Sinaloa.
Cause_Specific	Willa had reached rare Category 5 status on Monday with winds near 160 mph (260 kph) before it began to lose power.
Cause_General	Willa weakened as it moved inland but was still blowing winds of 115 mph (185 kph) more than an hour after it struck the coast and began advancing toward the state of Durango.
Distant_Anecdotal	Speaking by telephone, Jose Garcia, another resident of the hardest-hit area, said he had hunkered down with others in an Escuinapa hotel waiting for the storm to pass, listening to it rattle buildings as it drove onwards.
Distant_Anecdotal	“People were very alarmed,” the 60-year-old said.
Distant_Evaluation	The storm did not strike hard in Mazatlan’s historic city center, which was nearly deserted ahead of its arrival.
Distant_Anecdotal	“My house is made of sheet metal, wood and cardboard, and I’m scared it will fall on top of me,” said Rosa Maria Carrillo, 36, at a city shelter with her five children, aged 8 to 15.
Cause_General	Several other tourist getaways in the state of Nayarit, as well as the beach resort of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco state, were close to Willa’s path, which was forecast to bring a life-threatening storm surge of ocean water, wind and rainfall.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Up to 18 inches (45 cm) of rainfall could pummel parts of the storm zone, the Miami-based hurricane center said.
Error	Slideshow (31 Images)
Cause_General	The flood risk was compounded by rains caused by Vicente, a storm that dissipated early on Tuesday, having drenched parts of Jalisco, Colima, Michoacan and Guerrero states.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Nayarit’s government said it would continue to suspend classes across 10 municipalities on Wednesday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Even buildings up to 500 meters (1,640 feet) distant from the coastline could lose power and suffer physical damage, Mexico’s National Meteorological Service said.
Main	PANAMA CITY, Fla. (Reuters) - Hurricane Michael, the fiercest storm to hit Florida in 80 years and the third-most powerful ever to strike the U.S. mainland, battered the state’s Gulf coast with roof-shredding winds, raging surf and torrential rains before turning its diminishing fury on Georgia.
Main	Michael, whose rapid intensification as it churned north over the Gulf of Mexico caught many by surprise, made landfall on Wednesday afternoon near Mexico Beach, about 20 miles (32 km) southeast of Panama City in Florida’s Panhandle region, with top sustained winds reaching 155 miles per hour (249 kph).
Main	The storm came ashore as a Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale, the biggest storm on record to strike the Florida Panhandle.
Main	Its sustained winds were just 2 mph (3.2 kph) shy of an extremely rare Category 5.
Cause_General	The storm’s intensity waned steadily as it pushed inland and curled northeasterly into Georgia after dark.
Cause_General	It was downgraded to a Category 1 storm, with top sustained winds diminishing to 75 miles per hour (120 kph), about nine hours after it made landfall.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The governors of North and South Carolina urged residents to brace for more heavy rain and storm-force winds as Michael plows northward up the Atlantic seaboard.
Cause_General	The Carolinas are still reeling from severe flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence less than a month ago.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The National Hurricane Center said Michael would pass through the Carolinas as a tropical storm on Thursday, dumping as much as 8 inches of rain in some areas.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Up to a foot (30 cm) of rain was forecast in Florida.
Main_Consequence	Gadsden County sheriff’s spokeswoman Anglie Hightower said a “male subject” was killed by a tree toppling onto his house in Greensboro, Florida, near the state capital, Tallahassee, in the first report of a fatality from the hurricane.
Main_Consequence	Severe flooding, heavily damaged buildings, uprooted trees and downed power lines appeared widespread in coastal areas near the storm’s landfall.
Main_Consequence	Television news footage during the day showed many homes submerged in floodwaters up to their roofs in Mexico Beach, where the fate of about 280 residents who authorities said defied evacuation orders was unknown.
Main_Consequence	Numerous buildings in Panama City were demolished, partially collapsed or without roofs amid deserted streets littered with debris, twisted, fallen tree trunks and dangling wires.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Authorities said the full extent of devastation would not be known until after daybreak on Thursday.
Main_Consequence	In the meantime, curfews were imposed across much of the region.
Distant_Anecdotal	Bill Manning, a 63-year-old grocery clerk, fled his camper van in Panama City for safer quarters in a hotel only to see the electricity there go out.
Distant_Anecdotal	“My God, it’s scary.
Distant_Anecdotal	I didn’t expect all this,” he said.
Main_Consequence	Without power, the city was plunged into darkness at nightfall and its flooded streets were mostly silent and devoid of people or traffic.
Main_Consequence	By Wednesday night, more than 403,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in Florida, Georgia and Alabama, utility companies said.
Distant_Evaluation	‘ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE’
Main_Consequence	Twenty miles south of Mexico Beach, floodwaters were more than 7-1/2 feet (2.3 meters) deep near Apalachicola, a town of about 2,300 residents, hurricane center chief Ken Graham said.
Cause_General	Wind damage was also evident.
Distant_Evaluation	“There are so many downed power lines and trees that it’s almost impossible to get through the city,” Apalachicola Mayor Van Johnson said.

Cause_General	The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said on Tuesday an estimated 500,000 Florida residents had been ordered or urged to seek higher ground before the storm in 20 counties spanning a 200-mile (320-km) stretch of shoreline.
Distant_Evaluation	But Brad Kieserman of the American Red Cross said on Wednesday as many as 320,000 people on Florida’s Gulf Coast had disregarded evacuation notices.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	An estimated 6,000 evacuees took cover in emergency shelters, most of them in Florida, and that number was expected to swell to 20,000 across five states by week’s end, Kieserman said.
Distant_Evaluation	Bo Patterson, the mayor of Port St. Joe, just south of Mexico Beach, rode out the storm in his house seven blocks from the beach, describing the scene outside as “very, very scary.”
Cause_General	He was one of about 2,500 of the town’s 3,500 residents who ended up staying put, many of them caught off guard by the storm’s rapid escalation as it approached.
Distant_Evaluation	“This happened so quickly,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	FEMA head Brock Long acknowledged that early evacuation efforts in the area were slow in comparison to how quickly the hurricane intensified.
Cause_General	Michael grew from a tropical storm into a Category 4 hurricane over the course of about 40 hours.
Distant_Evaluation	“Satellite images of Michael’s evolution on Tuesday night were, in a word, jaw-dropping,” wrote Bob Henson, a meteorologist with weather site Weather Underground.
Cause_General	With a low barometric pressure recorded at 919 millibars, the measure of a hurricane’s force, Michael ranked as the third-strongest storm on record to make landfall in the continental United States.
Distant_Historical	Only Hurricane Camille on the Mississippi Gulf Coast in 1969 and the so-called Labor Day hurricane of 1935 in the Florida Keys were more intense.
Main_Consequence	President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for all of Florida, freeing up federal assistance to supplement state and local disaster responses.
Main_Consequence	About 3,500 Florida National Guard troops were deployed to assist with evacuations and storm recovery, along with more than 1,000 search-and-rescue personnel, Governor Rick Scott said.

Main_Consequence	The Pentagon said it had pre-positioned more than 2,200 active-duty military personnel, along with helicopters, high-water vehicles and swift-water boats for deployment as needed.
Cause_General	Even before landfall, the hurricane disrupted energy operations in the Gulf, cutting crude oil production by more than 40 percent and natural gas output by nearly a third as offshore platforms were evacuated ahead of the storm’s arrival.
Main	PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - A week after Hurricane Michael battered Florida’s Gulf Coast with record fury, the full extent of devastation and loss of life remained unclear on Wednesday, as disruptions to phone, power and transportation systems hindered the disaster recovery.

Cause_Specific	At least 30 people were killed, according to local authorities, when Michael plowed ashore as one of the fiercest hurricanes on record to strike the U.S. mainland, pulverizing a cluster of seaside towns along Florida’s northwestern Panhandle region.
Main	Seven days later search crews continued combing through the wreckage of demolished neighborhoods looking for any sign of additional victims in Panama City Beach, Mexico Beach and Port St. Joe, the communities closest to the storm’s landfall.
Main	Distribution of food and water to storm-stricken residents farther inland has been slowed by communication outages and storm-shattered roads blocked by toppled trees, power lines and other debris.
Cause_General	Florida officials have not said how many people may be missing.
Cause_General	Teams of volunteers with the Houston-based CrowdSource Rescue organization were trying to reach more than 700 Florida residents reported unaccounted for by worried relatives and friends, said Matthew Marchetti, the organization’s co-founder.
Cause_General	Most of that number, down from 2,100 people the group was trying to locate in the immediate aftermath of the storm, are from Panama City and many of them are elderly, disabled, impoverished or living alone, Marchetti said.
Main	He said the search had been hampered by spotty cell phone service in the devastated area, though authorities were making progress in restoring communications.
Distant_Evaluation	High volumes of missing persons reports are not uncommon in the days following a natural disaster because so many survivors fail to check in with loved ones right away or lack the means to do so because of phone and power outages, authorities said.
Cause_General	Nevertheless, at least 48,000 Florida residents in the 12 counties hardest hit by Hurricane Michael had registered for disaster assistance as of Wednesday with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA spokesman Ruben Brown told Reuters.
Cause_General	That number represents about 7 percent of the population of the 12 counties designated by President Donald Trump’s federal disaster declaration as eligible for FEMA aid to individuals and households.
Cause_General	Nearly a third, or more than 15,000 people, reported storm damage to their homes when they signed up with FEMA, though the full scope of property losses remained to be seen, Brown said.
Cause_General	As of Wednesday, 286 families left homeless by the storm in Bay County, at the epicenter of the disaster, were approved for FEMA-furnished hotel vouchers, he said.
Cause_General	Florida accounted for 20 of the known fatalities attributed to Hurricane Michael, with six more in Virginia, three in North Carolina and one in Georgia, according to a Reuters tally of reports from county officials along the path of the storm.
Cause_General	Officials said medical examiners were determining whether another four deaths in Florida were storm-related.
Cause_General	As of Tuesday, FEMA had distributed about 4.5 million meals, more than 5 million liters of water and 9 million infant-and-toddler kits, Brown said.
Cause_General	The state government was distributing ice, water and about 3 million ready-to-eat meals, Governor Rick Scott’s office said.

Cause_General	Nearly 155,000 homes and businesses remained without power in the U.S. Southeast, with residents of battered coastal towns forced to cook on fires and barbecue grills.
Cause_General	At least 70 percent of customers in four mainly rural Florida Panhandle counties were without electricity on Wednesday.
Cause_General	On Tuesday, the federal government said that 61.5 percent of cell sites remained out of service in Bay County.

Main_Consequence	CHONGQING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100,000 residents were temporarily evacuated as a flood peak passed the city proper of southwest China's Chongqing Municipality on Saturday.
Main	Water levels in the Jialing and Yangtze rivers exceeded the warning levels by 5.92 meters and 3.78 meters, respectively, as flood peaks passed the city, according to the municipal flood control and drought relief headquarters.
Cause_Specific	Heavy rain in the upper reaches of the Yangtze, Jialing, and Fujiang rivers caused the worst floods since 2012 in the region.
Main_Consequence	The municipality has coordinated multiple dams, including Three Georges, to discharge flood water, issued warnings, and organized the evacuation of residents to minimize the losses caused by the floods.
Main_Consequence	The Ministry of Emergency Management has also sent emergency relief supplies to severely flooded areas in Sichuan and Gansu provinces Friday, including 8,000 tents, 8,000 folding beds, and 50,000 coats and quilts.
Main_Consequence	The ministry also dispatched teams to flood-hit areas including Deyang, Sichuan Province, and Dingxi, Gansu Province, to coordinate the rescue efforts.
Cause_General	Heavy rain has also damaged farm and aquatic products, as well as facilities including vegetable greenhouses and livestock housing, and destructed farmlands and fishponds in Sichuan, according to the provincial agricultural department.
Main_Consequence	Over 1.87 million people have also been affected by flood in Gansu Province, with 14 dead, 4 missing, and 31,600 residents relocated.
Main_Consequence	Heavy rainstorms also triggered a landslide Thursday in Nanyu village, Zhouqu County, but no casualties have been reported so far.
Distant_Anecdotal	RIKUZENTAKATA, Japan (Reuters) - When a massive earthquake struck in 2011, Japanese oyster fisherman Atsushi Fujita was working as usual by the sea.
Distant_Historical	Soon after, a huge black wave slammed into his city and killed nearly 2,000 people.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Seven years on, Fujita and thousands like him along Japan’s northeast coast have rebuilt their lives alongside huge sea walls that experts say will protect them if another giant tsunami, which some see as inevitable in a seismically active nation like Japan, was to strike.
Cause_Specific	The 12.5-meter (41-ft) concrete wall replaced a 4-meter breakwater that was swamped in the March 11, 2011 disaster.
Distant_Historical	The earthquake and tsunami, which reached as high as 30 meters in some areas, killed nearly 18,000 people across Japan and triggered a nuclear meltdown at the Fukushima power plant.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It feels like we’re in jail, even though we haven’t done anything bad,” the 52-year-old Fujita said.
Error	(Click reut.rs/2oT9XTa to see a picture package of the sea walls built after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.)
Cause_General	Since the disaster, some towns have forbidden construction in flat areas nearest the coast and have relocated residents to higher land.
Cause_General	Others, such as Rikuzentakata, have raised the level of their land by several meters before constructing new buildings.
Cause_Specific	A common thread, though, is the construction of seawalls to replace breakwaters that were overwhelmed by the tsunami.
Cause_General	Some 395 km (245 miles) of walls have been built at a cost of 1.35 trillion yen ($12.74 billion).
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The seawalls will halt tsunamis and prevent them from inundating the land,” said Hiroyasu Kawai, researcher at the Port and Airport Research Institute in Yokosuka, near Tokyo.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Even if the tsunami is bigger than the wall, the wall will delay flooding and guarantee more time for evacuation.”

Cause_General	ADJUSTING
Main	Many residents initially welcomed the idea of the walls but have become more critical over time.
Main	Some say they were not consulted enough in the planning stages or that money spent on the walls has meant that other rebuilding, such as housing, has fallen behind.
Main	Others worry the walls will damage tourism.
Distant_Anecdotal	“About 50 years ago, we came up here with the kids and enjoyed drives along the beautiful ocean and bays,” said Reiko Iijima, a tourist from central Japan, who was eating at an oyster restaurant across from the seawall.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Now, there’s not even a trace of that.”
Cause_General	Part of a wall in the city of Kesennuma, further south, has windows in it - but these, too, draw complaints.
Distant_Anecdotal	“They’re a parody,” said Yuichiro Ito, who lost his home and younger brother in the tsunami.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It’s just to keep us happy with something we never wanted in the first place.”
Distant_Anecdotal	Fisherman Fujita said that while the tsunami had improved oyster farming in the area by stirring up sea floors and removing accumulated sludge, the sea walls could block natural water flows from the land and impact future production.
Cause_General	Many municipalities said the giant walls had to be in place before permission could be granted for reconstruction elsewhere.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I can’t say things like ‘the wall should be lower’ or ‘we don’t need it,’” said Katsuhiro Hatakeyama, who has rebuilt his bed and breakfast business in the same location as before.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It’s thanks to the wall that I could rebuild, and now have a job.”

Main	THIRUVANANTHAPURAM, India, Aug. 25 (Xinhua) -- A blame game has begun between India's two southern states - Kerala and Tamil Nadu over the cause of the devastating floods which claimed nearly 370 lives and left over 1.3 million people homeless in Kerala.
Cause_Specific	The government of Kerala told the country's apex court - Supreme Court of India, on Friday that the floods occurred because its neighboring state Tamil Nadu released water from its Mullaperiyar dam.
Cause_Specific	"The sudden release of water caused an ""overload"" in the Idukki reservoir, in Kerala, downstream and water had to be released, Kerala said in an affidavit in the Supreme Court, filed in response to a petition that wanted a reduction of water level at the Mullaperiyar dam."
Distant_Evaluation	"In its petition, Kerala stated that it had repeatedly suggested to Tamil Nadu to ""gradually"" release water from Mullaperiyar dam, but the latter did not pay heed to it."
Cause_Specific	Tamil Nadu contended that it released water on Aug. 16, nearly a week after floods situation erupted in Kerala, which was battered by torrential rains since Aug. 8 that partly led to the worst ever monsoons in a century.
Cause_Specific	In its counter-affidavit submitted before the apex court, Tamil Nadu government stated that the volume of water released from its Mullaperiyar dam to Idukki dam in Kerala was far less than the quantity exceeded by Idukki and Idamalaiyar dams (in Kerala).
Cause_General	The next date of hearing is scheduled for Sept. 6.
Distant_Evaluation	"Meanwhile, those affected by the deluge said water suddenly gushed into their homes in the wee hours of Aug. 15 when they were still asleep, and that there was ""no prior warning"" from the state administration."
Distant_Anecdotal	K.A.
Distant_Anecdotal	Jose, a resident of Chengannur area of flood-affected Alappuzha district, told Xinhua that he and his wife heard water coming into their home on the night of Aug. 14-15, first through the sewerage system and then from beneath the doors.
Distant_Anecdotal	His house is located on the banks of Pampa river which is connected to Kakki and Pampa dams situated in the state.
Distant_Evaluation	But the state's Water Resources Minister Mathew Thomas said they had issued the warning through television and radio media alerting the people about the impending floods.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We had issued floods warning on the night of August 14-15, but then everything happened so fast,"" the minister told Xinhua."
Main	Mobile homes worth hundreds of millions of dollars are deteriorating in a muddy field in Arkansas and may never be used to house victims of Hurricane Katrina because of a dispute over where to install them, federal officials acknowledged Monday.
Cause_General	Only about 2,700 of the 25,000 mobile homes ordered at a cost of $850 million have been installed, and at least 10,000 are sitting in Hope, Ark., according to documents and statements from Federal Emergency Management Agency officials.
Cause_Specific	Though about 55,000 Louisiana families are still waiting for a manufactured housing unit, the mobile homes may never be used because FEMA regulations prohibit them from being installed in flood-prone coastal areas, federal officials said.
Distant_Evaluation	Members of a Senate committee investigating the response to Hurricane Katrina called the mobile home episode an appalling example of government stumbling.
Distant_Evaluation	''These trailers are going to take the place of those very expensive toilet seats that we remember from Pentagon days,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's really absolutely unbelievable, and unacceptable.''
Distant_Evaluation	In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA ordered far too many mobile homes and too few travel trailers, which are smaller, less expensive and more portable, and can be placed on lots in the disaster zone.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The federal government had expected that Louisiana officials would identify sites inland where the mobile homes could be placed.
Cause_General	But so far, with just a few exceptions, they has not done so, officials said.
Main	''If sites for those mobile homes are not approved in Louisiana, it is possible they will never be used for hurricane relief,'' said Nicol Andrews, a FEMA spokesman.
Cause_General	The report on the mobile homes, as well as widespread fraud in FEMA's emergency assistance to hurricane victims, came as the federal government's top three domestic security and disaster relief officials vowed to fix flaws in the nation's emergency response programs.
Distant_Evaluation	''I am accountable and accept responsibility for the performance of the entire department, good and bad,'' the homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, told local and state disaster officials at a conference in Alexandria, Va. ''I also have the responsibility to fix what went wrong.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The changes will include a cadre of new disaster response workers who will be available to respond quickly to any natural disaster or terrorist attack, Mr. Chertoff said, which could number as many as 1,500, a department official said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Homeland Security Department is also setting up specialized reconnaissance teams -- with access to helicopters, airplanes and high-tech electronic equipment that can send live video feeds to Washington -- to make sure officials know what is going on in a disaster zone.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Chertoff and R. David Paulison, the acting FEMA director, and Frances Fragos Townsend, President Bush's domestic security adviser, also promised to revise rules on debris removal and temporary housing, so local and state governments could move faster to clean up after a disaster and house the homeless.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Chertoff, Mr. Paulison and Ms. Townsend, repeating plans Mr. Chertoff outlined last year, also said they would improve communications systems and the registration process for disaster victims, so there would be fewer delays in getting help for those most in need.
Distant_Evaluation	''Hurricane Katrina is a defining moment in the history of emergency management,'' Mr. Paulison said at the conference, organized by the National Emergency Management Association.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Ms. Townsend, who at the request of Mr. Bush has been conducting her own investigation into the government's response to Hurricane Katrina, said she would issue a report by the end of the month that would have more than 100 recommendations for improving disaster response.
Distant_Evaluation	''We must restore and re-earn your confidence and trust,'' she told the local and state officials, ''so that when somebody says 'I am from the federal government and I am here to help,' you can believe it and not laugh.''
Cause_General	Back in Washington, members of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee were learning of problems still unfolding.
Cause_General	To date, about 72,000 travel trailers have been installed and occupied, of the roughly 100,000 that have been bought.
Cause_General	Mr. Paulison said the agency was moving to order 10,000 more of the units, which cost about $10,000 each, while mobile homes cost on average $34,000.
Distant_Evaluation	FEMA officials said that they had installed both trailers and mobile homes after previous disasters and that they had no reason to believe that Hurricane Katrina would be different.
Distant_Evaluation	But Bill Croft, coordinator for the hurricane housing task force in Louisiana, said federal officials should have realized that many hard-hit communities are in a flood plain, where a federal regulation bans mobile homes.
Distant_Evaluation	''They are the ones who make these rules,'' Mr. Croft said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He suggested that FEMA relax the regulation to allow the mobile homes near the coast.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Another alternative would involve having the federal government pay Louisiana for the full cost of providing services if large, so-called FEMAvilles with hundreds of mobile homes were created in rural or suburban areas.
Distant_Evaluation	Ms. Andrews, the FEMA spokeswoman, said that relaxing the flood-plain regulation was not the answer.
Distant_Evaluation	''There are areas throughout Louisiana and the southeastern United States that aren't in a flood plain,'' she said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As it stands, Richard L. Skinner, inspector general at the Homeland Security Department, told the Senate panel, many of the mobile homes might have to be sold as surplus, stored for some future disaster use or given to another federal agency.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''If they're sold as surplus property, what kind of return can you expect on that?''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, asked Mr. Skinner.
Distant_Evaluation	His answer infuriated the panelmembers.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''It's certainly not going to be very high,'' he responded, given the way they were being stored at a spot where some are sinking into the mud.
Distant_Evaluation	''Some of the trailers that we inspected are actually warping, have lost wheels, and some have been cannibalized, parts taken out, and we don't even know where the parts are right now.
Distant_Evaluation	So their value is going to decrease tremendously.''

Main	KATOWICE, Poland (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The devastation caused by powerful storms is a growing threat to both poor and rich nations, propelling Caribbean islands to the top of a global index of countries most severely affected by weather disasters last year, researchers said on Tuesday.
Distant_Historical	The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico was ranked as the hardest-hit and the island of Dominica came in third place after both were battered by Hurricane Maria last September, according to an annual climate risk index from Germanwatch, an environmental policy group.
Distant_Historical	The United States ranked 12th in the 2017 index, with 389 fatalities and nearly $175 billion in losses from extreme weather.
Distant_Evaluation	“Recent storms with intensity levels never seen before have had disastrous impacts,” said the index’s lead author David Eckstein.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Such weather disasters are likely to worsen further in coming years, the United Nations’ humanitarian agency warned on Tuesday, creating significant new humanitarian needs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Floods, storms and droughts all are expected to strengthen, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its “Global Humanitarian Overview 2019” report.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It cited World Bank data predicting 140 million people could be internally displaced by 2050 as a result of global warming.
Cause_General	Among the countries being significantly hit by climate-linked extreme weather is the United States, whose President Donald Trump is one of the most prominent skeptics of man-made climate change, the agency said.
Distant_Historical	Hurricanes and storms in the United States and Caribbean caused more than $220 billion dollars worth of damage last year, representing nearly two thirds of global losses caused by natural disasters in 2017, OCHA said.
Distant_Evaluation	“Climate events are contributing to greater humanitarian problems than we have seen in the past,” said Jens Laerke, a spokesman for OCHA.
Distant_Evaluation	“This is something the world has not yet adapted fully to.”
Main	As hurricanes and tropical cyclones intensify in strength, they are particularly hurting poor nations that are unprepared for the threat, researchers said on the sidelines of U.N. climate talks in Poland.
Distant_Historical	In the tiny island country of Dominica, Maria caused losses equal to more than twice its gross domestic product, damaging or destroying about 90 percent of housing.
Distant_Evaluation	Lloyd Pascal, a Dominican climate negotiator whose home has yet to be fully repaired after being hit by the storm, urged the U.N. talks to pay more attention to “weaker countries”.
Distant_Evaluation	Dominica, with 72,000 people, lacks the ability to prepare for the increasingly severe weather it is suffering, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	Even though storm warnings are received, the state does not have resources to evacuate people into shelters, he said, nor understand clearly how heavy rainfall will boost river levels.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are just not prepared to do that kind of work,” he told reporters.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are like sitting ducks.”
Cause_General	But rich countries, including the United States, also are seeing clearer climate impacts, and need to step up efforts to keep their people safe, Germanwatch said.
Distant_Evaluation	“Effective climate protection, as well as increasing resilience, is... in the self-interest of these countries,” Eckstein said.
Cause_General	The Germanwatch index highlighted other types of weather-related damage as well, from unusually heavy rainfall to landslides.
Distant_Historical	Sri Lanka, the second most-affected country in 2017, saw dramatic floods that year that killed 200 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless.
Distant_Evaluation	The U.N. climate negotiations should drum up more support for the poorest countries like Nepal, Vietnam, Sierra Leone and Madagascar to deal with rising losses linked to climate change, Germanwatch said.
Distant_Evaluation	All four of those countries figured in the index’s top 10 of nations most affected by weather disasters in 2017.
Distant_Evaluation	“They need predictable and reliable financial support for dealing with climate-induced loss and damage,” Eckstein said.
Cause_General	Five years ago, the U.N. climate talks set up a mechanism to better understand the damage that now will be unavoidable as a result of the 1 degree Celsius hike in global temperatures that has already occurred.
Cause_General	The mechanism also seeks to find ways to deal with the consequences as the world warms further.
Cause_General	But industrialized countries - which have historically emitted the most climate-changing emissions - have refused to pay compensation to those who are less to blame for global warming yet find themselves on the frontline of impacts.
Cause_General	Instead they are providing access to insurance.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At the Dec. 2-14 talks in Poland, arguments are expected over how progress on dealing with “loss and damage” should be assessed in 2023 when countries measure up their climate action against the goals of the Paris climate accord.
Main	HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has warned of floods and landslides triggered by heavy rains after tropical storm Son Tinh made landfall in northern coastal areas, although no casualties were reported on Thursday.
Distant_Historical	A long coastline makes Vietnam prone to destructive storms and flooding, with 389 people last year in natural disasters such as floods and landslides, the General Statistics Office said.
Cause_Specific	Son Tinh weakened to a tropical low pressure event by the time it reached Vietnam late on Wednesday, curbing fears of immediate and widespread damage, but raising concerns of flooding.
Main	“Heavy rain is forecast to continue in northern and central provinces, and threatens to cause flash floods and landslides in Hoa Binh, Son La, Lai Chau and Lang Son provinces,” the national weather forecaster said.
Cause_General	The Southeast Asian country had ordered vessels back to port and prepared evacuation plans ahead of the storm, which soaked parts of the Philippines on Tuesday.
Cause_General	Heavy rain of up to 350 mm (13.8 inches) flooded some coastal provinces, affecting nearly 64,000 hectares of rice and 3,200 hectares of cash crops on Thursday, the government’s disaster management agency said.
Cause_General	Floods limited road access to many parts of Nghe An province, 300 km (186 miles) south of Hanoi, state media said.
Cause_General	Last month heavy rains triggered flash floods and landslides that killed 24 people in the remote and mountainous northern provinces of Lai Chau and Ha Giang.
Cause_General	Nghi Son refinery, not far from Son Tinh’s path, was spared.
Distant_Evaluation	On Wednesday, a company safety official had said it had no plan to suspend operations.
Distant_Anecdotal	Paula King, a widow who lost everything when Hurricane Katrina hit her Mississippi town, awoke yesterday to the possibility of being evicted from the hotel room in Queens she has lived in since September.
Cause_Specific	Tens of thousands of evacuees across the country were moving out of their hotel rooms to comply with a deadline set by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is no longer paying their hotel bills.
Distant_Evaluation	Many were facing homelessness.
Main	Then, word came that the Radisson evacuees were getting a reprieve.
Main	As a throng of television crews gathered outside for a midday news conference, hotel officials announced that despite the end of federal compensation for evacuees affected by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the 17 families remaining at the Radisson could stay on indefinitely.
Main	The more than 100 evacuees in six other hotels across New York City will also be allowed to stay for now, advocates said.
Cause_General	It was the latest of several eviction scares for local evacuees in the past month.
Distant_Anecdotal	At the Radisson, Mrs. King, 59, sank into her bed, sighed in relief and called the close call another episode of a life lived in limbo.
Distant_Anecdotal	Mrs. King had fled Biloxi, Miss., as the hurricane headed for the city, leaving behind her new four-bedroom home.
Distant_Anecdotal	Since September, her address has been Room 612 of the Radisson Hotel J. F. K. in Jamaica.
Distant_Anecdotal	She lives out of suitcases and stores her food in cardboard boxes.
Distant_Anecdotal	''Now this is my bedroom, living room and dining room right here,'' she said, starting to cry.
Distant_Anecdotal	''My church is gone, my friends are gone, there's nothing there.
Distant_Anecdotal	Everything is gone, just devastated.
Distant_Anecdotal	You wonder where the people are.''
Cause_General	At the news conference, held on the first floor of the hotel, evacuees and their advocates criticized FEMA's decision to stop the hotel payments.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Charlie King, a lawyer and a Democratic candidate for New York State attorney general, said the evacuees in New York City would be protected by city and state housing laws and could not be thrown out without a formal eviction proceeding, which could take months.
Distant_Evaluation	Still, he said, given what many evacuees had already endured, ''it is just unbelievable that we are in this situation.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	City Councilman Charles Barron criticized a federal judge's rejection of a last-minute appeal to extend the FEMA deadline, and urged New York's Congressional leaders to fight the ruling.
Distant_Evaluation	Other speakers called FEMA's decision to end the subsidies another example of the bungling that has characterized the government's response to Katrina, one of the worst disasters in American history.
Distant_Evaluation	Brenda Stokely of the People's Hurricane Relief Fund called it ''the worst displacement of African-Americans and others since the Civil War.''
Cause_General	In a conference call with reporters yesterday, Libby Turner, FEMA's transitional housing director, defended the decision.
Distant_Evaluation	''We looked at the situation and this is what we decided as the best way to go,'' she said.
Cause_General	Ms. Turner said FEMA had spent $542 million on hotel accommodations for the hurricane evacuees.
Cause_General	About 88 percent of all evacuees staying in hotels and motels, or about 10,500 families, have moved into longer-term housing with rent-assistance checks from FEMA, she said.
Cause_General	Evacuees still living in hotels are eligible for assistance from state, city and charity organizations, she said.
Cause_General	Tony Pinto, the manager of the Radisson in Jamaica, said the hotel had been charging FEMA a $129 nightly rate.
Distant_Evaluation	''Were not throwing anybody out,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''We're just following the rules.''
Distant_Anecdotal	The Rev.
Distant_Anecdotal	Donald Hudson, a Queens pastor helping local evacuees, said that many of the hotel guests who had moved into rental apartments were getting rental assistance from FEMA.
Distant_Anecdotal	But, he added, others have had trouble getting leases because of problems with credit checks, unemployment and skeptical landlords.
Cause_General	Of the 373 families that came to New York City because of the hurricane, 245 have moved into apartments and other types of housing, said Angela Allen, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Homeless Services.
Main	(Reuters) - When Hurricane Michael barreled into the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday with 155-mph (249-kph) sustained winds, it defied forecasts made just two days beforehand, its wind speeds doubling since Monday and coming in just short of the highest category of intensity.
Error	Palm trees are seen during Hurricane Michael in Panama City Beach, Florida, U.S. October 10, 2018.
Error	REUTERS/Jonathan Bachman
Main	Michael was not the only tropical cyclone in recent years to undergo what scientists refer to as “rapid intensification,” defined as an acceleration of wind speeds of at least 35 mph (56 kph) in 24 hours or less.
Cause_Specific	The phenomenon has become more serious as sea waters have warmed with climate change.
Cause_Specific	“It is most likely that the very warm water in the Gulf ... is likely contributing to the intensity and the intensification that we have seen,” said Jim Kossin, an atmospheric scientist with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Cause_General	Rapid intensification is dangerous because it gives businesses, industry and people on the ground less time to take appropriate precautions ahead of hurricanes like Michael that hit shore with far more furious winds than originally expected.
Cause_Specific	Several factors can contribute, but warmer waters increase the potential for a storm becoming stronger, climate scientists have said.
Cause_Specific	Climate change means that warmer ocean temperatures are being seen more often, said Jennie Evans, a professor of Meteorology at Pennsylvania State University.
Cause_Specific	“Since we’ve got warm temperatures in the Gulf now, a hurricane has a much better chance to reach its maximum possible intensity, which appears to be what Michael is doing,” she said.
Cause_General	In some cases, high-altitude winds can put a cap on a storm’s ability to draw power from moist sea air.
Cause_General	But in Michael’s case, that brake was not in place.
Cause_General	Rapid intensification happens about 5 percent of the time and is difficult to predict.
Distant_Historical	Last year, in the Atlantic basin, forecasters correctly forecast six of 39 such instances, according to Michael Brennan, branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the U.S. National Hurricane Center.
Distant_Historical	The NHC said last year it failed to adequately predict the rapid intensification of Hurricane Matthew in 2016 to a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 kph).
Distant_Historical	Matthew was directly responsible for 585 deaths, including more than 500 people in Haiti, the NHC said.
Cause_General	While the science of tracking a storm relies heavily on data about conditions on its periphery, predicting intensity relies on measuring what is happening in the middle of it.
Cause_General	Typically, that means flying a hurricane hunter aircraft inside the storm, recording wind speeds from a weather buoy as a storm passes overhead or relying on satellites that may fly over once every other day.
Cause_General	Collecting consistent data through the storm is difficult and limits the ability to predict intensity, hurricane experts have said.
Cause_General	In recent storms that have intensified quickly, the phenomenon has been more exaggerated than in the past, according to a recent research paper co-authored by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory researcher Karthik Balaguru.
Cause_Specific	“At the end of the day, deep warm water, what we call ocean heat content, that’s really the fuel supply for these storms,” said J. Marshall Shepherd, director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia.

Error	Lebanese Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri speaks to the media in front of the Special Tribunal for Lebanon ahead of the closings arguments in the trial of Lebanon's Rafik al-Hariri alleged killers in the Hague, the Netherlands September 11, 2018.
Error	Bas Czerwinski/Pool via REUTERS
Cause_Specific	He spoke as prosecutors presented closing arguments in the case before a U.N.-backed tribunal against four suspects accused of carrying out the attack that killed Hariri and 21 others.
Distant_Evaluation	“We have always wanted justice and have not resorted to revenge,” Hariri, who attended the court session in The Hague, told journalists.
Distant_Evaluation	He added that dealing with the assassination of his father in court was difficult as a son but he had to put his feelings aside.
Distant_Evaluation	“There are things that hurt, but when in a position of responsibility, we have to look at the country’s interest.”
Cause_General	Four alleged members of Lebanon’s Iran-backed Hezbollah movement have been tried in absentia on charges of planning and executing the bombing in Beirut, which rocked the religiously divided country.
Distant_Evaluation	Wrapping up the prosecution case, Nigel Povoas said that Lebanon had been “plunged into darkness and horror” by the murder of Hariri.
Cause_General	GUILTY AS CHARGED
Distant_Evaluation	The prosecution presented a “mosaic of evidence...(that) leaves no reasonable doubt that all are guilty as charged,” Povoas said.
Cause_General	The trial lasted more than four years during which 307 witnesses were called.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The defendants, who remain at large, face a maximum sentence of life in prison.
Cause_General	In the absence of a smoking gun, prosecutors presented a complicated case based mostly on identifying five different, overlapping networks of disposable phones they said were used to carry out the bombing and attempt to manipulate media coverage afterwards by orchestrating a false claim of responsibility.
Cause_General	On Tuesday, prosecutors also focused on the links between the four accused, Salim Jamil Ayyash, Hassan Habib Merhi, Assad Hassan Sabra and Hussein Hassan Oneissi, to Shi’ite Muslim Hezbollah.
Distant_Evaluation	The four “shared a bond, in their common support for and links to Hezbollah”, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	Hezbollah denies any role in the killing of Hariri, a Sunni Muslim who had close ties with Iran’s regional adversary Saudi Arabia, and dismissed the tribunal as a tool of Israel and the United States.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The closing arguments will run until Sept. 21 with the defense expected to start on Friday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	No date has been set for a verdict but it is expected next year.

Main	“What he saw that night was a black boy with the audacity to ignore the police,” special prosecutor Joseph McMahon said during his opening statement of the officer, Jason Van Dyke.
Main	“Not a single shot was necessary.”
Cause_General	Van Dyke’s defense lawyer, Daniel Herbert, portrayed 17-year-old Laquan McDonald as a dangerous drug user who caused the officer to fear for his safety.
Distant_Evaluation	“McDonald was an out-of-control criminal running with a knife,” Herbert told jurors.
Distant_Evaluation	“What happened to Laquan McDonald is a tragedy.
Distant_Evaluation	It’s a tragedy, not a murder.”
Cause_General	The deaths of mostly unarmed black men at the hands of police officers across the United States in recent years have led to protests and sometimes violence in major U.S. cities.
Distant_Historical	The killings helped give rise to the Black Lives Matter movement and became an issue in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.
Cause_General	Eight witnesses for the prosecution, including a dispatcher, a Federal Bureau of Investigation forensic examiner and Chicago police officers took the stand on Monday.
Distant_Evaluation	Officer Joseph McElligott, who responded to the incident before the shooting, said McDonald swiped a knife at his squad car and kept walking, ignoring at least 30 orders to drop his weapon.
Distant_Evaluation	Asked by prosecutors why he did not shoot McDonald, McElligott, who had followed McDonald on foot with his gun drawn, said McDonald did not move directly toward him and he was trying to buy time for a Taser to arrive.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Prosecutors were expected to continue to call witnesses on Tuesday.
Cause_General	Prosecutors showed jurors a soundless dashboard camera video that showed Van Dyke gunning down McDonald as he appeared to move away from officers.
Distant_Historical	The video’s public release in 2015 spurred protests, fed a national debate over the use of excessive force by police against minorities and led to the ousting of local officials.
Distant_Historical	The video, released by the city more than a year after the shooting in response to a Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit, sparked days of protests in Chicago.
Distant_Historical	Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy, who has announced a mayoral run, was fired, and activists called for the resignation of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.
Cause_General	Emanuel said on Sept. 4 he would not seek a third term after facing widespread criticism over his handling of the city’s gun violence.
Cause_General	He did not specifically cite McDonald in his announcement.
Cause_General	A U.S. Department of Justice investigation that began after the video’s release found Chicago police routinely violated people’s civil rights, citing excessive force and racially discriminatory conduct.
Cause_General	Van Dyke, now 40, opted for a jury trial on Friday following the selection of a 12-person jury and five alternate jurors.
Cause_General	He was suspended without pay after he was first charged in 2015.
Cause_General	The 12-person jury includes one black person.
Distant_Evaluation	Van Dyke’s attorneys on Monday morning asked Cook County Judge Vincent Gaughan to dismiss the jurors, saying “the negative and inflammatory rhetoric” surrounding the case had made it impossible for them to be impartial, but the judge rejected that argument.
Cause_General	Gaughan also denied a defense motion to move the trial out of Chicago.
Cause_General	Van Dyke faces first-degree murder, aggravated battery and official misconduct charges.
Cause_General	He is the first Chicago police officer to face a murder charge for an on-duty incident in decades.
Distant_Historical	Three Chicago Police Department officers were indicted in June 2017 for conspiring to cover up McDonald’s shooting.
Cause_General	They have not yet been tried.
Main	(Reuters) - A Texas grand jury could potentially charge a Dallas police officer with murder in the shooting death of a neighbor whose apartment the officer said she mistook for her own, a prosecutor said on Monday, as the victim’s family demanded more answers.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, according to the Dallas Morning News, dozens of people marched through the city’s downtown on Monday evening, blocking traffic at times, to protest last Thursday’s fatal shooting of Botham Shem Jean, 26, an unarmed black man, by the white officer.
Cause_Specific	Amber Guyger, 30, a four-year veteran of the Dallas police force, was arrested on Sunday and charged with manslaughter, a lesser offense than murder for an unlawful killing that does not involve malice aforethought.
Distant_Evaluation	Police said Guyger has told investigators she mistook Jean’s residence for her own and shot him believing he was an intruder.
Cause_General	Questions have been raised over why there was a delay in charging Guyger and how she failed to know she was not in her own apartment.
Cause_General	An attorney for Guyger, who was released on $300,000 bond, could not be reached for comment.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	District Attorney Faith Johnson told reporters on Monday, “We plan to present a thorough case to the grand jury of Dallas County so that the right decision can be made in this case.”
Main	The grand jury may decide to uphold the manslaughter charge on which she was arrested, or it could consider charging Guyger with murder, Johnson said.
Cause_Specific	Guyger, who came home from her shift on Thursday in uniform, mistakenly went to Jean’s apartment one floor above her own and managed to enter because the door was slightly ajar, according to an arrest warrant affidavit posted online by local media.
Cause_Specific	Entering the darkened apartment, she noticed a figure whom she said she mistook for a burglar and fired twice, striking Jean once in the chest, the affidavit said.
Cause_General	Attorneys for Jean’s family challenged that account.

Main	CAIRO, June 28 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian police killed four terrorists of the so-called Hasm group in a shootout during a raid on their hiding place in Upper Egypt's province of Assiut, the Egyptian Interior Ministry said in a statement Thursday.
Cause_Specific	The police said the four were involved in a car bomb attack on March 24 in the northern province of Alexandria that killed two policemen and wounded at least four others.
Cause_General	A day after the blast, which failed to harm Alexandria security chief, the police announced killing six of Hasm group militants and said they were involved in the terror operation.
Cause_General	The security forces also arrested two Hasm members during relevant raids, according to Thursday's statement.
Cause_General	The police refers to Hasm group as the armed wing of the currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi.
Distant_Historical	Hasm appeared in late 2016 and claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks that killed policemen in the country.
Cause_General	Terror activities in Egypt have killed hundreds of policemen, soldiers and civilians since the military toppled Morsi in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his Brotherhood group.
Cause_General	The Sinai-based branch of the Islamic State (IS) regional terrorist group claimed responsibility for most of the terror operations in Egypt over the past few years.

Main	The government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi came under fierce attack on Monday after the Taliban said it had killed an Afghan hostage who was a colleague of the Italian journalist freed last month in a prisoner swap.
Cause_Specific	That journalist, Daniele Mastrogiacomo of La Repubblica, was freed on March 19 in exchange for five Taliban fighters released by the Afghan government.
Cause_Specific	Italy had lobbied Pakistan to make a deal.
Distant_Evaluation	At the time, the Italian government spokesman said, ''We think that the life of a person is very precious.''
Cause_Specific	But on Sunday, the Taliban said it killed Mr. Mastrogiacomo's translator, Ajmal Naqshbandi, after failing to arrange another prisoner swap.
Cause_Specific	Taliban fighters had already killed the men's driver.
Distant_Evaluation	The swap that led to Mr. Mastrogiacomo's release was roundly condemned by the United States, Britain and other allies, which argued that deals with terrorists only make civilians more vulnerable.
Main	On Monday, there were fresh complaints in Italy by opposition parties and by a charity group that claimed that the government had paid millions of dollars to free an earlier hostage in Afghanistan.
Cause_General	That group, Emergency, acted as a mediator in the case of Mr. Mastrogiacomo.
Cause_Specific	Gino Strada, the leader of the group, said Monday that Mr. Prodi's government paid $2 million in ransom that freed Gabriele Torsello, a journalist kidnapped in October.
Distant_Evaluation	In a statement, Mr. Prodi's office did not deny the payment but said it was applying the same practices established under the previous government of Silvio Berlusconi.
Distant_Evaluation	''The negotiations for the freeing of hostages have been conducted in a correct way and in tight collaboration with the Afghan government,'' read a statement from Mr. Prodi's office.
Distant_Evaluation	''Our priority has always been one: saving human lives.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Prodi condemned the execution of Mr. Naqshbandi and accused the opposition party of using his death for political gain.
Cause_General	Mr. Strada of Emergency urged the government to assist Rahamtullah Hanafi, who works for the group and is being detained by the Kabul government on suspicion of playing a part in Mr. Mastrogiacomo's kidnapping.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Strada said that Mr. Hanafi was innocent and that he had delivered $2 million to the Taliban to free Mr. Torsello.
Cause_General	On Monday evening, Mr. Prodi told reporters that he had contacted Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, to request the release of Mr. Hanafi but that the decision was up to the Kabul government.
Distant_Evaluation	Opposition party members criticized the Prodi government.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Sandro Bondi of the center-right Forza Italia party said he would seek a full a parliamentary inquiry and called on Mr. Prodi to resign.
Distant_Evaluation	A right-wing senator, Roberto Calderoli, accused the government of discriminating between Italian and Afghan hostages and called for Mr. Prodi's impeachment.
Distant_Evaluation	''The government negotiated in a discriminatory fashion, rushing to save what they saw as the A-league hostage and leaving the other, second-class captives to their tragic destiny,'' he told reporters.

Main	LOS ANGELES, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- A man living in Los Angeles was sentenced to 221 years to life in state prison for trying to kill six Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies and wounding two of them, authority said Thursday.
Cause_Specific	According to a statement issued by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, 42-year-old Juan Manuel Martinez was found guilty of six counts of attempted murder, five counts of assault on a peace officer with a semiautomatic firearm and one count each of false imprisonment of a hostage, dissuading a witness by threat of force and possession of a firearm by a felon.
Cause_General	At Thursday's sentencing, a Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge ordered Martinez to spend 221 years to life behind bars, the statement said.
Distant_Historical	The incident that Martinez involved occurred on June 23 last year, when he shot and wounded a motorcycle deputy who pulled him over during a DUI checkpoint and wounded another deputy as he fled.
Cause_Specific	Martinez opened fire on other deputies before hiding in a converted garage for nearly eight hours.
Cause_General	This shooting incident forced a SWAT team at bay for nearly eight hours before he was arrested.
Distant_Historical	Four years ago this week, as American troops made their first, triumphant entrance into Baghdad, joyous Iraqis pulled down a giant statue of Saddam Hussein.
Distant_Evaluation	It was powerful symbolism -- a murderous dictator toppled, Baghdadis taking to the streets without fear, American soldiers hailed as liberators.
Cause_General	After four years of occupation, untold numbers killed by death squads and suicide bombers, and searing experiences like Abu Ghraib, few Iraqis still look on American soldiers as liberators.
Cause_General	Instead, thousands marked this week's anniversary by burning American flags and marching through the streets of Najaf chanting, ''Death to America.''
Cause_General	Once again, tens of thousands of American troops are pouring into Baghdad.
Main	Yesterday the Pentagon announced that battle-weary Army units in Iraq would have to stay on for an additional three months past their scheduled return dates.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Bush is desperately gambling that by stretching the Army to the absolute limits of its deployable strength, he may be able to impose some relative calm in the capital.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And he seems to imagine that should that gamble succeed, the Shiite-dominated government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki will, without any serious pressure from Washington, take the steps toward sharing political power and economic resources it has tenaciously resisted since the day it took office a year ago.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Unless Mr. Maliki takes those steps -- eliminating militia and death squad members from the Iraqi Army and police, fairly sharing oil revenues, and rolling back laws that deny political and economic opportunities to the Sunni middle class -- no lasting security gains are possible.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	More Iraqi and American lives will be sacrificed.
Distant_Evaluation	Even among Shiites, who suffered so much at the hands of Saddam Hussein and who are the supposed beneficiaries of Mr. Maliki's shortsighted policies, there is a deep disillusionment and anger.
Distant_Evaluation	This week, a Washington Post reporter interviewed Khadim al-Jubouri, who four years ago swung his sledgehammer to help knock down the dictator's statue.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Jubouri said that ever since he watched that statue being built he had nourished a dream of bringing it down and ushering in much better times.
Distant_Evaluation	Now, with friends and relatives killed, kidnapped or driven from their homes, the prices of basic necessities soaring and electricity rationed to four hours a day, Mr. Jubouri says the change of regimes ''achieved nothing'' and he has come to hate the American military presence he once welcomed.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Maliki's supporters can be even more frightening to listen to.
Cause_General	This week's demonstration in Najaf was organized by the fiercely anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, whose political party and militia helped put Mr. Maliki in power and are still among his most important allies.
Distant_Evaluation	Two months into the Baghdad security drive, the gains Mr. Bush is banking on have not materialized.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	More American soldiers continue to arrive, and their commanders are talking about extending the troop buildup through the fall or into early next year.
Distant_Evaluation	After four years, the political trend is even more discouraging.
Distant_Evaluation	There is no possible triumph in Iraq and very little hope left.

Cause_General	Since March 30, the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have been going through popular protests against Israel.
Cause_General	Demonstrators protest close to the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip, which has been ruled by Hamas movement since 2007.
Cause_General	On Monday night, two Palestinian young men were killed and another was injured after a missile fired by an Israeli drone directly hit them when they approached the fence of the border.
Cause_General	Al-Qedra said that since March 30, around 180 Palestinians were killed and over 19,000 injured, more than half of whom were shot by Israeli soldiers' gunfire, including women, children, paramedics and journalists.
Cause_General	Israel accused Islamic Hamas movement of standing behind organizing the protests and rallies to pressure Israel to end around 12 years of a tight blockade imposed on Gaza.
Cause_General	Efforts exerted by Egypt and the United Nations Special envoy Nickolay Mladenov had so far failed to broker a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hamas-led groups in the Gaza Strip.

Main	MAPUTO, Jan. 15 (Xinhua) -- Terrorists who attacked the Mocimboa da Praia district in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado have extended their reach of mob activities to the district of Palma, killing seven people and burning houses.
Main	In an interview with Xinhua, Angelina Tayobo of the Environmental Association of Cabo Delgado (AMA), a local non-governmental organization based in that province, said the attack began from Saturday night to Sunday dawn.
Main	"""They attacked a community from the administrative post of Ulumbe, Palma district and killed seven people and burned down houses,"" she said."
Cause_General	Angelina Tayobo said since last October her organization has been moving from one community to another due to the attacks which first had happened in Mocimboa da Praia and now were extending.
Cause_General	"""At the moment we were working in Lalane, Palma district."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"But now we have to leave again,"" she said."
Distant_Evaluation	According to her, AMA was not the only organization that has been affected by the terrorist attacks.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The recent attack was in an area that is likely to compromise some organizations, because it is an area where Anadarko, an American petroleum company has built resettlement houses due to the field of oil exploration they are working on,"" said Tayobo."
Cause_General	She added that at first the mob only killed police officers, but now they attack civilians and rape women or kidnap them, and posted movement flags in communities where they attacked.
Distant_Evaluation	"""They use various weapons, sticks, machetes and guns, and they do horrible things, they are violent, we cannot hide it or get around of this,"" she said."
Cause_General	The source also revealed that in the same violent incursion on Saturday night, the terrorists entered the house of the head of the post office, but luckily no one was at home.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It seems they have a tendency to move out from the areas where the police took control, so the attacks are now unpredictable, it can happen at any place,"" said the same source."
Distant_Historical	On October 5 in 2017, a group of about 30 armed fundamentalists launched simultaneous attacks against three police stations in Mocimboa da Praia, which later was classified by the police as terrorism.
Cause_General	The Police of the Republic of Mozambique has not yet announced on what happened in the Saturday attack, but information indicates that they have been looking into the situation.
Main	A former assistant superintendent and a former principal at a Texas state school for juvenile offenders were arrested Tuesday on charges of deviate sexual intercourse and other sexual contact with six boys ages 16 to 19.
Distant_Historical	The two, Ray E. Brookins, 42, and John P. Hernandez, 41, administrators serving the Texas Youth Commission, were named two years ago in a Texas Rangers investigation into accusations of sexual abuse at the West Texas State School in Pyote.
Cause_Specific	But the findings, cited in internal reports, came to light only with news accounts in February, setting off a statewide outcry, legislative inquiries and a revamping of the Youth Commission.
Cause_Specific	More than 2,100 complaints of mistreatment have been received on a hot line and families have filed civil lawsuits.
Distant_Evaluation	''With today's indictments, the victims of sexual abuse at West Texas State School are a step closer to the justice they deserve,'' said the Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott, who took over the prosecution after complaints that the local district attorney had let the case languish.
Main	Mr. Brookins, who had been acting superintendent in charge of the West Texas State School, was arrested at his Austin home and ordered held on $100,000 bond at the Travis County jail, the attorney general's office said.
Main	The office said Mr. Hernandez was arrested at his parents' home in Fort Stockton and ordered held on $600,000 bond at the Pecos County jail there.
Cause_General	Neither man has appeared in court to offer a plea, a spokesman for Mr. Abbott said late Tuesday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Hernandez, in a phone conversation weeks ago, said he would plead not guilty if indicted.
Distant_Evaluation	His lawyer, Albert Valadez, said Tuesday that Mr. Hernandez ''maintains his innocence.''
Cause_General	Neither Mr. Brookins nor a lawyer could be reached for comment.
Cause_General	The indictments were brought by a Ward County grand jury after the part-time district attorney, Randall W. Reynolds, ceded jurisdiction April 4 to Mr. Abbott and three other prosecutors from his office.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Brookins and Mr. Hernandez were charged with 13 instances of using their mouths and hands on the genitals of youths detained at the school in 2004 and 2005.
Cause_General	The youths' names were withheld.
Distant_Evaluation	The indictments were called ''excellent'' by Jay Kimbrough, a former deputy state attorney general and the special conservator named by Gov.
Distant_Evaluation	Rick Perry and legislative leaders to change the Youth Commission.
Distant_Historical	According to documents that have emerged in recent weeks, the Youth Commission knew as early as February 2005 that a Texas Ranger had visited the school to investigate a math tutor's report that students had complained of being sexually abused by Mr. Brookins.
Cause_General	The Ranger, Brian Burzynski, corroborated the accusations, along with similar complaints against Mr. Hernandez.
Cause_General	Both administrators resigned without criminal charges, and state investigators are examining why commission records remained secret and whether they might have been altered to hide evidence of the accusations.
Distant_Historical	Before transferring to West Texas, Mr. Brookins had been disciplined at another Texas youth facility for having pornography on his computer.
Distant_Historical	Both men were reported to superiors for taking boys from the dorms at night for trysts behind closed doors, official reports later documented.
Distant_Historical	After resigning from the state school, Mr. Hernandez was hired at a charter school in Midland.
Main	(Reuters) - A retired police officer, who investigators believe is the “Golden State Killer,” was charged on Thursday with four more counts of murder in Santa Barbara, California.
Cause_Specific	Joseph DeAngelo, 72, who was once a police officer in the California towns of Exeter and Auburn, was charged last month in Sacramento with eight murders during a crime spree in the 1970s and ‘80s.
Cause_General	Over the past 16 days since the Sacramento charges were filed, the Santa Barbara county district attorney’s office has been working with the county sheriff’s office, gathering evidence and conducting interviews, said Santa Barbara County District Attorney Joyce Dudley.
Main	“As a result of this process, I have decided to file four counts of first degree murder with special circumstances against Joseph James DeAngelo,” she told a news conference.
Cause_General	Diane Howard, from the Sacramento County Public Defender’s Office and who is DeAngelo’s attorney on the Sacramento charges, was not immediately available for comment.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Each of the four counts carries multiple allegations and each count carries the potential for a sentence of life without possibility of parole or the death sentence, she said.
Cause_General	DeAngelo, who has two adult children, was arrested on April 24 at his home in a Sacramento suburb.
Cause_Specific	He is suspected in a dozen killings as well as 45 rapes and more than 120 burglaries in 10 California counties in a decade-long crime spree considered one of the worst in the state’s history.
Cause_General	He is scheduled to appear in court in Sacramento on Monday.
Cause_General	He has not yet entered a plea to any of the charges against him.

Cause_Specific	Investigators finally cracked the Sacramento case, which has long haunted victims’ families and law enforcement, by comparing crime scene DNA to genetic information on commercial genealogy websites that consumers use to explore their ancestry.
Cause_General	Detectives followed the family trees of close matches, seeking people who might be the killer.
Cause_Specific	The process produced a promising lead a week ago, when the DNA of a relative pointed to DeAngelo based on his age and the fact that he lived near where the attacks occurred.
Distant_Historical	DeAngelo was identified as a suspect about two months after the case gained renewed attention in the book, “I’ll Be Gone in the Dark,” by journalist Michelle McNamara, who died in 2016 and was married to the actor Patton Oswalt.
Main	MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Gunmen with rifles and pistols killed three people on Friday and injured at least seven in a tourist plaza in downtown Mexico City, police said, adding that they were chasing three men dressed as mariachi musicians who fled on motorbikes.
Cause_General	After years of keeping a lid on the worst violent crime that has plagued Mexico, its capital has seen homicides surge since 2014 to record levels, presenting a major challenge to an incoming city government that has vowed a clean-up.
Cause_General	In a statement, police said the three victims were killed at an intersection on the edge of Plaza Garibaldi, a major tourist destination packed with mariachi bars, just as the capital was kicking off independence day weekend celebrations.
Cause_General	The victims had been at a restaurant when the shooting started around 10 p.m., media said, adding that forensic officials had counted more than 60 bullet cases at the scene.
Distant_Anecdotal	“People were screaming and running,” said a disabled woman who sells cigarettes in Garibaldi, shortly after having heard what she thought were fireworks.
Distant_Anecdotal	She declined to be identified.
Distant_Evaluation	The identity of the three dead was not immediately clear, but the Milenio newspaper said they were men.
Distant_Evaluation	Another newspaper said two of the injured were women.
Cause_General	Four of the injured were hurt as the gunmen fled, Mexico City police chief Raymundo Collins told reporters.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Nothing like this has ever happened before,” said Samuel, a man who added that he had worked for thirty years around the square in one of the world’s biggest, most populous cities, but declined to give his last name.
Main_Consequence	Videos on social media and television showed a heavy police presence, with the attack site cordoned off and yellow markers where the bullet casings fell, but dozens of people continued to drink and listen to live music nearby.
Distant_Evaluation	Police blame much of the capital’s crime on retail drug dealing and protection rackets run by violent gangs, though the government says at least one of these has links to a major national trafficking group, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.
Cause_General	Plaza Garibaldi borders one of Mexico City’s most notorious neighborhoods, Tepito, home to La Union gang police say is behind a spurt in drug-dealing and protection rackets.

Cause_General	In August, police arrested the presumed leader of the gang, Roberto Moyado Esparza “El Betito”.
Cause_General	Since then, the Tepito neighborhood has suffered a wave of violence, including several killings.

Main	ATHENS, Sept. 18 (Xinhua) -- Anti-fascist groups organized a series of events in Athens and other cities of Greece on Tuesday, five years after the killing of 34-year-old musician Pavlos Fyssas by a far-right party supporter.
Distant_Historical	On Sept. 18, 2013, Fyssas, a rapper with an anti-fascist action, was stabbed to death in Piraeus port suburb of Keratsini by George Roupakias, a member of the neo-fascist Golden Dawn (Chryssi Avghi) party.
Main	Leading the march on Tuesday was the banner of Fyssas' family including Fyssas' mother Magda Fyssa.
Distant_Evaluation	"""You see on their faces that there is no trace of remorse."
Distant_Evaluation	"That is what makes you mad,"" she told local Real FM radio station, referring to her son's murderer and ultra-rightists."
Main	The march started from the site where the killing took place outside a cafeteria and continued to Golden Dawn's offices, at the center of Piraeus.
Cause_General	Police forces had been deployed in the area, fearing clashes between leftists and members of far-right groups.
Cause_General	Minor scuffles occurred with hooded protesters pelting rocks at anti-riot policemen who responded by using tear gas, Greek national news agency AMNA reported.
Distant_Historical	Fyssas' death was the first politically-motivated crime committed by a Golden Dawn supporter since the party's entrance in parliament for first time in 2012, amid voters' anger and disappointment at the harsh austerity introduced to deal with the financial crisis.
Distant_Historical	His murder sparked a judicial investigation that culminated in a criminal trial against the party and dozens of its members, which started in April 2015.
Cause_General	Since then a series of delays has stalled the procedure, while Golden Dawn has entered the parliament again in the 2015 general elections and today holds 15 seats in the 300-member strong assembly.
Distant_Evaluation	"""September 18th is a day of suffering for every democrat, a black page in the modern history of our country."

Main	VANCOUVER, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- Police announced charges here Monday against a refugee from Syria for the murder of a 13-year-old girl more than a year after her body was found in a local park.
Main	The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP)'s Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) announced first degree murder charges against 28-year-old Ibrahim Ali, a Syrian refugee who arrived in Canada 17 months ago.
Distant_Historical	Marrisa Shen, the child of Chinese immigrants to Canada, was found murdered on July 18 in Burnaby's Central Park not far from her home.
Distant_Historical	Police deemed her death a random act of violence and launched what they called their largest investigation in 15 years.
Cause_General	Police said new evidence in recent days identified Burnaby resident Ali as the lone, prime suspect.
Main	They arrested him without incident on Friday, Sept. 7, in Burnaby, a metropolitan center that neighbors the City of Vancouver.
Cause_General	IHIT said Ali was not known to police until this investigation.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This investigation called upon a great deal of resources and long hours for everyone involved,"" said Superintendent Donna Richardson, Officer-in-Charge of IHIT in a news release."
Distant_Evaluation	"""The successful outcome in this investigation was a result of the diligence, unwavering commitment and relentless pursuit of justice from all of our investigators,"" she said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""The incident had a profound impact on the community,"" said Chief Superintendent Deanne Burleigh, Officer-in-Charge of Burnaby RMCP."
Distant_Evaluation	"""I hope that this arrest helps Marrisa's family and the community in their healing process,"" she said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""I want to thank IHIT, our own members from Burnaby RCMP and all of our other policing partners who worked diligently to ensure that the suspect was brought to justice in this challenging investigation."""
Cause_General	Police said the massive investigation involved canvassing more than 1,300 residents in the area around Central Park, the location at which Shen's body was found just hours after she was reported missing.
Cause_General	They conducted more than 600 interviews, reviewed more than 1,000 hours of video footage from 60 locations in the area and eliminated more than 2,000 persons of interest.
Distant_Historical	IHIT told reporters on Monday that Ali arrived in Canada 17 months ago as a refugee.
Distant_Evaluation	They said the murder still appears to be a random act of violence, meaning Shen did not know her alleged attacker.
Cause_General	Ali is now in custody and will make his next appearance in court on Sept. 14.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We would like to take this opportunity to thank the public for all of their ongoing support and concern for us in this past year,"" the Shen family said through the police."
Distant_Evaluation	"""We are aware that so many people reached out to the police to provide information and we were so grateful for that."""
Distant_Evaluation	They also thanked the media and the police for their work on the case.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We hope that justice will now be served and that Marrisa can finally be at peace in heaven,"" the statement said."
Main	LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Former rap mogul Marion “Suge” Knight was sentenced in a Los Angeles courtroom on Thursday to 28 years in prison for manslaughter in the death of a man he ran over with his pickup truck outside a hamburger stand in 2015.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The sentence appeared to forestall any chance of a future recording business comeback for Knight, 53, known as much for repeated run-ins with the law as for his career as a hip-hop executive promoting the likes of Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Tupac Shakur during the 1990s.
Cause_Specific	The co-founder of the influential label Death Row Records pleaded no contest on Sept. 20 to one count of voluntary manslaughter for the hit-and-run killing of 55-year-old Terry Carter.
Cause_Specific	He admitted then to using a “deadly and dangerous weapon” on Jan. 29, 2015, when he ran down two men with his pickup truck in an altercation outside Tam’s Burgers that spilled over from a quarrel on the nearby set of a TV commercial for the film “Straight Outta Compton.”
Cause_Specific	Carter later died of his injuries.
Cause_Specific	The second man, Cle “Bone” Sloan, was left with a badly mangled left foot and head injuries.
Cause_Specific	Knight, who was out on bail in a robbery case at the time, fled the scene but was later arrested.
Distant_Evaluation	Knight had previously contended that he accidentally struck the two men with his vehicle while trying to flee what he thought was an ambush attempt.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Had Knight been convicted of murder and attempted murder as originally charged, he faced a life sentence with no eligibility for parole for 25 years.
Cause_General	As part of his agreement with prosecutors to plead no contest - the legal equivalent of guilty - to the lesser offence of manslaughter, all other charges in the case were dropped.
Cause_General	Two separate criminal cases in which he was charged with robbery and making criminal threats were also dismissed.
Cause_General	Judge Ronald Coen said Knight had earned the equivalent of 4.2 years credit for time served in pretrial detention.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He also is eligible to shave another 15 percent, or 4.2 years, off his term for good behaviour while in prison, meaning he could end up serving nearly 20 years before release.
Cause_General	Seated beside his lawyer and wearing an orange jail uniform and horned-rimmed glasses, the burly, bald ex-college football player showed no visible emotion as sentence was pronounced.
Cause_General	He did not address the court.
Distant_Historical	Knight previously served more than half of a nine-year term for violating the probation he received in 1995 for an assault on two aspiring rappers at a Hollywood recording studio.
Error	Slideshow (4 Images)
Distant_Historical	The probation violation stemmed from a scuffle involving Knight at a Las Vegas hotel in September 1996, hours before Shakur was shot to death while riding in a car with Knight on the Las Vegas Strip.
Distant_Historical	Knight was slightly wounded in the attack.
Distant_Historical	Knight was later named by police as a suspect in the shooting death of rival rap artist Christopher Wallace, known as Notorious B.I.G., but was never charged.
Distant_Historical	Both rap murders remain unsolved.
Distant_Historical	In 2002, the year after his release from prison, a federal racketeering probe of Knight and his record label was closed with the company pleading guilty to misdemeanour tax charges.
Distant_Historical	The onetime college football star and “gangsta” rap pioneer eventually lost control of his label in bankruptcy proceedings.
Main	KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia will reopen an investigation into the murder of a Mongolian model in 2006, media reported on Thursday quoting the country’s police chief, in a case that could spell more trouble for former premier Najib Razak.
Distant_Historical	Two former police officers, who were serving as members of Najib’s personal security detail at the time of the murder, were sentenced to death for the crime.
Cause_General	Najib, who was defeated in an election last month after nearly a decade in power, has denied knowing the woman, but the question of who ordered the killing has never been answered.
Cause_General	“I can confirm we are reopening investigations,” Inspector-General of Police Tan Sri Mohamad Fuzi Harun said, adding that a new police report submitted by the model’s father on Wednesday was one reason for the fresh probe into the murder case.
Distant_Historical	Altantuya Shaariibuu, 28, was killed and blown up with military grade explosives in a forest near Kuala Lumpur.
Cause_General	Her father Setev Shaariibuu on Wednesday met with Malaysia’s new attorney-general Tommy Thomas and Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who defeated the scandal-tainted Najib in a stunning election upset last month.
Distant_Evaluation	Civil society groups have alleged Altantuya’s murder was linked to her role as an interpreter for Abdul Razak Baginda, a former associate of Najib, in Malaysia’s purchase of two Scorpene-class submarines from French shipbuilding giant DCNS in 2002.
Distant_Historical	Abdul Razak, who said he had had an affair with Altantuya, was charged with abetment in her murder.
Distant_Historical	He was acquitted in 2008.
Distant_Historical	One of the officers found guilty of her murder, Sirul Azhar Uma, fled to Australia shortly before his sentence was handed down.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Sirul said last month he would cooperate with any new investigation into the murder if he was given a full pardon.
Distant_Evaluation	Malaysia is considering revoking his death sentence to facilitate his extradition.
Distant_Evaluation	Asked for comment on the new developments on Thursday, a spokesman for Australia’s Attorney-General said it does not comment on extradition requests.
Distant_Evaluation	Asked about the Altantuya case in an interview with Reuters this week, Najib said: “I’m on record to have sworn in a mosque in the name of Allah that I had nothing to do with the case.
Distant_Evaluation	“I still maintain that I only knew she died 4-5 days after the death...that was the first time I heard about her.
Distant_Evaluation	There is no evidence to show I ever knew her.”
Cause_General	Mahathir is seeking to lay multiple charges against Najib for his alleged role in looting billions from state-run fund 1MDB and blames him for widespread corruption in the previous government.
Cause_General	Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing.
Distant_Evaluation	President Felipe Calderón ran last summer on a promise to create jobs, but in his first five weeks as chief executive he has made it clear his first priority is to turn his government into the scourge of organized crime.
Main	The president has sent thousands of federal police and troops into the drug-plagued states of Michoacán and Baja California to break up criminal organizations and stop the brutal violence they perpetuate.
Main_Consequence	The federal forces have burned marijuana crops, arrested suspected drug gang members and disarmed local police forces the authorities say are crippled by corruption.
Distant_Evaluation	''We will continue with the operations that let us re-establish the minimum conditions of security in some parts of the republic, so that little by little we can take back our streets, our parks, our schools,'' Mr. Calderón said in a New Year's message to the nation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But some opposition politicians and experts on the drug trade wonder if the federal interventions are not more flash than substance, and question if they will have a lasting impact on the drug trade and police corruption, whose roots run deep.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Calderón's predecessor, Vicente Fox, created an elite force to combat narcotics dealers and arrested dozens of drug cartel leaders during his six-year term.
Distant_Historical	Rather than stanch the violence, however, the arrests led to a brutal war between the remaining traffickers for the smuggling routes and territory.
Cause_General	In the southwestern state of Michoacán, where more than 500 people were killed last year, the violence has persisted despite the president's decision to send in more than 7,000 officers and soldiers last month.
Cause_General	Drug dealers killed about 21 people during the last three weeks of December, according to local news reports.
Cause_General	This week, a mass grave was found with seven bodies bearing signs of gangland executions, and a 12-year-old boy was executed in what appeared to be a drug dispute.
Cause_General	Still, Mr. Calderón made a rare appearance dressed in military fatigues on Wednesday to congratulate troops in Michoacán and to tout their successes.
Main_Consequence	Four top members of the Valencia drug gang were arrested and hundreds of acres of marijuana were burned, the authorities said.
Cause_General	In Tijuana on Tuesday, Mr. Calderón ordered 2,600 soldiers and 110 federal police officers to begin an operation aimed at ending the grip of mobsters on the local police department, slowing the flow of drugs and ending kidnappings and killings related to the trade.
Main_Consequence	The officers began patrolling the streets with caravans of pickups filled with heavily armed officers in black combat outfits.
Main_Consequence	The army set up roadblocks, while navy boats prowled the coast and helicopters buzzed overhead.
Main_Consequence	Soldiers in camouflage uniforms pulled over cars at random and searched them.
Main_Consequence	Federal and state police manned checkpoints in the town.
Main_Consequence	The federal government also stripped all 2,320 city police officers of their weapons on Wednesday night.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The move prompted fears that anarchy would break out in the city streets, where drunken brawls, car thefts, muggings and drug-induced mayhem are a daily fact of life.
Distant_Evaluation	The city secretary of public security, Luis Javier Algorri, said Friday morning there were too few federal officers to keep order, much less ferret out drug gangs at the same time.
Distant_Evaluation	''We think they don't have the experience to deal with these sorts of problems,'' Mr. Algorri said.
Distant_Evaluation	''And without firearms this kind of work will be hard to carry out.''
Distant_Evaluation	The decision to disarm the local police reflects the belief among federal officials that many local officers are on the payroll of drug cartels as assassins, enforcers and, in some cases, kidnappers.
Distant_Evaluation	Federal prosecutors say the lack of help from the local police in border towns, either because they are corrupt or afraid, makes it nearly impossible to dismantle drug cartels.
Distant_Evaluation	The mayor of Tijuana, Jorge Hank Rhon, said he welcomed the intervention.
Distant_Evaluation	He did not dispute that a significant number of police officers were corrupt, saying their salaries are so low that drug lords can easily bribe them.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's not the police,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's some policemen.''
Distant_Evaluation	Many residents said they were tired of finding victims of mob executions in the streets in the mornings, as well as the wave of kidnappings that has rocked this border town over the last 12 months.
Distant_Historical	Last year there were more than 300 killings in the city, most of them linked to drug gangs, including 25 police officers, authorities said.
Distant_Evaluation	In interviews, most residents said they welcomed the crackdown, even as some expressed skepticism the caravan-style patrols and roadblocks would do much to hurt drug traffickers.
Distant_Anecdotal	David López, a 28-year-old importer, watched Wednesday night as about 25 federal policemen in full combat uniforms and carrying machine guns pulled over an expensive pickup truck outside a downtown nightclub.
Distant_Anecdotal	It seemed to him a showy waste to use a small army of officers to make a traffic stop.
Distant_Evaluation	Tijuana has always been a major corridor for drug smugglers because it is one of the busiest border crossings in the country.
Cause_General	Since the 1990s, the infamous Arellano Félix family has controlled the traffic of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and synthetic drugs, but in recent years the organization has been weakened significantly, law enforcement authorities say.
Distant_Evaluation	Federal police commanders acknowledged their job would be difficult in a city of 1.5 million where most of them do not even know the street names, much less the workings of the criminal underworld.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Still, several expressed confidence they would prevail.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's a big city and there are a lot of people here who are crooked,'' said Inspector Alejandro Zapata.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''But this is not going to end until we put a end to the Arellano Félix organization.''
Main	BEIJING (Reuters) - A former mining magnate with suspected ties to the family of China’s retired security tsar Zhou Yongkang was sentenced to death on Friday on charges of leading a gang on a crime spree spanning two decades.
Error	Liu Han, former chairman of Hanlong Mining, smokes a cigarette during a conference in Mianyang, Sichuan province, in this file photo taken March 21, 2008.REUTERS/Stringer/Files
Cause_General	The sentencing of Liu Han, handed down by a court in the central province of Hubei, was the culmination of one of the highest-profile cases against a private businessman since President Xi Jinping took office last year and began a campaign against pervasive graft.
Cause_General	Liu’s younger brother Liu Yong, also known as Liu Wei, was also sentenced to death.
Distant_Evaluation	Microblog statements from state media outlets China Central Television and the Xinhua news agency said the brothers, along with their 36-member “mafia-style” gang, committed intentional homicide.
Cause_General	Xi’s crackdown has zeroed in on Sichuan province, where Liu’s company - privately held Hanlong Mining - is based.
Distant_Evaluation	Sichuan was a power base for Zhou, the retired chief of China’s vast domestic security apparatus, who stands at the centre of the biggest corruption scandal in more than six decades, sources have told Reuters.
Distant_Historical	Sources have told Reuters that Liu was once a business associate of Zhou Bin, Zhou Yongkang’s eldest son.
Distant_Evaluation	State media have not explicitly linked Liu’s case to Zhou Yongkang, but have said Liu’s rise coincided with Zhou’s time as Sichuan’s Communist Party boss.
Cause_General	Liu’s lawyer could not be immediately reached for comment.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Willy Lam, a scholar of Chinese history and politics at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said there would be extra attention paid to the case because of Liu’s links to the Zhou family.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I think what’s happening is that Xi Jinping and (Party anti-corruption tsar) Wang Qishan want to establish a harsh precedent because this is one of the biggest corruption cases since Xi took over,” Lam said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“They want to set a precedent to make people afraid, in a sense, to have a deterrence impact on corrupt officials.”
Distant_Historical	Prosecutors in Hubei said Liu Han and his younger brother formed the gang in 1993.
Distant_Historical	It “carried out a vast number of criminal activities”, including the murders of nine people, they said.
Cause_General	Other members of the gang received sentences ranging from 11 years in prison to death, Xinhua said.
Cause_Specific	State media reported that Liu, who was arrested last year, faced charges ranging from murder to gun-running and extortion for crimes carried out in Sichuan.
Distant_Evaluation	He denied leading a gang, and media reports said he denied killing anyone or holding or trading guns illegally.
Distant_Historical	Hanlong had attempted to take over Australia’s Sundance Resources Ltd, an exporter of iron ore focused on West Africa.
Distant_Historical	The deal was scrapped a year ago after Hanlong missed funding deadlines.
Distant_Historical	Liu founded Hanlong Group, a conglomerate with interests in sectors from solar energy to real estate and infrastructure, in 1997.

Main	Mourners and masked militants wearing masks and holding guns carried the bodies of the seven militants from the hospital in the city of Khan Younis in southern Gaza Strip and went to their homes for a goodbye look.
Cause_General	The bodies of the militants belong to six members of al-Qassam Brigades, Hamas armed wing and one member of Salahidin Brigades, the armed wing of the pro-Hamas Popular Resistance Committees.
Main	The mourners and the militants carried the bodies of the seven militants wrapped with green Hamas flags and took them from their homes and went to the mosque for the last prayers before taking them to the graveyard for burial.
Cause_Specific	The seven militants were killed on Sunday night in an exchange of fire with a special Israeli army force that entered into an area east of the southern Gaza Strip city of Khan Younis.
Cause_Specific	According to Israeli army and Hamas armed wing, the soldiers of the special were in a civilian car that drove three kilometers into an area that is under Hamas militants' control.
Cause_Specific	Hamas armed wing said in a leaflet that the aim of the Israeli special military operation into the area of Abbassan, east of Khan Younis, was to kidnap a senior Hamas Military Commander called Noor Baraka.

Main	GAZA, Nov. 11 (Xinhua) -- At least six Islamic Hamas militants were killed on Sunday night in Israeli airstrikes on southeastern Gaza Strip, east of the city of Khan Younis, medical sources said.
Main	Ashraf al-Qedra, spokesman of the health ministry in Gaza told reporters that seven other Palestinians were injured in the intensive Israeli airstrikes.
Main_Consequence	In response, Gaza militant groups fired barrages of rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel, according to Israeli media and local Gaza media reports.

Cause_General	"""After the special force was detected, our troops chased the force and dealt with it."""
Main	The group said the war planes then intervened and began to strike on the area to cover the withdrawal of the special force from the place.
Cause_General	Nur Barakeh, 37 years old, is the commander of Hamas military wing al-Qassam Brigades in the eastern area of Khan Younis.
Distant_Evaluation	Israel accused him of being responsible for digging tunnels, firing rockets into Israel, shooting at Israeli soldiers by snipers and carrying out attempts to kidnap Israeli soldiers.
Cause_General	It is the first military escalation between Hamas and the Israeli army in the Gaza Strip since an Egyptian-brokered understanding for calm in the Gaza Strip was reached between the two sides last month.
Cause_General	Eyad al-Bozzom, spokesman of the interior ministry in Gaza, confirmed that a security event happened east of the southern Gaza Strip town of Khan Younis.

Main	A third youth has been arrested in connection with a series of vicious crimes in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park in Queens that left one man dead and another in a coma, the police said yesterday.
Main	The suspect, Herman Gonzalez, 19, of Van Cleef Street, just west of the park, was arrested Friday and charged with two counts of second-degree robbery, the police said.
Distant_Evaluation	It was not immediately clear what role Mr. Gonzalez might have played in the crimes that the police say linked him to the two other suspects, Belter Yovanni Gubara Rivera and Marcos Polanco, both 17.
Cause_Specific	But a law enforcement official said that on Nov. 20, he attacked a 20-year-old man delivering food on a bicycle.
Cause_Specific	The man was punched and kicked, and the robber stole $200 and his cellphone, the official said, adding that Mr. Gonzalez had confessed.
Cause_General	The police said Mr. Rivera and Mr. Polanco both confessed to attacking and robbing several people in the park between Nov. 22 and Dec. 25.

Distant_Historical	A court in the Congolese capital Brazzaville sentenced each of the soldiers in April for the killings of 11 civilians committed in 2014 while the soldiers were serving in an African Union peacekeeping mission in Central African Republic.
Cause_General	HRW said it secured a copy of the written judgment only last month.
Main	The three men are now free, having already served most of their sentences, HRW said in a statement.
Distant_Historical	Although the court found the soldiers guilty of war crimes which can carry the death penalty under Congolese law, its judgment cited unspecified extenuating circumstances.
Distant_Evaluation	“The authorities in the Republic of Congo missed an opportunity to provide justice for the murders of civilians and to show that no peacekeeper is above the law,” said Lewis Mudge, a senior researcher at HRW.
Distant_Evaluation	“Giving the soldiers who committed murder little more than a slap on the wrist sent a damaging message to other peacekeepers that they risk little if they commit such crimes.”
Cause_General	Congo’s government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Distant_Evaluation	The government of President Denis Sassou Nguesso, one of Africa’s most secretive with a history of repression at home, has previously rejected claims that it has ignored allegations of human rights abuses against its soldiers.
Distant_Evaluation	Failure to hold peacekeepers accountable for crimes committed on foreign soil is a recurring complaint of rights activists.
Distant_Evaluation	The responsibility to prosecute falls on troop-contributing countries who are often unwilling or unable to press charges against their troops.
Distant_Historical	According to HRW, the Congolese peacekeepers killed an unarmed boy and arrested at least 12 other civilians in the Central African town of Boali in March 2014 after a peacekeeper was killed in a firefight with a local militia leader.
Distant_Historical	The bodies of the 12 people were found nearby in a mass grave in February 2016.
Distant_Historical	The remains of a 7-month-old baby who was also killed were never found, HRW said.
Distant_Historical	The Congolese court judgment referred only to 11 of the victims.
Distant_Historical	Congo Republic’s hundreds of peacekeepers in Central African Republic later became part of a U.N. mission.

Main	(Reuters) - The man suspected of murdering a prominent Houston doctor, who once treated former U.S. President George H.W.
Main	Bush, fatally shot himself in the head after being confronted by two police officers, authorities said on Friday.
Cause_Specific	Police were searching for Joseph Pappas, who they say shot and killed cardiologist Mark Hausknecht on July 20 as the doctor rode his bicycle to work in Houston’s sprawling Medical Center complex.
Cause_Specific	The gunman, who was also on a bicycle, fled the scene.
Cause_Specific	Authorities received a tip on Friday morning from a member of the public who spotted Pappas near a Jewish Community Center in the city.
Cause_General	When an officer approached Pappas, he saw the suspect was wearing a bulletproof vest, police chief, Art Acevedo, said at a news briefing.
Main	A backup police officer arrived, Acevedo said, at which point Pappas shot himself in the head.
Distant_Evaluation	Houston police have said Pappas had held a two-decade grudge against Hausknecht after his mother died during a surgery performed by the doctor.
Distant_Evaluation	“I’m thankful we’re going to end this week with a great sense of relief in the city of Houston and the Texas Medical Center,” Acevedo said.
Distant_Evaluation	Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said in a statement that Pappas’s death closed a chapter in a horrific tragedy.
Distant_Evaluation	“And once again it involved heroic acts by frontline officers of the Houston Police Department, which has my gratitude for how it has handled this case and so many others,” Turner said, also thanking the public for its help.
Main	(Reuters) - A divided Connecticut Supreme Court on Friday threw out the 2002 murder conviction of Michael Skakel, a member of the Kennedy family, and ordered a new trial.
Error	FILE PHOTO: Michael Skakel reacts to being granted bail during his hearing at Stamford Superior Court, in Stamford, Connecticut November 21, 2013.

Main	The 4-3 decision upheld a lower court judge’s 2013 ruling that Skakel’s lawyer did not provide an adequate defense, necessitating a new trial on charges that he killed his neighbor Martha Moxley at her Greenwich home in 1975.
Cause_Specific	Justice Richard Palmer, writing for the majority, said the trial lawyer had failed to present the jury with testimony from a witness who could have provided an alibi for Skakel.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Palmer said the prosecutors’ case was “far from strong,” and the outcome might have been different with the alibi testimony.
Distant_Evaluation	“This has been a long road for Michael, and we are grateful to the court for its ruling today,” said Hubert Santos, Skakel’s lawyer in the appeal.
Distant_Historical	Skakel, a cousin of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and nephew of Ethel Kennedy, the widow of U.S.
Distant_Historical	Senator Robert F. Kennedy, was sentenced to 20 years in prison before he was freed on bail when state Superior Court Judge Thomas Bishop ruled that his attorney had failed to provide an effective trial defense.
Distant_Historical	In 2016, the Connecticut Supreme Court rejected Bishop’s conclusion and reinstated Skakel’s conviction, prompting Santos to ask the court to reconsider its decision.
Cause_Specific	Since the 2016 ruling, one justice in the majority retired and was replaced by another justice, who voted in favor of ordering a new trial, thus flipping the court’s decision.
Distant_Evaluation	In a dissenting opinion, Justice Carmen Espinosa said Skakel’s decision to file a motion for reconsideration after a justice’s retirement amounted to “judge shopping.”
Distant_Evaluation	A spokesman for the Connecticut chief state’s attorney’s office, which argued against Skakel’s appeal in court, said the office was reviewing the decision.
Cause_General	The case drew enormous media attention, both because of the connection to the Kennedys and because the murder took place in Greenwich, one of New York City’s toniest suburbs.
Distant_Historical	Moxley was found bludgeoned to death with a golf club, later traced to a set owned by Skakel’s mother, when she and Skakel were both 15 years old.
Cause_General	The case was unsolved for more than 20 years.
Distant_Historical	In 1998, former Los Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman, known for his role in the O.J.
Distant_Historical	Simpson murder case, wrote a book implicating Skakel.
Distant_Historical	A grand jury was convened that year, and Skakel was charged in 2000.

Distant_Historical	Prosecutors say Beate Zschaepe was part of the National Socialist Underground (NSU), whose members killed eight Turks, a Greek and a German policewoman over seven years from 2000.
Cause_General	Judges will give a verdict on July 11, the court said on Tuesday, ending a trial that has taken more than five years to complete.
Distant_Evaluation	“I am a compassionate person and was able to see and feel the distress and despair of the families,” Zschaepe, 43, said in her closing statement at the regional court in Munich.
Distant_Evaluation	“I apologize for the suffering I have caused,” she added.
Cause_General	This was only the second time that Zschaepe has spoken in court after more than 400 days of trial hearings.
Distant_Evaluation	She said she had lacked the physical and mental strength to testify and feared her words would be misinterpreted or twisted.
Cause_General	Zschaepe has denied taking part in the murders with two men, Uwe Boehnhardt and Uwe Mundlos.
Distant_Historical	They killed themselves in 2011 when police discovered the gang by chance.
Distant_Evaluation	But she has, through her lawyer, said she felt morally guilty for not stopping them.
Distant_Historical	In her previous testimony in 2015, she denied being a member of the NSU and described feeling horrified and bewildered when Boehnhardt and Mundlos told her about some of the murders.
Distant_Historical	She considered informing the police at one point, she said at the time, but the men threatened to commit suicide and she was financially dependent on them.
Distant_Evaluation	On Tuesday she said that she did not know how the victims were chosen and that she had denied reality to some extent for a long time.
Distant_Evaluation	Only once she had turned herself in did she realize the full extent of the crimes, she said.
Distant_Evaluation	She said she no longer followed right-wing ideology, saying of her neo-Nazi beliefs that “this chapter is closed”.
Distant_Evaluation	Addressing the judges, she said: “Please do not judge me for something that I neither wanted nor committed.”
Cause_General	The prosecution has demanded a sentence of life in prison.
Cause_General	Zschaepe’s lawyers have urged the court to convict her of the lesser charges of arson and robbery.
Distant_Evaluation	“I only want one thing now, to find closure so that I can eventually lead a life free of fear,” Zschaepe told the court.
Distant_Historical	The NSU attacks were the most violent by a guerrilla group in Germany since the end of the far-left Red Army Faction’s two-decade spree in 1991, in which 34 people are estimated to have been killed.
Distant_Historical	For years after the 1993 robbery and killing of seven people at a fast-food restaurant about 30 miles northwest of here, thousands of leads failed to bring investigators the break needed to solve one of the most gruesome crimes in Illinois history.
Distant_Historical	It was not until 2002 that the authorities announced they had arrested two men in the infamous Brown's Chicken Massacre, so called because the victims were shot or stabbed and left inside two walk-in refrigerators at Brown's Chicken and Pasta restaurant in the quiet, middle-class village of Palatine.
Main	On Friday, more than 14 years after the killings, opening statements are expected at the trial of one of the accused, Juan A. Luna Jr., in Cook County Criminal Court here.
Distant_Evaluation	Those 14 years have tested the patience of the victims' families, of investigators and of Palatine's residents.
Distant_Evaluation	''Everybody feels like they want it to be over,'' said Mayor Rita Mullins, who was finishing her first term when the slayings occurred.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''They probably will never find the answer to 'why' -- why did this happen, why did it happen in Palatine -- but the answer will be as to 'who.'''
Distant_Evaluation	During all the years the case was unsolved, Ms. Mullins said, ''people did look from side to side, wondering who could have done this.
Distant_Evaluation	It was the fear of the unknown.''
Distant_Historical	Mr. Luna was 18 on Jan. 8, 1993, when, prosecutors say, he and 20-year-old James Degorski walked into Brown's around 9 p.m., intending to rob it after it closed.
Distant_Historical	The two shared a chicken dinner, then slipped on latex gloves and herded the couple who owned Brown's and five employees to the rear of the restaurant, then into the two refrigeration units, the authorities say.
Distant_Historical	Less than $2,000 was taken, they say.
Distant_Historical	Relatives notified the police when employees failed to arrive home on time.
Distant_Historical	Five victims were found in one walk-in cooler at the restaurant; two were in another.
Distant_Historical	Some had been shot several times; the throat of one was slit.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Luna, who had worked at the restaurant until a few months before the slayings, was one of 300 current and former employees interviewed and cleared not long after the killings.
Distant_Historical	But in 2002, a former girlfriend of Mr. Degorski came forward with details of the crime that investigators have said only someone linked directly to it could have known.
Distant_Historical	The woman told investigators she waited nine years because Mr. Degorski had threatened to kill her if she revealed what he told her about that night.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Degorski and Mr. Luna were arrested in May 2002.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Both pleaded not guilty; if convicted, however, they could face the death penalty.
Cause_General	Both have been held without bail in Cook County Jail.
Cause_General	Mr. Degorski will be tried after Mr. Luna.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Among the evidence prosecutors are expected to present at Mr. Luna's trial is a videotaped confession he gave shortly after his arrest, a confession that he has since claimed was coerced.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They are also likely to present DNA tests that they say link the remains of the suspects' partly eaten chicken dinner, retrieved from a trash can, to saliva samples gotten from the men a few weeks before their arrests.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Defense lawyers have indicated they may try to discredit the DNA analysis by arguing that the test results were not conclusive and that the chicken dinner was mishandled.
Cause_General	Judge Vincent M. Gaughan has barred lawyers from speaking to the news media outside the courtroom.
Cause_General	Neither Mr. Luna's lead lawyer, Clarence L. Burch, nor the Cook County state's attorney, Richard A. Devine, who is prosecuting the case himself, would grant an interview for this article.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A confession and forensic evidence often help prosecutors in cases in which the crime occurred many years earlier, said Leonard L. Cavise, a professor of criminal law at DePaul University College of Law, so Mr. Luna's statement and the DNA test results could present major hurdles for his legal team.
Distant_Historical	The Brown's Chicken franchise never reopened, and the building was torn down in 2001.
Cause_General	There was talk for a time of erecting a memorial to the victims, but the idea faded, and now the corner is a parking lot for a Eurofresh Market.
Distant_Evaluation	Some victims' families have said they are grateful that the case is nearing completion, however painful it is to recall the details after so many years.
Cause_General	Many have requested privacy as the trial begins, declining to speak to reporters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Jennifer Shilling, a daughter of the restaurant's owners, Richard and Lynn Ehlenfeldt, said she and her two sisters planned to attend the trial.
Distant_Evaluation	''My sisters and I, as well as the families of our mother and father, have patiently waited for this trial and justice for more than 14 years,'' Ms. Shilling, a Wisconsin state representative from La Crosse, said in a statement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''All of us expect that it will be an emotional and painful experience as we again relive the grief and anguish all of us have experienced.''

Main	BERLIN (Reuters) - An Iraqi man suspected of the rape and killing of a 14-year-old German girl is also under investigation for raping an 11-year-old German girl in a refugee shelter in the town of Wiesbaden, prosecutors said on Tuesday.
Main	The 20-year-old identified as Ali Bashar is suspected of raping the girl in March and sexually assaulting her again in May with a 14-year-old Afghan, the public prosecutor’s office in Wiesbaden said.
Cause_General	Police arrested the Afghan suspect who originally was known to German authorities as a witness in the murder case of the 14-year-old, Susanna Feldman, the office said.
Cause_General	An outcry over the rape and murder case led Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives to call for stricter immigration rules and faster deportation of failed asylum seekers.
Cause_Specific	Iraqi authorities extradited Bashar to Germany on June 9 after Kurdish security forces took him into custody.
Cause_General	He had left Germany with relatives early last month.The Iraqi suspect, who arrived in Germany at the height of Europe’s migrant crisis in 2015, was known to police because he had become violent with officials over his asylum status.
Cause_General	Bashar had previously been suspected in the rape of the 11-year-old girl at the refugee center, although an initial investigation was inconclusive.
Distant_Historical	His asylum request was rejected in December 2016.
Distant_Historical	Merkel’s decision to welcome more than 1 million refugees in 2015 boosted support for the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party.
Cause_General	The government has put aside more than 20 billion euros ($23.5 billion) to integrate asylum seekers and tackle the root causes of migration.
Cause_General	Merkel last month coolly rebuffed U.S. President Donald Trump’s assertion made in a tweet that migrants were behind a surge in crime in Germany, pointing to statistics that showed crime was down.
Main	(Reuters) - A Florida grand jury formally indicted Nikolas Cruz on Wednesday on 17 counts of premeditated murder in the first degree and 17 counts of attempted murder in the first degree for last month’s shooting spree at a high school in Parkland, prosecutors said.
Cause_General	No date was set for an arraignment, at which Cruz will be allowed to enter a plea, said Constance Simmons, a spokeswoman for the Broward County state attorney’s office.
Cause_Specific	The 19-year-old former student is accused of using a semiautomatic assault rifle to kill 17 students and faculty members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland on Feb. 14.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He faces a maximum sentence of either execution or life in prison without parole if convicted.
Distant_Evaluation	The public defender’s office in Broward County has said Cruz was willing to plead guilty if county prosecutors choose not to pursue the death penalty.
Cause_General	The prosecutors’ office has said a decision on this has not yet been made, according to Simmons.
Cause_General	The attack, one of the deadliest at a school in a country where school shootings happen multiple times a year, has reignited a national debate about overhauling gun laws in Florida and beyond.

Error	(Xinhua/He Xianfeng)
Main	CHICAGO, Oct. 5 (Xinhua) -- Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder in fatally shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald four years ago.
Cause_General	Jurors reached the verdict on Friday afternoon for the high-profile trail as Chicago police enhanced their presence in the city, bracing for possible protests and even violence in case of a not guilty outcome.
Distant_Evaluation	"Learning the verdict, demonstrators erupted in cheers outside the courthouse, chanting, ""Justice for Laquan."
Distant_Evaluation	"Justice for Laquan."""
Distant_Historical	White police officer Jason Van Dyke shot 17-year-old McDonald 16 times in 2014, which triggered racial tension for years in Chicago, the third largest city in the United States.
Distant_Historical	McDonald reportedly broke into a truck on the night of Oct. 20, 2014 and Jason Van Dyke was one of police officers dispatched to the scene.
Distant_Historical	McDonald carried a knife but walked from police when Van Dyke fired 16 shots into the teenager, the police car's dashcam video showed.
Cause_General	The jury reached the second-degree murder verdict instead of first-degree, which means they found the officer believed his life was in danger at that time but the belief was unreasonable and his reaction was unjustified.
Distant_Evaluation	Jurors told media later that the officer's claim of self-defense did not match video footage and they could not buy it.
Distant_Evaluation	"Second-degree murder carries a sentence of 4 to 20 years, said special prosecutor Joseph McMahon, who called the verdict ""gratifying"" and justice for Laquan McDonald and his family."
Cause_General	Van Dyke was also found guilty of 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The end of this trial offers an opportunity for this city to come together,"" McMahon added."
Distant_Evaluation	However, Van Dyke's lead attorney, Daniel Herbert, said he wasn't surprised by the verdict and vowed an appeal on the judge's refusal to move the trial outside Cook County because of the extensive pretrial publicity.
Distant_Evaluation	"He argued that it was ""a sad day for law enforcement."""
Cause_General	Hundreds of people marched along a main avenue in downtown Chicago after the verdict, interrupting traffic.
Cause_General	But the demonstration remained peaceful so far.
Main	KAMPALA, June 14 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan military has arrested the country's former police chief and four senior officers over alleged murder of a police spokesperson last year, local media reported Thursday.
Main	Kale Kayihura, former Inspector General of Police (IGP), and close associates were arrested for alleged involvement in the assassination of former Assistant Inspector General of Police, Andrew Felix Kaweesi, who doubled as director of human resource development and police spokesperson in March 2017, according to the state-owned daily New Vision.
Main	Kayihura's arrested associates include Jonathan Baroza, his former personal assistant; Herbert Muhangi, the former commander of police flying squad; Ndahura Amooti, former head of crime intelligence and Richard Ndabwoine, former cyber intelligence chief.
Cause_Specific	"""Security sources revealed that the arrest of Kayihura and his colleagues is in connection with the assassination of former police spokesperson."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"All the suspects are expected to be charged before the military court martial,"" said the paper."
Distant_Historical	Kaweesi was shot dead by unknown gunmen, together with his bodyguard and driver in Kulambiro, a suburb of the capital Kampala, while heading to work on March 17, 2017.
Cause_General	Kayihura who is still a serving army officer of the Uganda People's Defense Forces has been staying at his Kashagama farm after handing over IGP office to his former deputy on March 15.
Distant_Historical	Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni sacked Kayihura and Henry Tumukunde as police chief and security minister respectively in a surprise reshuffle in March.
Distant_Historical	The sacking came after media reports of poor working relationship over a power struggle that led to an increase in murders and insecurity in the East African country.
Cause_General	Since his dismissal, some of Kayihura's close aides have been arrested over allegations of collusion to kidnap the former bodyguard of Rwanda's President Paul Kagame in Kampala and forceful deportation of refugees.

Distant_Evaluation	"QENA, Egypt, July 28 (Xinhua) -- ""Vendetta is better than shame"" is a common saying in Upper Egypt, the tribal southern part of the country, which indicates how Upper Egyptian families think of the chronic tradition of blood feuds as ""an honor."""
Cause_General	The phenomenon has been prevailing in the tribal side of southern Egypt for decades or even generations, where family revenge killing equals honor, dignity and manhood, although most of the causes that triggered the enmity are often trivial, such as a quarrel about fighting kids, or a dispute over a phone recharge card.
Cause_General	The norm in Upper Egypt is that when a family member is killed, the family buries the body but never holds a funeral until they kill the murderer or one of his dearest family members in revenge, and the blood feuds go on.
Cause_General	"In Upper Egypt's Qena province, Nag Ma'alla of Hugairat village is referred to as ""the village of widows"" for there is almost no home without a widow who has lost her husband in a blood feud or without bullet holes or traces in the walls."
Cause_General	Most of the village men involved in blood feuds live in the nearby mountains to escape either murder or arrest.
Distant_Anecdotal	"Widows usually dress only in black for long years as a sign of mourning and they breastfeed their babies the desire for blood revenge, said Fathiya al-Essaily, a 70-year-old woman from ""the village of widows,"" who lost both her husband and elder son in vendetta feuds."
Distant_Anecdotal	"""A widow here would push her son for killing in revenge regardless of the consequences and the possible murder or escape of her son, because only then she would be no longer living in shame,"" the old lady told Xinhua at her one-storey home in Nag Ma'alla of Hugairat village in Qena."
Distant_Anecdotal	"62-year-old Mohamed Owais, also from Nag Ma'alla, lost both his brother and his 15-year-old nephew in a similar feud that represented ""the most difficult moments"" in his life."
Distant_Anecdotal	"""When my brother saw his boy smeared with blood and breathing his last, he lost consciousness and died and we buried them both together,"" Owais said while sitting outside his two-floor raw-brick house."
Distant_Anecdotal	The blood feud, Owais continued, went on for several years until the Owais family accepted a reconciliation brokered by security authorities and popular reconciliation committees one and a half years ago.
Cause_General	The tradition of reconciliation in a blood feud is a kind of ceremony watched by all villagers, where the one whose turn is to be killed walks to the family whose turn is to take revenge carrying his death shroud, a white garment, in his arms.
Cause_General	He submissively and apologetically lies down in front of the man who is supposed to kill him as a sign of seeking forgiveness.
Cause_General	His apology is always accepted because it is considered in Upper Egypt as shame for him and honor for the other family.
Cause_General	Lawmaker Hamza Abu Sehli from Qena, who lost his elder son in a blood feud with a big family, said that the recently reached reconciliation put an end to a wave of bloodshed between the two families and restored his inner peace.
Distant_Evaluation	"""I convinced my family to accept the reconciliation urged by official and popular efforts to stop the killing circle between the two families, and my reconciliatory attitude was respected by everyone,"" the parliamentarian told Xinhua in the Upper Egyptian province."
Distant_Anecdotal	Mahmoud Abdel-Mo'ez, a 65-year-old retired employee at the Ministry of Education, recalled the tragedy of losing his son during his wedding ceremony due to a vendetta feud and losing his wife who died out of grief over her son's death a few months later.
Distant_Anecdotal	An elementary school student in Hugairat village, whose parents conditioned not to mention his name, lamented that most teachers are reluctant to show up at school due to the many surrounding feuds, noting that most students drop education at some stage.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""A lot of boys here learn how to carry guns since childhood,"" the boy continued with a sad tone."
Distant_Anecdotal	"""I hope that we all carry pens rather than guns for the best interest of our village and nation."""
Cause_General	Despite the cancerous tradition, the authorities, in cooperation with wise people through special committees, managed to achieve dozens of reconciliations and end bloodshed between big families over the past few years.
Cause_General	"""The security department in Qena, in cooperation with the governorate and the reconciliation committees, managed to achieve 100 reconciliations between feuding families in the past four years,"" said Qena's Deputy Security Chief Alaa al-Ayyat."
Cause_General	"In the last two years, the police also seized more than 3,000 unlicensed guns with over 20,000 bullets in Qena province, which is known as ""the capital of Upper Egypt's tribes."""
Main	For his part, Governor of Qena Abdel-Hamid al-Haggan said that the political leadership puts the elimination of blood feuds as one of its priorities in Upper Egypt, particularly in Qena.
Cause_General	He stressed that such disputes negatively affect the nation's struggle for progress and development.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The good traits and values of Upper Egyptians, including forgiveness, contributed to the rising number of reconciliations that reflects a positive change in Upper Egyptian cultures and thoughts,"" the governor told Xinhua."
Main	(Reuters) - Los Angeles police named a 28-year-old man on Sunday as the suspect who took hostages and barricaded himself for three hours inside a Trader Joe’s grocery store in which he fatally shot a woman.
Main	Gene Atkins is being held on a $2-million bail on suspicion of murder for Saturday’s attacks, said Los Angeles Police Department spokesman Drake Madison.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Atkins is likely to appear in court to be formally charged early this coming week, Madison added.
Cause_General	Atkins is suspected of repeatedly having shot his grandmother and another woman in a separate part of the city before being chased by police and crashing his car outside the Trader Joe’s, according to the police account.
Cause_Specific	He exchanged gunfire with police and entered the crowded store, police said.
Cause_General	Some people managed to escape the store by climbing through a window down a rope ladder, according to video footage.
Cause_Specific	The stand-off came to an end after the gunman, who at one point was shot in the arm, talked with police over the phone to negotiate a surrender before emerging.
Cause_General	The woman killed at the store was identified as Melyda Corado by relatives, who said she worked there as a manager.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Trader Joe’s called the attack the “saddest day in Trader Joe’s history” in a statement on its website, saying the store would remain closed indefinitely.
Distant_Evaluation	“Our thoughts are with her family, and our Crew Members and customers who experienced this terrifying and unimaginable ordeal,” the statement said.
Cause_General	Atkin’s grandmother was left in critical condition in the earlier attack on Saturday, police said.
Cause_General	There was no update on her condition on Sunday, they said.
Main	AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas executed an inmate on Wednesday dubbed the “Lovers’ Lane” killer who was convicted of a 2003 ambush in which he tried to rob a man in a parked car on a remote road in San Antonio and then fatally shot him.

Error	Texas Department of Criminal Justice/Handout via REUTERS/File Photo
Main	Juan Castillo, 37, was put to death by lethal injection at the state’s death chamber in Huntsville, a prisons official said.
Cause_General	It was the 11th execution this year in the United States and the sixth in Texas, which has executed more inmates than any other state since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.
Distant_Evaluation	“To everyone that has been there for me you know who you are, love y’all.
Distant_Evaluation	See y’all on the other side.
Distant_Evaluation	That’s it,” he was quoted as saying in his final statement by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
Distant_Historical	Castillo had maintained his innocence, saying he was not at the scene.
Distant_Historical	He was convicted of killing aspiring rapper Tommy Garcia, then 19.
Distant_Historical	Prosecutors said Garcia was set up by his then girlfriend, who lured him to the remote spot with the promise of sex and drugs but plotted to have him robbed by Castillo and two others.
Distant_Historical	After Garcia parked, Castillo, brandishing a pistol, smashed a car window, opened a door and demanded Garcia give him his money and jewelry.
Distant_Historical	When Garcia refused and tried to run away, Castillo shot him seven times, prosecutors said.
Distant_Historical	Of the four people in the plot, only Castillo was sentenced to death and his lawyers have said there was no physical evidence that linked him to the crime.
Distant_Evaluation	They also said he was convicted because of tainted testimony that included a jailhouse informant who told a Texas court Castillo confessed to him that he was the triggerman.
Distant_Historical	The informant later recanted and said he lied to help himself, court documents showed.
Distant_Evaluation	Prosecutors said sources pointed law enforcement to the suspects and that Castillo’s co-defendants told authorities he was the person who shot Garcia.
Main	Two bombings in Algeria, one aimed at the main government building in the country's capital, killed at least 23 people on Wednesday in a sharp escalation of the violence linked to Al Qaeda that has spread across North Africa.
Cause_Specific	Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, North Africa's most active terrorist group, claimed responsibility for the attacks.
Cause_General	It was the deadliest attack in the capital in more than a decade, and followed warnings by officials in Europe and the United States that Algeria was becoming a center for terrorism that could threaten Europe and North America.
Distant_Evaluation	''This is a crime, a cowardly act,'' said Prime Minister Abdelaziz Belkhadem, speaking on national radio shortly after the explosion tore open the front of the building housing his office.
Distant_Evaluation	''It can only be described as cowardice and betrayal at a time when the Algerian people are asking for national reconciliation.''
Main_Consequence	The bombing of the government building killed at least 12 people and wounded 118, according to APS, the country's official new agency.
Main	The agency reported that 11 others were killed and 44 wounded in a second attack, at a police station on the road to the country's international airport, east of the capital, Algiers.
Distant_Historical	The terrorist group, originally called the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, was formed in 1998 as an offshoot of an Islamist group that had been fighting the government in a decade-long civil war.
Cause_General	Its numbers had been badly eroded in recent years by two government offers of amnesty and a subsequent manhunt by the Algerian security forces.
Distant_Historical	But the core of the group, hundreds strong, has steadfastly rejected reconciliation and last year aligned itself with Al Qaeda.
Cause_General	Its aim is to overthrow the government and install an Islamic theocracy there and throughout North Africa.
Distant_Historical	Al Qaeda' s second in command, Ayman al-Zawahri, publicly anointed the group as Al Qaeda's representative in North Africa on the fifth anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, and in January the group changed its name to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, a region that includes Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco.
Distant_Evaluation	The group has apparently undergone a revival since then, drawing new members from across North Africa, terrorism experts in Europe and North Africa say.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Governments on both sides of the Mediterranean fear that the group is coalescing into a regional terror movement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''The concern is that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb want their reach to be larger than it is now,'' said Rear Adm. William H. McRaven, commander of Special Operations Command Europe, speaking last month at his headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany.
Distant_Evaluation	''They are already somewhat regional and growing.''
Cause_General	United States Special Operations forces are helping train troops in North Africa to combat the threat.
Distant_Historical	In December and January, Tunisian security forces killed 12 Islamic extremists and captured 15 after uncovering a cell whose leaders had come from Algeria.
Cause_General	The Moroccan authorities are hunting as many as 10 would-be suicide bombers after three men blew themselves up on Tuesday.
Cause_General	A fourth man wearing explosives was killed before he could detonate them.
Cause_General	One policeman was killed in the blasts.
Cause_General	The men were being sought in connection with an explosion on March 11 in an Internet cafe in Casablanca in which another Islamic extremist blew himself up.
Distant_Evaluation	Many terrorism experts say they suspect that those men are also linked to the Algerian group.
Distant_Historical	Attacks in Algeria have steadily increased since December, when a convoy of foreign construction workers was bombed outside the capital.
Cause_General	In February, the group claimed responsibility for detonating seven powerful car bombs outside police stations in six towns east of Algiers, killing six people.
Distant_Evaluation	Those coordinated attacks alarmed officials because they involved more sophisticated remote detonation devices.
Cause_General	Last month, a convoy of oil workers was attacked in Ain Defla Province, west of Algiers, killing one Russian and three Ukrainians.
Cause_General	Subsequent clashes with the Algerian Army killed nine soldiers and four fighters from Al Qaeda, Algerian officials said.
Distant_Evaluation	The bombings on Wednesday confirmed fears that the violence would again enter the capital, which became a battleground during the horrific civil war that began in 1992 after the Algerian military canceled elections because an Islamist party was poised to win.
Distant_Evaluation	''Although we know there are still terrorists outside of Algiers, we didn't believe they were capable of making this kind of attack so near the government headquarters,'' said Mahmoud Belhimeur, a senior editor of El Khabar, Algeria's largest-circulation Arabic newspaper.
Cause_Specific	The attacks began at around 10:45 a.m., when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-packed vehicle through the gate at the building housing the prime minister's office.
Main_Consequence	The bomb tore apart the front of the six-story building, shattered windows in nearby ministries and set several cars in the vicinity on fire.
Cause_General	Witnesses reported seeing rescue teams remove at least seven badly burned bodies from the rubble.
Distant_Anecdotal	''It was shocking, incredible,'' said Leila Benhamoud, who was at the scene shortly after the blasts.
Distant_Anecdotal	''Even in the park nearby, they found a burned body in the grass.''
Main_Consequence	A second blast destroyed a police station in Bab Ezzouar, an eastern suburb.
Cause_Specific	Al Jazeera's bureau in Rabat, Morocco, reported that it had received a telephone call from a spokesman for Al Qaeda claiming responsibility for both attacks.
Cause_Specific	The caller said that the blasts were carried out by three Qaeda members driving trucks filled with explosives, and that the bombers had focused on three sites, including the government headquarters, in Algiers, the Interpol office in Algiers and a building housing the special police forces in Bab Ezzouar, Al Jazeera said.
Cause_General	However, there was no report of an attack at Interpol's Algiers offices.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''We won't rest until every inch of Islamic land is liberated from foreign forces,'' the caller said in a recording of the phone call broadcast on Al Jazeera and carried on its Web site.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He also called for the release of ''oppressed prisoners in Algeria, Morocco, Mauritania and elsewhere.''
Cause_General	Pictures of the three men said to have carried out Wednesday's attacks were posted on an Islamist Web site, according to the SITE Institute, a United States group that monitors militants' messages.
Cause_General	In the photos, each man was shown wearing a green turban with automatic rifles propped on the wall on each side of him.
Cause_General	The men were identified as Muadh bin Jabal, Al Zubair Abu Sajda and Abu Dajjana.
Cause_General	Mr. Sajda and Mr. bin Jabal were wearing suicide vests.
Cause_General	Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is divided into nine commands, each in charge of a geographic zone.
Cause_General	Attacks in Zone II, which covers Algiers, are believed to be carried out under the command of Sadouai Abdelhamid, known as Yahia Abu el- Haithem, who was sentenced in absentia last month to 20 years in jail.
Cause_General	The attacks follow a period of intensifying military action against the group in which one of its top leaders, Soheib Abu Abdul Rahman, was recently reported to have been killed.
Distant_Evaluation	That the bombing occurred on the 11th of the month brings to mind the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States and the March 11, 2004, bombings in Madrid, and some terrorism experts suggested that the attacks added to the accumulating symbolism of that day of the month.
Distant_Evaluation	''I would say that numerology plays a large part,'' said Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism expert at the Swedish National Defense College in Stockholm.
Distant_Evaluation	''But the bigger issue is that you have May elections in both Algeria and Paris.''
Cause_General	French counterterrorism officials are particularly worried about Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb because of the difficulty in monitoring traffic between Algeria, a former colony, and France.
Distant_Historical	Last year, the group singled out France as a target.
Distant_Evaluation	''We cannot stop the flow of people coming and going,'' Christophe Chaboud, France's antiterrorism coordinator, said last month.
Distant_Evaluation	''The idea is to single out potentially dangerous individuals, which means intense investigation.
Distant_Evaluation	They are difficult to identify through the huge flow.''

Main	DAR ES SALAAM, Sept. 23 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister Kassim Majaliwa said on Sunday police have arrested a number of people who were in relation to a ferry disaster killing over 220 people in Lake Victoria.
Main	"""Police have arrested a number of people for questioning following the grisly marine accident as investigations continue,"" said Majaliwa at the national burial of nine victims who were not identified by relatives."
Cause_General	About 216 victims have already been identified by relatives and their bodies collected for burial.
Cause_General	The official made the remarks at Ukara Island where the nine were buried that he will soon announce names of members of an investigation team formed by the government.
Cause_General	On Friday, Tanzanian President Magufuli announced a four-day mourning period for the victims of the ferry accident.
Cause_Specific	According to sources, the ferry, with a capacity of 101 passengers and 25 tonnes of cargo, capsized at around 1 p.m. local time Thursday.
Cause_General	Magufuli also ordered the arrest of safety inspectors from the country's transport regulator, the Surface and Marine Transport Regulatory Authority.
Cause_General	Preliminary investigations showed that the state-owned ferry was overloaded with more than 200 passengers and was being manned by someone who was not the authorized captain of the vessel.
Cause_General	Isack Kamwelwe, the Minister for Works, Transport and Communication, said 225 bodies were recovered from the fateful ferry between Thursday and Sunday morning.
Cause_General	"""We are still searching for more bodies before we halt the recovery operation later today,"" said Kamwelwe, adding that the recovery operation will be halted after the ferry was pulled out of the waters from one of Africa's great lakes."
Cause_General	A team of experts from the Tanzania People's Defence Forces (TPDF) and the police force arrived at Ukara Islet, the scene of the accident, on Saturday night to pull out the ferry using state-of-the-art equipment from TPDF, said Kamwelwe.
Cause_General	One survivor was rescued on Saturday morning from the ferry that capsized in Lake Victoria on Thursday afternoon.
Cause_General	Kamwelwe identified the survivor as Alphonce Charahani, a ferry engineer who was among the passengers, saying he was in critical condition and doctors are fighting to save his life.
Distant_Historical	The last major ferry accident on Lake Victoria occurred in 1996 in the same region, killing at least 500 people.
Main	Recent interrogations of arrested members of Hamas in the West Bank town of Qalqilya produced information that the Islamic organization there was planning imminent terrorist attacks against Israel, including one using a large truck bomb, the Israeli Shin Bet internal security service said Tuesday.
Cause_General	Hamas, which is now the dominant faction in the Palestinian government, has not conducted suicide attacks within Israel since 2004 and has been committed to an Israeli-Palestinian cease-fire agreement in the Gaza Strip since November.
Cause_General	People who usually speak for Hamas would not react to the Shin Bet report on Tuesday, apparently in an attempt to not lend the allegations any credence.
Distant_Evaluation	Some observers have pointed to a growing split within Hamas between those in the government who are seeking international recognition and want to refrain from attacking Israel and more hard-line members.
Distant_Evaluation	Hamas has denied that such a division exists.
Main	According to a rare public statement by Shin Bet, its agents found out about what they said were plans for suicide attacks from Qalqilya after interrogating detainees and learning of the truck bomb.
Cause_Specific	Shin Bet said it was told that a would-be suicide bomber had driven a truck packed with about 220 pounds of explosives to the Tel Aviv area in March, but for unspecified reasons, the attack was not carried out.
Cause_General	The truck returned to Qalqilya, and later blew up there in what Shin Bet termed a ''work accident.''
Cause_Specific	Shin Bet said that 19 members of the Hamas network in Qalqilya were arrested in March, which it said thwarted plans to carry out attacks during the recent Passover holiday.
Distant_Evaluation	The statement went on to warn that Hamas operatives in Qalqilya ''continue to work on the planning and execution of significant attacks, including ones in the immediate future.''
Cause_General	The truck bomb was many times larger than bombs that have been used to explode Israeli buses.
Distant_Evaluation	In the wake of the Shin Bet statement, David Baker, an official in the office of Israel's prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said Hamas ''continues to target Israeli civilians.
Distant_Evaluation	''Terrorism is a cornerstone of the new Palestinian government, a government that should be shunned,'' he said.
Cause_General	In March, Hamas joined with the more mainstream Fatah faction in a unity government.
Cause_General	Israel maintains a complete boycott of the government, and has been calling on the international community to do the same, with limited success.
Cause_General	The United States and Europe are maintaining contacts with the non-Hamas ministers, and a senior British diplomat met with Prime Minister Ismail Haniya of Hamas last week on what was described as a humanitarian mission to help secure the release of a British journalist kidnapped in Gaza.
Distant_Historical	Hamas was at the vanguard of Palestinian suicide bombing campaigns in Israel, starting in the 1990s.
Distant_Evaluation	But all recent suicide bombings in Israel have been carried out by the smaller, more extreme Islamic Jihad group, according to Israeli security officials.
Cause_General	The Palestinian unity government guidelines refer to the Palestinians' ''legitimate right'' to resistance ''in all its forms,'' but also speak of extending the cease-fire from Gaza to the West Bank.
Cause_General	There have long been differences between the more pragmatic political leaders of Hamas, who now sit in government, and the military underground that is believed to answer to more hard-line leaders in exile.
Distant_Anecdotal	A senior Israeli Army commander, speaking on condition of anonymity, said recently that in Israel's assessment, Hamas had not changed its policy regarding attacks in Israel, but that there were ''some groups in the military wing of Hamas that don't like the cease-fire or the unity government.''
Cause_General	On March 19, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, the military underground of Hamas, claimed responsibility for the shooting and wounding of an Israeli Electric Corporation employee who was working inside Israel near the Gaza border fence.
Cause_General	That was the first attack of any kind claimed by Hamas since November.
Distant_Evaluation	Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, denied any divisions in Hamas over the unity government and dismissed such talk as ''Israeli propaganda aimed at trying to bring about Hamas's collapse.''
Distant_Historical	A Hamas-orchestrated suicide bombing in the Park Hotel in the coastal city of Netanya on the eve of Passover in 2002 killed 30, and precipitated Israel's reinvasion of the Palestinian cities of the West Bank.
Distant_Historical	Shortly afterward, the Israeli cabinet approved the construction of the West Bank security barrier, following intense public pressure to find a way of keeping suicide bombers out.
Cause_Specific	The driver of the explosive-laden truck sent recently to Tel Aviv was able to pass through a gate in the barrier, exploiting the fact that he holds an Israeli identification card because his father is married to an Israeli citizen, Shin Bet said.
Cause_Specific	The truck also had Israeli license plates, the statement said.
Cause_General	It did not indicate who the driver was or what had happened to him.
Distant_Evaluation	According to Israeli military officials, the Hamas infrastructure is particularly developed in Qalqilya, where Hamas won all the seats in local council elections in 2005.
Main	(Reuters) - Texas police on Saturday arrested a veteran U.S. Border Patrol agent, who is suspected of killing four women within the past two weeks and kidnapping a fifth.
Cause_Specific	Juan David Ortiz, a 35-year-old who has worked for the Border Patrol for a decade, was found hiding in a Laredo parking lot after a woman he allegedly abducted was able to escape and alert law enforcement, officials said.
Distant_Evaluation	“We feel that our efforts have gathered strong evidence against this killer.
Distant_Evaluation	Our community is safe from this killer,” Webb County Sheriff Martin Cuellar said in a statement.
Cause_General	Ortiz was charged late on Saturday with four counts of murder, aggravated assault and unlawful restraint, Webb County, Texas District Attorney Isidro Alaniz said in a tweet.
Cause_General	It was unclear if Ortiz had an attorney or if bond was set.
Cause_General	The four victims’ names were not immediately disclosed.
Cause_General	Local media in Laredo, 150 miles (240 km) southwest of San Antonio, said they had been working as prostitutes.
Cause_General	The bodies of two of the women were discovered this month along Interstate 35 in rural northwest Webb County, the Laredo Morning Times reported, while the third and fourth were found in the same area this weekend.
Distant_Evaluation	A senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) official, Andrew Meehan, said in a statement the agency was cooperating fully with the investigators.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While it was not agency policy to comment on the details of an ongoing investigation, Meehan said, criminal conduct by CBP employees is not, and will not be, tolerated.
Distant_Evaluation	“Our sincerest condolences go out to the victims’ family and friends,” Meehan added.
Main	KOETHEN, Germany (Reuters) - A 22-year-old German man died overnight in the eastern town of Koethen and two Afghans have been detained on suspicion of killing him, the police and the public prosecutor’s office said on Sunday.
Main	The police and the public prosecutor’s office said in a short statement: “Two Afghans were provisionally detained on suspicion of homicide ...
Main	The reasons for, and concrete circumstances of, the incident are not yet known.”
Cause_General	News of the death followed the killing of another German man in the city of Chemnitz, southeast of Koethen, for which two asylum seekers - a Syrian and an Iraqi - were arrested.
Cause_General	The most violent right-wing protests in decades followed the Aug. 26 killing in Chemnitz.
Main_Consequence	At dusk in Koethen, both far-right and left-wing protesters began assembling to demonstrate.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The state premier of Saxony-Anhalt, home to Koethen, said protests there must not turn out like those in Chemnitz.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Despite all the emotional, every attempt to turn Koethen, as is being said on the internet, into a second Chemnitz, must be rejected,” the Mitteldeutsche Zeitung newspaper quoted state premier Reiner Haseloff as saying.
Cause_Specific	In its online edition, the paper identified the man who died in Koethen as Markus B. and said he died of acute heart failure.
Distant_Evaluation	Germany is deeply divided over Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 2015 decision to allow in over a million migrants, many of them refugees from wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.
Cause_General	A row over the veracity of reports that supporters of the far right hounded migrants in Chemnitz has inflamed tensions over immigration in Merkel’s ‘grand coalition’ only two months after she reached a truce with her Bavarian sister party on the same issue.
Distant_Evaluation	Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, of the Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU), on Wednesday said: “Migration is the mother of all problems.”
Main	MULTAN, Pakistan – An Indian man on death row in Pakistan for espionage has died after being attacked by fellow inmates, Pakistan’s state television said early Thursday.
Main	Sarabjit Singh, 51, died in a hospital in the eastern city of Lahore, where he had been in a coma for at least five days.
Distant_Historical	Singh was convicted of espionage in relation to bombings in two Pakistani cities in 1990.
Distant_Evaluation	His fate has been a source of tension between Pakistan and India since he was attacked Friday.
Distant_Evaluation	In a statement, the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, said he was “deeply saddened” by Sarabjit Singh’s death, describing him as a “brave son of India.”
Distant_Evaluation	Singh, the prime minister, criticized the Pakistani government’s refusal to repatriate the injured prisoner to India for emergency treatment.
Cause_Specific	According to the Pakistani police, Sarabjit Singh was assaulted by two prisoners as he left his cell at Kot Lakhpat jail, outside Lahore, to exercise last Friday.
Cause_Specific	He suffered severe head injuries and was later taken to the city’s Jinnah hospital in critical condition.
Distant_Anecdotal	Singh’s Pakistani lawyer said that his client had previously spoken of threats from inmates following the hanging of Afzal Guru, an accused Kashmiri militant, by the Indian authorities in February.
Distant_Historical	Singh was convicted of spying and for his involvement in a series of bomb blasts that killed 14 people in the Punjabi cities of Faisalabad and Lahore in 1990.
Distant_Historical	In 2006, Singh’s sister appealed to Pervez Musharraf, who was then Pakistan’s president, to grant him clemency and repatriate him to India.
Distant_Historical	That petition was dismissed by Musharraf and the Pakistani courts.
Distant_Historical	Singh then wrote to President Asif Ali Zardari in July 2009, requesting a pardon on humanitarian grounds.

Main	Jacques Vergès, the French lawyer who embraced anti-colonial causes and the role of devil’s advocate on a world stage to defend war criminals, terrorists, dictators and other notorious villains of the 20th century, died Thursday in Paris.
Cause_General	He was 88.
Cause_Specific	The cause was a heart attack at around 8 p.m. as he was preparing to dine with friends, according to his publisher, Éditions Pierre-Guillaume de Roux.
Main	He died in the Parisian house where the Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire once lived, the publisher said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“The ideal place for the last theatrical act that was the death of this born actor who, like Voltaire, cultivated the art of permanent revolt and volte-face,” the statement said, reflecting the lawyer’s reputation for asking disturbing questions on behalf of notorious clients.
Distant_Evaluation	Is a killer a terrorist or a patriot?
Distant_Evaluation	Can laws be used to judge good and evil?
Cause_General	For more than 50 years, Vergès raised such questions in defense of clients who claimed to be acting for political causes, although they were charged with genocide, crimes against humanity, bombings, hijackings and the murder of innocents.
Cause_General	They included the Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie; the terrorist Ilich Ramírez Sánchez, aka Carlos the Jackal; and Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge head of state, Khieu Samphan.
Cause_General	Vergès also sought to defend former presidents Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who was executed for crimes against humanity, and Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, who represented himself in a war-crimes trial but died before a verdict.
Distant_Evaluation	Like many of his clients, Vergès, the son of a Vietnamese woman and a French diplomat, was an enigma.
Cause_General	Assassins targeted him.
Cause_General	There were hints of ties to secret services, to terrorists he defended and to Mao Zedong, Che Guevara and other revolutionaries.
Cause_General	He was a confidant of Pol Pot, the tyrant blamed for the deaths of at least 1.7 million Cambodians.
Distant_Historical	He married a terrorist he saved from the guillotine, but left her and his two children and disappeared for eight years.
Distant_Historical	“He’s a slippery man,” director Barbet Schroeder, who made “Terror’s Advocate,” a 2007 documentary on Vergès and terrorism as a political weapon, told The New York Times in 2007.
Distant_Historical	“You can never touch him.
Distant_Historical	He loves the mystery.
Distant_Historical	The reason is that there are certain things he cannot talk about.
Distant_Historical	He would be in deep trouble if the truth came out.”
Distant_Historical	In a career that paralleled the postwar disintegration of colonial empires in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, Vergès rose to prominence in the late 1950s defending Algerians accused of terrorist bombings.
Distant_Historical	Instead of contesting the evidence of French prosecutors in court, he insisted that the defendants were resistance fighters in a just war of liberation and challenged the legal and moral legitimacy of the trials.
Distant_Historical	While most of his clients were convicted, the trials drew international attention to Vergès, and long after Algerian independence in 1962 his tactics served as a blueprint for his cases, which became public platforms to indict France and other Western nations for what he called crimes of racist colonialism and the exploitation of Third World peoples.
Distant_Historical	In the late 1960s, Vergès broadened his horizons, defending Palestinians charged with attacks on El Al aircraft in Athens and Zurich.
Distant_Historical	He later represented members of the Red Army Faction in Germany, whose bombings he called the work of “soldiers in a noble cause.”
Distant_Evaluation	Vergès’ most famous case was his defense of Klaus Barbie, the wartime Gestapo leader known as “the Butcher of Lyons” for his role in the torture, execution and deportation to death camps of thousands of French citizens.
Distant_Historical	After years in hiding, during which he is believed to have assisted Western intelligence services, Barbie was extradited from Bolivia to France in 1983.
Distant_Historical	At his war-crimes trial in 1987, Barbie walked out, refusing to hear testimony of his horrors.
Distant_Historical	Vergès virtually ignored the charges, and attacked Israel, France and other nations for committing “crimes against humanity” that he called “more serious” than those ascribed to Barbie.
Distant_Evaluation	Critics said he trivialized genocide to defend a monster.
Distant_Historical	Barbie was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, where he died in 1991.
Distant_Historical	“I practice the 'defense de la rupture,'” Vergès told The New York Times during his work on the Barbie case, meaning a tactic of confrontation with the judicial system rather than one that works within it.
Distant_Historical	“My law is to be against all laws.
Distant_Historical	My morality is to be against all morality.”
Distant_Historical	Jacques Vergès and his twin brother, Paul, were born March 5, 1925, in Ubon Ratchathani, Siam, now Thailand.
Distant_Historical	Their Vietnamese mother died when they were 3 and their father, Raymond Vergès, a French diplomat, raised them on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion.
Distant_Historical	Paul became a founder of the Réunion Communist Party and a member of the European Parliament.
Distant_Historical	In 1942, with his father’s encouragement, Jacques sailed to England, joined Charles de Gaulle’s Free French Forces and fought in the Resistance.
Distant_Historical	After the war, he studied law at the University of Paris, joined the Communist Party and in 1949 became a leader of an anti-colonial student movement.
Distant_Historical	His student friends included Khieu Samphan and Saloth Sar, the future Pol Pot.
Distant_Historical	In the early 1950s Vergès led a Communist youth organization in Prague.
Distant_Historical	Returning to Paris, he became a lawyer in 1955 and gained fame defending Algerian guerrilla fighters.
Distant_Historical	In a notorious case, Djamila Bouhired was convicted in 1957 of killing 11 people in an Algiers bombing and sentenced to death.
Distant_Historical	As she awaited the guillotine, it was revealed that she had been tortured during questioning.
Distant_Historical	Vergès campaigned for a reprieve.
Distant_Historical	Many world leaders, including the Soviet leader, Nikita Khrushchev, demanded her release.
Distant_Historical	Her execution was postponed, and in 1962 she was released.
Distant_Historical	In 1965, Vergès and Bouhired were married.
Distant_Historical	They had two children, Meriem and Liess.
Distant_Historical	The couple founded a popular magazine, Révolution, in 1968.
Distant_Historical	In 1970, Vergès disappeared.
Distant_Historical	His whereabouts remained a mystery, although he was rumored to be in Cambodia with Pol Pot and in the Middle East with Palestinian groups.
Distant_Historical	He reappeared in Paris in 1978 and resumed his law practice.
Distant_Historical	His ties to Carlos the Jackal were murky but probably dated to 1982, when he defended Magdalena Kopp, the terrorist’s girlfriend and accomplice (and later his wife), who was caught with explosives in Paris.
Distant_Historical	Wanted for many terrorist acts in the name of Palestinian liberation in the 1970s and '80s, Carlos was captured by French agents in Sudan in 1994 and flown to Paris.
Distant_Historical	Vergès called it a kidnapping and represented Carlos in the early stages of his case, but they had a falling out over tactics.
Distant_Historical	The Venezuelan-born terrorist hired other lawyers, was convicted in 1997 and sentenced to life in prison.
Distant_Historical	The verdict and sentence were affirmed in another trial years later.
Distant_Historical	After Saddam Hussein was captured in 2003, Vergès, who had been hired to defend other ousted Iraqi leaders, offered to represent him.
Distant_Historical	The family of the deposed Iraqi leader chose another lawyer, and Saddam was executed in 2006.
Distant_Historical	Vergès also offered to defend Milosevic, but he chose to represent himself in a trial that began in The Hague in 2002.
Distant_Historical	Milosevic died in 2006 before the case could be concluded.
Distant_Historical	In 2008, as Khieu Samphan made his first appearance before Cambodia’s genocide tribunal, Vergès, representing his old friend, created a tumultuous scene and stormed out after erupting at a panel of judges because documents for the pretrial hearing had not been translated into French.
Distant_Historical	He argued that his client had held no real power as Cambodians had died of starvation, disease, forced labor and massacres during the brutal Khmer Rouge drive to create a classless society.
Distant_Historical	He insisted that the power - and responsibility for the Cambodian tragedy - belonged to Pol Pot, who died in 1998.

Main	JERUSALEM - Israel published bids Sunday for the construction of more than 1,000 housing units in contested areas of East Jerusalem and several large West Bank settlements, intensifying the already charged atmosphere three days before the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks here and hours before Israel was to announce the names of Palestinian prisoners to be released this week.
Distant_Evaluation	While the planning and building of settlements have continued in the months preceding the talks, causing constant friction, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new governing coalition had so far refrained from issuing construction bids since it was formed in March.
Cause_General	The publishing of bids is the final bureaucratic stage before new construction can begin.
Cause_General	Uri Ariel, the housing minister, announced the contentious move while Netanyahu was recovering in a hospital after overnight surgery for a hernia.
Distant_Evaluation	“The government of Israel is working to bring down the cost of living in all parts of the country,” Ariel, a member of the pro-settlement Jewish Home Party, said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“No country in the world accepts dictates from other countries about where it is allowed to build and where not,” he continued, responding to the international condemnation of Israel’s continuing efforts to build up the settlements.
Cause_General	The prime minister’s office offered no immediate comment.
Distant_Evaluation	The settlement move appeared intended to appease the right-wing members of the Israeli government ahead of the expected release this week of 26 Palestinian prisoners who have served 20 years or more in prison for deadly attacks against Israelis.
Cause_General	Later on Sunday, a ministerial committee was expected to complete the list of those to be released on Tuesday.
Distant_Evaluation	The decision to release 104 prisoners over the coming months is deeply unpopular in Israel.
Distant_Evaluation	Netanyahu has explained it as a gesture that was necessary to persuade the Palestinian leadership to agree to resume long-stalled negotiations and that was preferable to acceding to other Palestinian demands like a settlement freeze.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But it appears that the talks Wednesday will be taking place amid a storm of mutual recrimination.
Distant_Evaluation	Muhammad Shtayyeh, a senior Palestinian negotiator, issued a statement Sunday saying, “It is clear that the Israeli government is deliberately attempting to sabotage U.S. and international efforts to resume negotiations.” Israel, he continued, “continues to use peace negotiations as a smoke screen for more settlement construction.”

Distant_Evaluation	A strict diet, designed for medical purposes, is just part of the deal.
Distant_Evaluation	That includes hiding the salt shaker and steering clear of alcohol.
Distant_Evaluation	Smoking is out of the question, and frequenting the gym whenever your body is agreeable would also qualify as part of the routine.
Distant_Evaluation	When you are waiting on a kidney transplant to prolong your life, you accept certain hassles along the way.
Distant_Evaluation	Ronald Yaffe expected all of that.
Distant_Evaluation	Here’s what he did not expect:
Main	A yearlong battle with Wells Fargo concerning $10,000 in cashier’s checks from the 1980s that the bank says it is not obligated to pay.
Distant_Evaluation	''I’m mad.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This has gotten personal, and I’m not going to let it go,'' Yaffe said Monday.
Distant_Evaluation	''Who would ever think that if you give your money to a bank, they won’t give it back to you when you ask for it?''
Distant_Historical	This story begins more than 30 years ago when Yaffe began turning his spare cash into cashier’s checks at Central Fidelity Bank in Richmond, Va., where he was an optometrist.
Distant_Evaluation	The idea, he said, was to have emergency funds to take with him on long sailing trips.
Distant_Historical	The checks, totaling $11,800, went unused and Yaffe stashed them in a safe deposit box when he retired to Sarasota a short time later.
Distant_Historical	With his medical condition worsening and a transplant or dialysis likely, Yaffe, 73, retrieved the checks last year, figuring his prescription costs would soon skyrocket.
Cause_Specific	He deposited the funds in an account, but Wells Fargo soon notified him that the checks were invalid.
Cause_Specific	The bank, Yaffe said, told him they could not find the necessary paper trail.
Distant_Historical	Central Fidelity was sold to Wachovia in 1998, and Wachovia was acquired by Wells Fargo in 2009.
Cause_General	The Virginia Department of Treasury found a record for one of the checks in unclaimed funds and sent Yaffe $1,800.
Distant_Historical	The agency said the other $10,000 was reclaimed by Central Fidelity in 1987, according to Sarasota’s Herald-Tribune, which originally reported the story.
Cause_Specific	That’s when Yaffe took the matter to court, and won a judgment last month for the $10,000 plus interest accrued from the time he tried to deposit the checks.
Cause_General	Wells Fargo has since filed an appeal, saying Florida law has a five-year statute of limitations on cashier’s checks.
Distant_Evaluation	''We are abiding by the law,'' said Wells Fargo spokeswoman Kathy Harrison.
Distant_Evaluation	''The judge in this case elected to ignore the case law that supports it.
Distant_Evaluation	It’s an unfortunate situation, and now that it’s in litigation, there is not much more we can do or say.''
Cause_General	Today’s cashier’s checks typically carry disclaimers saying they will be voided if not cashed in a specified period of time, often 90 days or six months.
Distant_Evaluation	Yaffe said there were no time limits written on his checks in 1982.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Even if the judgment is upheld in appeals, Yaffe says a portion of the $10,000 will go to attorney fees.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And so a sick man might lose a large chunk of money, and a bank risks looking greedy and coldhearted.
Distant_Evaluation	At this point Wells Fargo would be justified if it was worried about setting a legal precedent, but a little compassion a year ago could have avoided the whole mess.

Cause_General	CAIRO - At least three people were killed and hundreds were injured across Egypt on Friday, as anti-government protesters ransacked Muslim Brotherhood offices and tens of thousands of supporters and opponents of President Mohammed Morsi held dueling rallies in the capital.
Cause_General	While the protests in Cairo remained peaceful, deadly clashes erupted in the port city of Alexandria, where protesters set fire to the Brotherhood’s headquarters.
Main	Security officials said that among the victims was a U.S. citizen, a man stabbed to death near the headquarters.
Distant_Evaluation	The security official said it was not clear who had attacked the man, and the official was not able to provide information about a second victim in the city.
Main	A State Department spokesman, Patrick Ventrell, confirmed that a U.S. citizen was killed in Alexandria but said he had no further information.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The violence Friday provided a dark prelude to planned mass protests Sunday by Morsi’s opponents, who are demanding that the president step down and early elections be held.
Distant_Evaluation	Fears about possible violence at the marches have preoccupied the country for weeks and further split Egypt’s deeply polarized political class.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In recent days, both the army and Egypt’s highest religious authority have warned about the potential for deadly civil strife.
Cause_General	On Friday, the United States warned its citizens to defer “nonessential” travel to Egypt and said it was allowing some of its embassy employees and their families to leave the country because of the political unrest.
Cause_General	At least seven people have been killed in violent episodes over the past three days outside Cairo.
Cause_General	The Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt’s largest Islamist party and the movement that brought Morsi to power, said several of its supporters were killed in attacks on its offices and on mosques.
Cause_General	In Cairo, tens of thousands of people took to the streets in competing protests that remained separate, and as a result, largely peaceful.
Cause_General	Anti-government protesters gathered in Tahrir Square, around the Defense Ministry and in front of the presidential palace, which has been ringed with new barriers, including concrete blocks and shipping containers.
Distant_Evaluation	Calls for Morsi to resign have intensified as Egypt lurches from crisis to crisis, the most recent one over the endless gas lines that have clogged roads around the country.
Main	LONDON - Tony Hayward was appointed interim chairman of the mining company Glencore Xstrata on Thursday, almost three years after he resigned as chief executive of BP in the wake of a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.
Cause_Specific	The appointment of Hayward, currently a senior independent director at the company, comes after the departure of Glencore Xstrata’s chairman, John Bond, who failed to receive enough shareholder support at an investor meeting Thursday to retain his position.
Distant_Evaluation	The new role represents a significant turnaround for Hayward, who was widely criticized for his role in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010.
Cause_General	Since leaving BP, Hayward has become chief executive of Genel Energy, which is exploring for energy reserves in northern Iraq.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Hayward will step down from his new position at Glencore Xstrata as soon as a new chairman is appointed, according to a company statement.
Cause_General	The executive shuffle at the top of Glencore Xstrata is the most recent management change after the commodities giant Glencore International completed its $30 billion all-stock takeover of the mining company Xstrata on May 2.
Cause_General	As part of the deal, Xstrata’s chief executive, Mick Davis, announced that he was leaving the merged company earlier than had been expected, while a number of his top lieutenants have also departed.
Cause_General	Steve Robson, a company director, announced his resignation Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	Bond, 71, a former chief executive and chairman of the British bank HSBC, had previously said he would step down as Glencore Xstrata chairman as soon as a successor could be found.
Cause_General	He had faced anger in November when shareholders voted against multimillion-dollar bonuses that were aimed at retaining some of Xstrata’s senior managers.
Cause_General	On Thursday, however, Bond, who received less than 20 percent approval from investors to be reappointed chairman, told shareholders he did not have enough support to continue in his role.
Distant_Evaluation	“I recognize and respect the strong opposition among many to the retention arrangements which the board felt appropriate to ensure management stability,” Bond said in a statement, in reference to the vetoed bonuses.
Cause_General	The changes come as the chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, has announced plans to reduce costs at Glencore Xstrata.
Main	RIO DE JANEIRO – The Brazilian police have arrested a businessman listed by the United States as a member of Hezbollah, the powerful Lebanese militant group, under suspicion of operating a fraudulent scheme in the clothing industry – a far cry from the arms, drugs, explosives and counterfeit bills that U.S. officials have suspected him of trafficking in the past.
Main	Officials with Brazil’s Civil Police said the suspect, Hamzi Ahmad Barakat, 50, a Lebanese citizen with ties to the Triple Frontier region of Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay, was arrested Thursday in the city of Curitiba in southern Brazil in connection with creating a network of front companies to defraud Lebanese immigrants who had recently arrived in Brazil.
Distant_Evaluation	The arrest focuses new attention on the Triple Frontier, a smuggler’s haven that has long been under the scrutiny of intelligence agencies from the United States, Israel and South American nations.
Distant_Historical	In 2006, the Treasury Department designated Barakat as a member of Hezbollah and said he owned and managed a store in Paraguay that “served as a source of funding” for the group, which the United States considers a terrorist organization.
Cause_General	Cassiano Aufiero, the police investigator in charge of the case, said that officials were aware that Barakat had been linked to Hezbollah but added that their investigation was in connection to other activities.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Aufiero said that charges against Barakat would include embezzlement and creating false documents in schemes involving the resale of clothing.
Distant_Evaluation	“He was preying on his own countrymen, using their identities to create companies to carry out schemes,” Aufiero said.
Cause_General	Barakat has been held in a state penitentiary in Curitiba since his arrest, he said.
Cause_General	John Sullivan, a spokesman for the Treasury Department in Washington, says that the description of Barakat as a Hezbollah member still stands.
Distant_Evaluation	After the Treasury Department described the links of Barakat and eight others in the Triple Frontier region to Hezbollah, Brazil’s government responded by saying that there were no signs of terrorism financing in the border region, which has long attracted large numbers of immigrants from the Middle East.
Distant_Historical	In 2004, the Treasury Department called Barakat’s brother, Assad Ahmad Barakat, one of Hezbollah’s “most prominent and influential members,” and said he used an electronics wholesale store in the Triple Frontier as a cover for raising funds for Hezbollah.
Distant_Historical	Brazilian police arrested Assad Ahmad Barakat in 2002 and deported him to Paraguay, where he went to prison for tax evasion.
Main	The city of Detroit, which has filed for bankruptcy, has formally hired the international auction house Christie’s to appraise part of the city-owned art collection held by the Detroit Institute of Arts, the auction house said Monday.
Distant_Evaluation	A decision about whether to sell the art to satisfy creditors has not been made, city officials have said, although all the city’s assets are being evaluated in light of the situation in Detroit, the largest U.S. city ever to file for bankruptcy.
Cause_Specific	Christie’s representatives had previously visited the museum in early June and confirmed Monday that the company had been hired to appraise the collection but gave no details about which portion of the collection it would be looking at.
Distant_Evaluation	“Christie’s was asked to assist due to our expertise in this area across all fine art categories and eras,” it said in its statement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It said, “In addition we will also assist and advise on how to realize value for the City while leaving the art in the City’s ownership.”
Main_Consequence	The office of Detroit emergency manager Kevyn Orr will pay Christie’s $200,000 for the appraisal, which is expected to be completed by mid-October, the Detroit Free Press reported on its website.
Distant_Evaluation	Christie’s will appraise only artworks that are clearly owned by the city and that are not bound by donor restrictions that might rule out a possible sale, the newspaper said, citing Orr’s spokesman Bill Nowling.

Main	SEOUL, South Korea - The children of a former military dictator of South Korea, Chun Doo-hwan, said Tuesday that they will pay 167 billion won ($154 million) that their father owed the government in fines.
Main_Consequence	Their decision closes a chapter on South Korea’s prolonged struggle with the legacy of one of its most brutal former leaders.
Distant_Historical	Chun, then an army major general, came to power in a coup in 1979 following the assassination of another military-backed strongman, President Park Chung-hee, who was the father of the current South Korean leader, President Park Geun-hye.
Distant_Historical	Chun ruled until 1988, when he was succeeded by Roh Tae-woo, his partner in the 1979 coup.
Distant_Historical	After South Korea’s transition to democracy, both Chun and Roh were convicted on charges of treason for their roles in the coup and a 1980 military crackdown on a pro-democracy uprising in the southern city of Kwangju that left hundreds dead.
Distant_Historical	They were also convicted of collecting huge bribes from big business while in office.
Distant_Historical	In 1997, Chun was sentenced to life in prison and Roh to 17 years.
Cause_General	Although they were later pardoned and freed, Chun and Roh had failed to pay the 220.5 billion won ($203 million) and 268.8 billion won ($248 million) that they were fined, respectively.
Cause_General	Chun has so far paid only a quarter of his fine, claiming to have only 290,000 won ($267), in his bank accounts.
Distant_Evaluation	But opposition lawmakers have said he might have huge assets stashed away.
Distant_Evaluation	“We bow deeply in apology,” Chun Jae-kook, the eldest son of Chun, said in a family statement that he read Tuesday.
Distant_Evaluation	He said Chun’s three sons and daughter would give up buildings, land and paintings and other assets to help pay their father’s fine.
Distant_Evaluation	He said the house where Chun and his wife live would also be sold to help pay the fine, though he asked government officials to let his parents live there until they die.
Cause_General	Chun is 82.
Cause_General	Lee Jin-han, a senior prosecutor, told reporters that the assets prosecutors have secured so far from Chun’s family members, including those they said they would give up on Tuesday, amounted to 170 billion won ($156 million) enough to cover Chun’s unpaid fine.
Cause_General	Earlier this month, Roh paid off his fine.
Cause_General	His brother and a businessman whose daughter divorced Roh’s son helped him pay the 23 billion won ($21 million) he still owed the government in fines.
Distant_Historical	SAN FRANCISCO - T-Mobile US, the fourth-largest U.S. carrier, lost thousands of customers over the past few years to rivals that offered cooler phones.
Distant_Evaluation	But it appears to be getting its groove back.
Main	The company Thursday said it had gained 1.1 million customers, including 685,000 contract subscribers, over its second quarter.
Distant_Historical	That compares with losing 557,000 contract subscribers, the most valuable type of customer, in the same period a year ago.
Main	The uptick represents its largest customer growth in four years.
Distant_Historical	The company, based in Bellevue, Wash., only started offering the iPhone in April, when it also began offering new phone plans that address common frustrations with wireless companies, like confusing contracts and expensive data plans.
Distant_Evaluation	“By fixing the things that drive them mad, like contracts and upgrades, and freeing them from the two-year sentences imposed on them by our competitors, they are choosing the new T-Mobile in unprecedented numbers,” John Legere, the chief executive of T-Mobile US, said in a news release.
Distant_Evaluation	Over the past several years, T-Mobile lost many customers largely because it lacked the iPhone, and customers were unhappy with its service.
Cause_Specific	But this year has been jam-packed with change for the company: It finally landed a deal with Apple to sell the iPhone, it began an overhaul of its network and it started offering lower-cost plans to lure customers from competitors.
Cause_Specific	The company also has extra muscle from its merger with the smaller carrier MetroPCS, which was completed in May.
Cause_General	The change is costing T-Mobile.
Cause_General	The company posted a loss of $16 million for the quarter, compared with a profit of $207 million last year in the same period.
Cause_General	But it also reported revenue of $6.23 billion, up from $4.9 billion last year.
Cause_General	The net income was above the expectations of Wall Street analysts.
Cause_General	They had expected revenue of $6.01 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters.
Distant_Historical	In March, T-Mobile discontinued two-year contracts, instead allowing customers to buy a smartphone for a lower upfront cost and adding the cost of the device to their monthly bill.
Cause_General	It also continued to offer plans with unlimited data, an option that the top two carriers, Verizon Wireless and AT&T, killed years ago.
Cause_General	In general, T-Mobile’s plans are also cheaper than its competitors’ - for $70 a month, a customer can have unlimited minutes, text messages and data.
Cause_General	The plans offered by AT&T and Verizon cost upward of roughly $100 a month.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	T-Mobile expects the growth to continue.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	For the full year, it said it expected to add between 1 million and 1.2 million contract subscribers.

Main	LOS ANGELES - Just six months after declaring that “the prison crisis is over in California,” Gov.
Main	Jerry Brown is facing dire predictions about the future of the state’s prison system, one of the largest in the nation.
Cause_Specific	A widespread inmate hunger strike against California’s policy of solitary confinement was approaching its second week on Sunday.
Cause_Specific	The federal courts have demanded the release of nearly 10,000 inmates and the transfer of 2,600 others who are at risk of contracting a deadly disease in the state’s overcrowded prisons.
Cause_Specific	State lawmakers have called for an investigation into a new report that nearly 150 women behind bars were coerced into being sterilized over the last decade.
Cause_Specific	And last week, a federal judge ruled that prisoners were not receiving adequate medical care
Distant_Evaluation	“It is like a tinderbox, and all you had to do is light a match,” said Jules Lobel, the president of the Center for Constitutional Rights and the lead lawyer in a federal lawsuit over solitary confinement.
Distant_Evaluation	“They see the state has shown no willingness to change, even when the high court orders it.
Distant_Evaluation	They have decided to circle the wagons and keep the system that exists today as intact as possible.”
Distant_Evaluation	In many ways California prison system officials have been among the most reluctant to adapt systemic changes, experts say, doing so only when forced to by the federal courts.
Distant_Evaluation	Even then, lawyers and advocates for prisoners say, the changes have come slowly and unevenly.
Cause_General	Brown, a Democrat, has aggressively fought several federal court orders in the two years since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that conditions and overcrowding in the system amounted to a violation of the Eighth Amendment - cruel and unusual punishment.
Cause_Specific	Since then, federal judges overseeing the case have repeatedly declared that the state was not making changes quickly enough, and that conditions in the prisons remained appalling - that the state had been “deliberately indifferent.”
Cause_Specific	The judges have twice threatened to hold the governor in contempt if he does not comply with their order to release prisoners.
Cause_Specific	Last week, Brown appealed to the Supreme Court to stop the order, arguing that the system had already improved dramatically and that stopping the release of prisoners was essential for public safety.

Main	ISTANBUL - Turkish police Saturday used water cannons to scatter thousands of people who had gathered in Taksim Square here to commemorate four people killed during the nationwide anti-government protests that have gripped Turkey for more than two weeks.
Cause_Specific	Representatives of the peaceful protesters read a statement of their demands before turning to Gezi Park, the center of a campaign to save the only green patch in Istanbul’s center.
Cause_Specific	But that environmental campaign has quickly blossomed into a protest against Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s autocratic and dismissive reaction toward the protesters.
Cause_General	A few activists, representing Taksim Solidarity, an umbrella group, left red carnations at the entrance to Gezi Park, which has been blocked by the police since last Saturday.
Cause_General	Some members of the crowd threw carnations at police vehicles or attached them to their wired windows.
Cause_Specific	The police warned the crowd to disperse, but the protesters refused to leave Taksim Square and chanted anti-government slogans.
Main	Dozens of police officers then moved toward the crowd and began spraying the protesters with water cannons.
Cause_General	For the first time in more than 20 days, the police did not use tear gas to force protesters away from Taksim Square.
Cause_General	But the police did fire it at protesters on some side streets and at least one entrance to the square.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I was not standing on the road, which the police asked us to clear, so I thought I should be fine,” Gonul Duzer, a 24-year-old student, said as she held red carnations in her hand.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I wanted to hand these to them, but instead they pushed me away with their shields and said our right to protest was over.”
Cause_General	Demonstrators and passers-by sought shelter in nearby cafes that sealed off their windows, in case the police used tear gas, and emptied terraces overlooking the square.
Distant_Evaluation	On Saturday, Erdogan claimed that the protests were carried out “with malicious intentions.”
Distant_Evaluation	“You became the pawns in a dirty game and were deceived gravely,” he said, according to the semiofficial Anatolian news agency, referring to young activists who have been attending protests in more than 60 cities.
Distant_Evaluation	“Nobody but God will have the power to overthrow our government,” Erdogan said at a rally in Samsun, a town on the Black Sea coast.
Main	Marc Rich, the former fugitive oil trader and founder of the commodities trading giant Glencore International, died on Wednesday in Lucerne, Switzerland.
Cause_General	He was 78.
Cause_Specific	The cause was a brain stroke at a hospital, according to a statement from his spokesman.
Distant_Historical	Rich courted controversy throughout his colorful career, and was indicted by the U.S. in the early 1980s on charges of tax evasion and illegally trading with Iran.
Distant_Historical	After being one of the country’s most famous fugitives for the next two decades, Rich eventually received a pardon from President Bill Clinton on his last day in office in early 2001.
Distant_Historical	The pardon brought the oil trader back into the headlines after it was revealed that Rich’s former wife, Denise Eisenberg, had given donations to the Democratic Party in 2000, according to official records.
Distant_Historical	Despite his notoriety, Rich, whose net worth was estimated at $2.5 billion, continued to work in the commodities industry, and founded Marc Rich & Co., the precursor of Glencore International, the commodities trader, which he later sold to the company’s management team in 1993.
Distant_Historical	Rich was born in Antwerp, Belgium, but moved to New York with his family to escape the rise of the Nazis in Germany.
Distant_Historical	He began his career as a metals trader in the early 1970s, and gained prominence during the 1973-74 oil crisis when he circumvented the Arab oil embargo to sell oil to U.S. companies in desperate need of supplies at increasingly high prices.
Distant_Historical	He continued to buy oil from Iran after the country’s 1979 Islamic revolution despite U.S. sanctions against the country, and remained unapologetic about his activities.
Distant_Evaluation	“They respected the contracts,” Rich told Daniel Ammann, a Swiss journalist, in 2009, in reference to Iran’s national oil company.
Distant_Evaluation	“We performed a service for them.
Distant_Evaluation	We bought the oil, we handled the transport and we sold it.
Distant_Evaluation	They couldn’t do it themselves, so we were able to do it.”
Distant_Historical	His clients also included the apartheid regime of South Africa and the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
Distant_Historical	From 1973, Rich was similarly one of Israel’s most important oil suppliers for more than 20 years, and he held Israeli, Spanish and Belgian citizenship by the end of his life.
Distant_Historical	In 1983, he fled from the U.S. to Switzerland after he was indicted on charges of fraud, trading with Iran and evading almost $50 million in taxes.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	All told, the offenses would have led to more than 300 years in prison.
Distant_Evaluation	Over the years, Rich claimed that U.S. authorities had attempted several times to bring him to justice, including a plan, which was never carried out, to use a helicopter in Switzerland to capture him, according to a book published by Ammann in 2009.
Distant_Historical	After leaving the U.S. and renouncing his citizenship, Rich sold many of his domestic business interests, including 20th Century Fox to Rupert Murdoch for $250 million in 1984.
Cause_General	Glencore, the commodities company he founded, recently acquired the mining company Xstrata for around $30 billion, and has become a global giant in a number of commodities, including oil, iron ore and coal.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are saddened to hear of the death of Marc.
Distant_Evaluation	He was a friend and one of the great pioneers of the commodities trading industry,” Glencore-Xstrata’s current chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“Our deepest sympathies and condolences are with his family at this time.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He is expected to be buried in Israel on Thursday.
Cause_General	He is survived by two daughters, Ilona Schacter-Rich and Danielle Kilstock Rich.

Cause_General	SANTIAGO, Chile - The Chilean courts have long been after Ray E. Davis, a former U.S. Navy captain, accusing him of being involved in the murder of two Americans decades ago that inspired the award-winning 1982 film “Missing.”
Distant_Historical	A Chilean judge indicted Davis in 2011 and requested his extradition from the United States, where he was assumed to be living with his wife, Patricia.
Distant_Historical	The Chilean Supreme Court then authorized the extradition request in October.
Cause_General	But it turns out Davis may have been right under their noses all along, living in a nursing home in the Chilean capital.
Cause_Specific	Any attempts to haul him into court may now be too late; documents show that he recently died here.
Main_Consequence	The death of Davis, former commander of the U.S. Military Group at the embassy in Santiago, would leave many unanswered questions about the possible roles played by U.S. officials in the killings of Americans Charles Horman, 31, and Frank Teruggi, 24, while in military custody shortly after the 1973 military coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet.
Cause_General	It was the Horman case that is depicted in the film “Missing” by the director Costa-Gavras.
Distant_Historical	At the time of the indictment, Patricia Davis told The Associated Press that her husband had Alzheimer’s disease and was in a nursing home.
Distant_Historical	She did not explain, however, that the nursing home was in Santiago.
Cause_General	U.S. Embassy officials in Chile said they were unaware that Davis was living in Santiago until early May, when they were informed of his death a few days before.
Cause_General	Patricia Davis also confirmed her husband’s death in a telephone interview from Niceville, Fla., but declined to say where it had occurred.
Distant_Historical	A death certificate issued in Santiago says that a Ray E. Davis died of a “multisystemic failure” on April 30, at age 88.
Distant_Historical	Records at the Parque del Recuerdo cemetery in Santiago also show that a Ray E. Davis was cremated there but that his remains were taken elsewhere.
Distant_Evaluation	Charles Horman’s widow, Joyce, is unconvinced that it is the Ray Davis accused of involvement in her husband’s murder, and she has asked the U.S. Embassy to provide proof of the cancellation of the former captain’s pension.
Distant_Evaluation	“How is it that no one notified the Chilean court system or the U.S. Embassy that Ray Davis was in Chile, when it now looks like he had been in Chile for a year or so?” she said.
Main	MEXICO CITY - A former colonel in the Salvadoran military accused of planning the killing of six Jesuit priests during that country’s civil war has been sentenced to 21 months in a U.S. prison for immigration violations.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The sentence, handed down in Boston on Tuesday, could set the stage for his extradition to Spain, where he would be one of the few top-ranking officers to face trial in the 1989 killings.
Cause_General	Five of the six priests were Spanish, and Spain is seeking his extradition because it is unlikely that El Salvador - where an amnesty law has allowed other suspects in the crime to remain free - will prosecute him.
Distant_Evaluation	If convicted in Spain, he could face up to 30 years in prison.
Distant_Historical	The former colonel, Inocente Orlando Montano, 71, was El Salvador’s vice minister of public safety at the time of the killings, which brought international condemnation.
Distant_Historical	When he was arrested in 2011, he had been living in a Boston suburb for 10 years.
Distant_Historical	He pleaded guilty in September to charges of immigration fraud and perjury related to his application for temporary humanitarian status to remain legally in the United States.
Distant_Evaluation	Almudena Bernabéu, a lawyer with the Center for Justice and Accountability in San Francisco, which has pursued the case, said that the United States had indicated it would be amenable to extraditing Montano once he served his sentence for immigration fraud.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Extradition proceedings could take more than a year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“With the conclusion of this sentencing, the hope is that the United States will, in fact, revise and respond positively to the extradition request,” Bernabéu said.
Cause_General	Montano had been granted a special immigration status that shielded him from deportation, which he had received after lying about his military service and the date he entered the United States, prosecutors said.
Distant_Evaluation	An assistant U.S. attorney, John A. Capin, argued that Montano came to the United States to avoid criminal prosecution for his role in the killings.
Distant_Evaluation	Montano’s lawyer said that an amnesty was in effect when he left El Salvador, making the former colonel, who he said faced economic hardship at the time, immune to prosecution in his home country.
Distant_Historical	A 1993 U.N.
Distant_Historical	Truth Commission report named Montano a participant in the plot to kill the priests, whom military officers suspected of collaborating with left-wing guerrillas.
Distant_Historical	They, their housekeeper and her teenage daughter were killed in a raid on the Jesuit-run University of Central America in San Salvador.
Distant_Historical	In 2011, a Spanish National Court judge issued arrest warrants for 20 men, including Montano, suspected of participating in the slaying of the priests.
Distant_Historical	The judge also requested the extradition of 15 of the 20 - the main suspects - but the Salvadoran Supreme Court denied that request.
Distant_Evaluation	“The sentence of 21 months sends a message to human rights abusers that they cannot seek safe haven in the United States and avoid accountability for their actions,” said a statement from the Center for Justice and Accountability.

Error	DA pursues assault case vs. Celtics player © 2013 The New York Times
Main	The domestic assault case against Celtics forward Jared Sullinger will continue despite pleas from his girlfriend to drop the charges.
Cause_General	Sullinger, 21, was in Waltham District Court on Monday to face charges of assault and battery, destruction of property, and intimidation of a witness in an Aug. 31 conflict with his girlfriend, Deann Smith, at Sullinger’s Waltham residence.
Main	Sullinger’s lawyer, Charles Rankin, said Smith does not want to continue the case and is not fearful of Sullinger, but the Middlesex district attorney’s office is planning to pursue it.
Cause_General	Sullinger’s next pretrial hearing is Oct. 28, two days before the Celtics open the regular season against the Raptors at Toronto.
Distant_Evaluation	''The case is pending,'' said Stephanie Chelf Guyotte, director of communications for the Middlesex district attorney’s office.
Distant_Evaluation	''We believe we have evidence supporting the charges and we’re continuing to move forward.''
Cause_Specific	Sullinger, who is entering his second season with the Celtics, turned himself in Sept. 3.
Cause_Specific	He was released on $5,000 bail after pleading not guilty and was given a no-contact stipulation with Smith unless another party was involved.
Cause_Specific	Sullinger later released a statement through the team expressing embarrassment.
Cause_Specific	According to the police report, Sullinger and Smith had an argument when she found evidence on his cellphone that he had been unfaithful.
Cause_Specific	Sullinger allegedly pinned her down and damaged her cellphone before leaving the apartment.
Cause_General	After Sullinger was arrested, the Celtics released a statement saying the team was disappointed in him, but have not commented since.
Distant_Evaluation	The Celtics are scheduled to start training camp Sept. 30, and Sullinger is expected to participate.
Distant_Historical	He was limited to 45 games last season because of back surgery.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Sullinger may also face an NBA suspension, depending on the outcome of the case.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A settlement could be reached before Oct. 28.

Cause_General	Maps released by Wynn Resorts on Wednesday indicate that all of the company’s proposed Mystic River casino development lies within Everett, bolstering the company’s claim that the City of Boston is not a host community for the project and therefore cannot block it.
Cause_General	But Mayor Thomas M. Menino’s administration was not ready to give up, saying the Charlestown neighborhood near the proposed development should get to vote on whether to accept the Wynn proposal.
Distant_Evaluation	''It is easy to draw lines on a map and circumvent the boundaries of the city, but that doesn’t circumvent the impacts to the city,'' said Menino’s spokeswoman Dot Joyce.
Distant_Evaluation	''The city will continue to fight for the full protection of Charlestown and the people of Charlestown.''
Cause_General	Menino and Wynn are in an ongoing dispute over whether part of Wynn’s proposed resort is in Boston.
Distant_Evaluation	If it is, Boston could be designated a host community for the project under state law, giving the city broad power over the development, including the power to kill it.
Cause_Specific	Boston’s claim rests with the odd shape of the city line, which darts across the Mystic River into the edge of the former Monsanto chemical site where Wynn intends to build.
Cause_Specific	The state gambling commission brought the two sides together Wednesday to present their arguments at a public forum.
Main	After hearing both sides -- and seeing Wynn’s maps -- the panel gave the combatants until the end of the week to solve the dispute on their own, or the commission would solve it for them at a more formal hearing with witnesses, cross examinations, and documents entered into evidence.
Distant_Evaluation	Commission members did not directly say Wednesday which side they believed to be right, but suggested the documents provided by Wynn should help solve the dispute.
Distant_Evaluation	''It looks to me the facts are pretty clear,'' said commission chairman Stephen Crosby.
Cause_General	Wynn is competing for the sole Greater Boston casino Âlicense with Suffolk Downs, the East Boston casino proposal Âfavored by Menino, and a Foxwoods project in Milford.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The commission is expected to choose the winning applicant in early 2014.
Distant_Evaluation	Wynn’s representatives, including former governor William F. Weld, a partner at Mintz Levin, argued that the City of Boston, while not a host community, probably qualifies as a surrounding community under the law.
Distant_Evaluation	As a surrounding community, the city could negotiate with Wynn for compensation to address the effects of a casino, such as additional traffic on Boston streets.
Distant_Evaluation	Surrounding communities, however, do not hold binding public votes on casino projects, nor can they block a casino development by refusing to negotiate or by asking for too much.
Distant_Evaluation	Failed negotiations would be settled through arbitration.
Distant_Evaluation	''There is nothing personal here,'' Weld said.
Distant_Evaluation	''We want the City of Boston to receive fair compensation for any impacts.''
Cause_General	In presenting the city’s case, lawyers for Boston displayed Wynn’s own renderings of the project, which appear to show landscaping on a narrow triangle of land on the Boston side of the city line.
Cause_General	The city also claimed Wynn created confusion over Boston’s status by refusing to provide project plans and documents the city had requested.
Distant_Evaluation	Wynn’s representatives said artistic renderings should not be taken as formal plans.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lawyers representing the two sides swapped business cards after the hearing, which Crosby took as a positive sign they would be talking about a resolution, without further action from the commission.

Main	TEHRAN, Iran - On the eve of a visit by Iran’s moderate president to the United States, the Iranian authorities Wednesday unexpectedly freed 11 of Iran’s most prominent political prisoners, including Nasrin Sotoudeh, a human rights lawyer.
Distant_Evaluation	Analysts said the prisoner release was a significant step in Hasan Rouhani’s efforts to repair Iran’s relationship with the West, which has been mired in a dispute over Iran’s nuclear program and criticism of its human rights policies.
Cause_General	His visit to New York to attend the annual session of the U.N. General Assembly is part of a diplomatic offensive he began after his election in June.
Cause_General	Sotoudeh was serving six years in prison for endangering national security and misusing her profession as a lawyer.
Distant_Evaluation	In a telephone interview after her release, she said: “I don’t know why they released me.
Distant_Evaluation	I don’t know under what legal basis they released me.
Distant_Evaluation	But I am free.”
Distant_Evaluation	Her husband, Reza Khandan, said: “I just drove her home.
Distant_Evaluation	My wife is freed.”
Main	Of the prisoners freed Wednesday, eight are women and three are men.
Main	They include a journalist, Mahsa Amrabadi, whose husband and fellow journalist, Masoud Bastani, remains in prison.
Cause_General	Some of them were taking part in Iran’s prison leave system, in which some prisoners are allowed to live at home but remain under the threat of imprisonment if they cross the authorities.
Cause_General	But dozens of people remain in prison, especially those who have been sentenced for their roles in an anti-government protest after the disputed 2009 election results.
Cause_General	Rouhani is scheduled to speak Tuesday before the General Assembly, where is expected to portray an Iran ready to engage with the West.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Analysts said the prisoner release could soften some of the criticisms over Iran’s human rights policies and allow for Rouhani to focus on finding a diplomatic solution to the standoff over Iran’s disputed nuclear program.
Distant_Evaluation	“Clearly these releases are related to Mr. Rouhani’s trip to New York,” said Farshad Ghorbanpour, a political analyst close to the new president.
Distant_Evaluation	“Iran wants to make a good impression on the eve of his trip.”
Distant_Evaluation	The release of Sotoudeh, 50, is especially significant.
Cause_General	For a long time, she was the only lawyer in Iran taking on high-profile cases, defending children, activists and minorities.
Distant_Evaluation	Unlike some activists, Sotoudeh never chose to leave Iran, despite constant pressure on her by Iran’s intelligence services, which arrested her in 2010.
Distant_Historical	In addition to her jail sentence, she had been banned from practicing law for 20 years; it was unclear Wednesday whether the ban had been lifted.
Distant_Historical	In his annual message for Iranian New Year in 2011, President Barack Obama specifically singled out Sotoudeh.
Distant_Historical	“We have seen Nasrin Sotoudeh jailed for defending human rights,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	Iranian officials deny that there are any political prisoners in Iran, saying that all those behind bars have been tried according to the country’s laws.
Distant_Historical	While in Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, Sotoudeh went on two long hunger strikes after her 12-year-old daughter was denied permission to travel outside the country.
Distant_Historical	In 2012, the European Union awarded her the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought.
Main	Among the other prisoners released Wednesday was former Commerce Minister Feizollah Arabsorkhi, a member of a reformist political party declared illegal after the 2009 anti-government protests, which were triggered by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s disputed re-election victory.
Cause_General	Arabsorkhi was in a hospital in Tehran undergoing a shoulder operation when he heard that he had been officially freed, his wife, Maryam Sharbatqods, said over the phone.
Distant_Evaluation	“Rouhani’s election victory has forced the authorities to release the political prisoners,” Sharbatqods said.
Distant_Historical	Two presidential candidates in 2009 - former Prime Minister Mir Hussein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi, a former Parliament speaker - have been under house arrest since 2011, along with Mousavi’s wife, Zahra Rahnavard.
Distant_Historical	During his election campaign, Rouhani said he would work to secure their release.
Distant_Evaluation	Mehdi, 27, a university student who took part in the 2009 protests and asked that his surname not be published, said: “Today’s prisoner releases show that there are negotiations going on regarding their freedom.
Distant_Evaluation	Maybe it will take some time to get them freed from house arrest.
Distant_Evaluation	I am much more hopeful now.”
Cause_General	An imprisoned American of Iranian descent, Amir Hekmati, was not among those freed Wednesday.
Distant_Historical	Hekmati, 30, a former Marine, was arrested more than two years ago on espionage charges during what his family called an innocent visit to his grandmother.
Cause_General	Hekmati’s family, who is from Flint, Mich., has been publicly pleading for his release, and U.S. officials, including Secretary of State John Kerry, have been calling on Rouhani’s government to let Hekmati go home.
Cause_General	On Tuesday, Hekmati’s congressman, Rep. Daniel T. Kildee, sent a letter to Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, urging her to press the issue when Rouhani visits for the General Assembly session next week.
Error	Elisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome.
Main	Erich Priebke, a former SS captain who was sentenced to life in prison for helping to organize the execution of 335 men and boys at the Ardeatine Caves in Italy in 1944, died Friday under house arrest at his home in Rome.
Cause_General	He was 100 and the oldest surviving convicted Nazi war criminal.
Cause_Specific	He “died of old age,” said his lawyer, Paolo Giachini.
Distant_Historical	Priebke was at the center of one of the most contentious Nazi war-crimes prosecutions of the 1990s, begun after an American television crew tracked him down in Argentina at San Carlos de Bariloche, a resort city in the foothills of the Andes.
Distant_Historical	Priebke fled to South America soon after World War II and had been living under his real name, owning a butcher shop and traveling to Europe - and even Italy - with a German passport.
Distant_Historical	He was extradited to Italy in November 1995 and ordered to stand trial before an Italian military tribunal the next year.
Distant_Historical	The proceedings - described at the time as possibly the last Nazi war-crimes trial in Europe - centered on the massacre at the Ardeatine Caves, just south of Rome, on March 24, 1944.
Distant_Historical	The men and boys were rounded up and killed in reprisal for an attack in which Italian partisans killed 33 members of a Nazi security force.
Distant_Historical	Herbert Kappler, the Gestapo chief in Rome, ordered the deaths of 10 Italians for every dead policeman.
Distant_Historical	Seventy-five of the 335 victims were Jewish.
Distant_Historical	By many accounts, the captives were led into the caves with their hands tied behind their backs, forced to kneel - many over the bodies of those already killed - and shot in the neck.
Distant_Evaluation	Priebke said he was responsible for exceeding the quota by five.
Distant_Evaluation	“It went wrong,” he was quoted as saying in an article published in the German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung a week before his death.
Distant_Evaluation	The prosecution in Italy was a protracted affair.
Distant_Historical	The military tribunal that tried Priebke in 1996 ended up ordering him freed.
Distant_Historical	While finding him guilty of involvement in the massacre, the court acquitted him of acting with premeditation and cruelty.
Distant_Evaluation	Only a conviction on those counts would have sent him to prison because of a 30-year statute of limitations on murder charges.
Distant_Historical	His release caused an international outcry, and he was rearrested after an appellate court ordered another trial by military tribunal.
Distant_Historical	In July 1997, the second military court sentenced him to 15 years in prison, but reduced that term to five years, saying there had been mitigating factors, including Priebke’s assertion that he had acted under orders.
Distant_Historical	Prosecutors appealed, and in March 1998 Priebke was sentenced to life, a verdict that was upheld by the Court of Cassation, Italy’s highest appellate court.
Distant_Historical	Because of his age, Priebke was put under house arrest.
Cause_General	Two soldiers kept watch day and night outside the apartment block in western Rome where Priebke lived, and two police officers followed him whenever he left the residence, according to the account in Sueddeutsche Zeitung, by Malte Herwig.
Distant_Evaluation	Referring to Hannah Arendt’s famous phrase about the Nazis when she covered the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Israel, Herwig, who has done extensive research on the Nazi era, described his encounter with Priebke as “the last chance to investigate that supposed banality of evil with a living person.”
Distant_Historical	Priebke was born on July 29, 1913, in Hennigsdorf, near Berlin.
Distant_Historical	His parents both died early in his life, he told Herwig, and he was reared largely by an uncle.
Cause_General	Little is known of his early life.
Distant_Historical	As World War II ended, he was imprisoned by the British but eventually fled to a German-speaking area in the north of Italy, where he reunited with his wife and two sons, according to Herwig.
Distant_Historical	The family fled by way of Genoa to Argentina, where Priebke worked as a waiter and then opened a butcher shop.
Distant_Historical	His commander at the time of the massacre, Kappler, was sentenced to life in prison in 1948 by a Rome court.
Distant_Historical	He was smuggled out of a military hospital in 1997 and died in freedom in Germany the following year.
Distant_Historical	Karl Hass, an SS major, was convicted with Priebke in July 1997 and given a life sentence in 1998.
Distant_Historical	He died while under house arrest in 2004.
Cause_General	Priebke is survived by his two sons and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
Main_Consequence	His lawyer said he would be buried in Argentina.
Distant_Evaluation	In recent years, Priebke remained a rallying point both for neo-Nazis and their opponents.

Main	CAIRO - The judicial authorities in Egypt have ordered the release of former President Hosni Mubarak, who has been detained on a variety of charges since his ouster in 2011, according to state media and security officials Monday.
Distant_Evaluation	It remained possible, however, that the authorities would find other ways to keep him in detention.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The development threatened to inject a volatile new element into the standoff between the country’s military and Islamist supporters of the deposed President Mohammed Morsi as Egypt entered the sixth day of a state of emergency following a bloody crackdown by the military in which hundreds of people have been killed.
Distant_Evaluation	It was unclear how Egyptians would respond to the release of a despised autocrat whose downfall united Mubarak’s secular and Islamist foes.
Cause_General	Just in the past 24 hours, the Egyptian government has acknowledged that its security forces had killed 36 Islamists in its custody, while suspected militants were reported Monday to have killed at least 24 police officers in an attack on their minibuses in the restive northern Sinai region.
Cause_Specific	Mubarak, 85, faces an array of legal challenges including allegations of corruption and a retrial on charges of complicity in the murder of protesters whose revolt forced his ouster in February, 2011.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On Monday, Mubarak’s lawyer, Farid el-Deeb, said a court had ordered his release and he might be freed this week.
Cause_General	But there was no official confirmation from the military-backed interim government that Mubarak would be released.
Cause_General	News reports said that the ambush Monday occurred in a village near the town of Rafah and that three police officers had been wounded.
Cause_General	The attackers were initially depicted as Islamist militants firing rocket-propelled grenades at the police minibuses.
Cause_General	But there was some confusion, with later reports quoting officials who put the death toll at 25.
Cause_General	There was no official confirmation of the events.
Cause_General	Ambassadors from the 28-member European Union planned to meet Monday to review the bloc’s relationship with Egypt, confronting a question of whether stability and security outweigh considerations relating to human rights and democracy.
Distant_Evaluation	In a radio interview Monday, William Hague, the British foreign secretary, said he did not accept that outsiders were powerless to influence events.
Distant_Evaluation	“But we have to do our best to promote democratic institutions, to promote political dialogue and to keep faith with the majority of Egyptians who just want a free and stable and prosperous country,” he told the BBC.

Main	KIROV, Russia - Alexei A. Navalny, a lawyer who became Russia’s most resonant opposition voice by crusading against rampant public corruption, was found guilty Thursday of stealing money from a state-controlled timber company.
Main	He was sentenced to five years in prison - a punishment that immediately transformed Navalny, 37, who recently declared his candidacy for mayor of Moscow, from an opposition activist to a political dissident and prisoner.
Cause_General	Navalny - who became an irritant to President Vladimir Putin by branding his United Russia political machine as the “party of swindlers and thieves,” - was the first to use the Internet and social media as his main weapon against the state.
Cause_General	Navalny’s co-defendant, Pyotr Ofitserov, a businessman and acquaintance who worked with him on the timber project, was sentenced to four years in prison.
Cause_General	The two men, who had been accused of embezzling nearly $500,000, were also each fined more than $15,000.
Cause_Specific	Much of the judge’s findings was based on the testimony of a third man accused in the scheme, Vyacheslav Opalev, who pleaded guilty and worked with the prosecution.
Distant_Evaluation	In his decision, Judge Sergei Blinov called his testimony trustworthy and reliable.
Cause_Specific	But during the trial, Opalev at times gave contradictory evidence, and defense lawyers were not allowed to cross-examine him.
Cause_Specific	In addition, Blinov barred the defense from calling 13 witnesses.
Distant_Evaluation	The verdict quickly reverberated throughout the highest levels of Russian government and society and even sparked some calls for boycotts of the Moscow mayoral election and future national ballots.
Distant_Evaluation	Alexei L. Kudrin, a close associate of Putin and former finance minister, described it on Twitter as “looking less like a punishment than an attempt to isolate him from social life and the electoral process.”
Distant_Evaluation	The crime novelist Boris Akunin, who is also a political opposition leader, said the verdict showed there was little hope to change Russia by democratic means.
Distant_Evaluation	“Lifetime deprivation of elections - this is what the verdict means not only for Navalny but for all who thought it was possible to change this system through elections,” Akunin wrote.
Cause_General	As the five-year sentence was delivered, and the judge said that it could not be suspended but required actual jail time, some of Navalny’s supporters burst into tears.
Cause_General	He was led away in handcuffs.
Cause_General	In Moscow, even before the sentence was announced, supporters and the police began to gather at Manezh Square near the Kremlin where backers of Alexei Navalny had planned to hold an unsanctioned rally.
Cause_General	More than 7,000 people had responded to an announcement of the event on Facebook to say that they would attend.

Distant_Historical	HUNTSVILLE, Texas - Karl Eugene Chamberlain went to his neighbor’s apartment that night in Dallas under the pretense of borrowing sugar.
Distant_Historical	He returned later, forced her into a bedroom, bound her hands and feet, raped her and then used a rifle to shoot and kill her.
Distant_Historical	His victim, Felecia Prechtl, 29, was a single mother with a 5-year-old son.
Distant_Historical	Eleven years after he was convicted of capital murder, Chamberlain, 37, was strapped to a gurney in Texas’ execution chamber at the Walls Unit prison here and was asked by a warden if he had any last words.
Distant_Evaluation	“Thank you for being here today to honor Felecia Prechtl, whom I didn’t even know,” he told her son, parents and brother on June 11, 2008.
Distant_Evaluation	“I am so terribly sorry.
Distant_Evaluation	I wish I could die more than once to tell you how sorry I am.”
Cause_General	His words did not die with him.
Main	Texas wrote them down, kept them and posted them on the Internet.
Main	The state with the busiest death chamber in America publishes the final statements of the inmates it has executed on a prison agency website, a kind of public catalog of the rantings, apologies, prayers, claims of innocence and confessions of hundreds of men and women in the minutes before their deaths.
Cause_General	The condemned praised Allah and Jesus and Sant Ajaib Singh Ji, a Sikh master.
Distant_Historical	Three cheered for their favorite sports teams, including Jesse Hernandez, whose execution last year made headlines after he shouted, “Go Cowboys!”
Cause_General	The execution on Wednesday of Kimberly McCarthy - a 52-year-old woman convicted of robbing, beating and fatally stabbing a retired psychology professor near Dallas - was the 500th in Texas since December 1982, when the state resumed capital punishment after the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
Distant_Evaluation	The state’s execution record has often been criticized.
Distant_Evaluation	But three decades of last statements by inmates reveal a glimmer of the humanity behind those anonymous numbers.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s kind of mesmerizing to read through these,” said Robert Perkinson, the author of “Texas Tough: The Rise of America’s Prison Empire” and a professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
Distant_Evaluation	“Most people about to be executed haven’t had a lot of success in school or life.
Distant_Evaluation	They’re not always so skilled at articulating themselves.
Distant_Evaluation	There are plenty of clichés, sometimes peculiar ones, like the Cowboys reference.
Distant_Evaluation	But I think many of these individuals are also striving to say something poignant, worthy of the existential occasion.”
Main	SEOUL, South Korea - State prosecutors armed with metal detectors raided the Seoul residence of former President Chun Doo-hwan on Tuesday to look for assets of the ex-military dictator who owes South Korea 167.5 billion won ($150 million) in fines but claims to be broke.
Distant_Historical	In a Supreme Court ruling in 1997, Chun, now 82, was ordered to return to the state 220 billion won he illegally accumulated through bribery from big businesses during his eight and a half years in power in the 1980s.
Cause_General	He has so far paid only a quarter of the amount.
Distant_Historical	In his last payment, he handed in 3 million won he said he collected as a lecture fee.
Cause_General	Chun has rarely appeared in public since he stepped down in 1988 and entered a Buddhist monastery.
Distant_Historical	In the 1997 verdict, he was also convicted of sedition for his role in the 1979 military coup that brought him to power and a 1980 military crackdown that left hundreds of people dead in the southwestern city of Kwangju.
Distant_Historical	He initially was sentenced to death, a penalty that was reduced to a life imprisonment.
Distant_Historical	He was later pardoned and freed.
Main	On Tuesday, a team of 90 prosecutors, tax collectors and other investigators ransacked Chun’s home in eastern Seoul.
Cause_General	Television footage showed them hauling away paintings, porcelain and expensive artifacts.
Cause_General	The investigators also searched the properties owned by his eldest son, Chun Jae-kook.
Cause_General	The son’s publishing company, Sigongsa Inc., is one of the country’s largest and has published the Korean translations of books by John Grisham, C.?S.
Cause_General	Lewis and Roald Dahl.
Cause_General	Another son, Chun Jae-man, and his father-in-law run a California winery.
Cause_General	There was no immediate comment from Chun Doo-hwan’s family about the raids Tuesday.
Cause_General	Chun has been dogged by prosecutors for years.
Distant_Historical	In 2000, they seized a Mercedes-Benz sedan from him.
Distant_Historical	In 2003, they confiscated a refrigerator, television set and golf clubs and auctioned them off.
Distant_Historical	At the time, Chun claimed to have less than $260 in his bank accounts, although opposition lawmakers alleged that he may have had huge assets stashed away.
Cause_Specific	Suspicion resurfaced after Newstapa, a website run by the Korea Center of Investigative Journalism, recently reported that Chun Jae-kook set up a shell company in the British Virgin Islands in 2004.
Distant_Evaluation	The son has since said that the account had nothing to do with his father.
Cause_Specific	Last month, the National Assembly passed a bill extending the statute of limitations on confiscating assets from public officials who have failed to pay fines.
Cause_Specific	Under the old law, prosecutors had only until October.
Cause_Specific	The new law extended the statute of limitations on Chun Doo-hwan’s case until 2020 and allowed prosecutors to collect from his family members as well if they could prove that any of their properties originated from Chun’s illegal funds.
Cause_Specific	The military coup in 1979 propelled Chun, an army major general at the time, into the power vacuum created by the assassination of President Park Chung-hee, the father of the current president, Park Geun-hye.
Cause_General	During her presidential campaign, Park admitted that she had received 600 million won from Chun after the coup.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	She said she would repay the money to the state.
Distant_Historical	Former President Roh Tae-woo, a fellow army general and friend of Chun who replaced him as president, was also ordered to pay back 260 billion won.
Cause_General	Roh has more than 90 percent of the sum.
Main	NEW YORK - Joseph J. Lhota, making his first campaign appearances since winning the Republican nomination for mayor, on Thursday criticized his likely Democratic opponent, Bill de Blasio, accusing him of trying to divide the city by class in order to score votes.
Cause_General	Lhota, in a series of interviews, portrayed de Blasio as a free-spending liberal who wants to raise taxes, and who would seek to undo the progress made by the current mayor, Michael Bloomberg, and his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
Distant_Evaluation	“His approach to things is to tear things down and build them up in the image that he wants, which I think is a failed image,” Lhota said in a television interview.
Distant_Evaluation	He said de Blasio’s approach amounted to “a repudiation of everything great that’s happened over the last 20 years, and we can’t let that happen.”
Distant_Evaluation	The media tour by Lhota marked the beginning of an effort by the candidate to appeal to a wide audience of voters, after months in which he focused on drumming up support among the Republicans whose support he needed in Tuesday’s primary.
Cause_General	His remarks came as the Democratic race remained unsettled, with de Blasio hovering slightly above the 40 percent threshold required to avoid a runoff, but thousands of paper ballots still to count.
Cause_General	De Blasio, trying to create an air of inevitability about his nomination, held a rally in Brooklyn with supporters, many of whom had earlier endorsed his rivals.
Cause_General	In Lhota’s appearances, which also included radio interviews, he acknowledged that the Democratic primary was still unresolved, but he spoke as if de Blasio were his opponent.
Main	He mounted a direct attack on de Blasio’s “tale of two cities” campaign theme, saying that de Blasio was trying to “separate classes” as a political strategy.
Main	“Calling it a tale of two cities, that level of invective has no place in any campaign, at all,” Lhota said.
Main	“It divides people.
Main	What we really need to do is to work together and provide a solution, not separating people and then saying that the ends justify the means.”
Distant_Evaluation	He also criticized the policy centerpiece of de Blasio’s campaign, a proposal to raise taxes on high earners to pay for expanded prekindergarten and after-school programs.
Distant_Evaluation	Lhota said that de Blasio’s “knee-jerk response to any new program is to raise taxes,” an approach he said was “instinctively wrong.” Instead, Lhota said the mayor should look to find efficiencies in the city’s budget.
Cause_General	Lhota also visited the Queens burial site of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who was the revered leader of Lubavitch Hasidim.
Cause_General	Around 9 a.m., Lhota entered Ohel Chabad-Lubavitch, a ramshackle building next to the burial site.
Cause_General	Flanked by rabbis, one of whom addressed him as Mayor, Lhota asked for, and received, a gift of honey cake, following a Jewish tradition associated with the Lubavitcher rebbe, as Schneerson was known.
Cause_General	Lhota brought a note to the rebbe’s grave site, tore it and cast it onto a pile of other torn notes, in accordance with another Jewish custom.
Distant_Evaluation	He said a prayer at the site; in an interview, he declined to say what the prayer was, only that it was a prayer for all New Yorkers.
Cause_Specific	NEW YORK - When Joseph C. Massino took the witness stand in 2011, becoming the first official boss of one of New York’s five crime families to break the code of silence and testify against a former confederate, he offered a succinct explanation for his departure from mob tradition.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I’m hoping to see a light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
Main	On Wednesday, the tunnel got a whole lot shorter: A federal judge commuted Massino’s sentence of two consecutive life terms in prison.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Massino, the former boss of the Bonanno crime family, will be released from federal custody in 60 days, a period the government requested to put in place security arrangements to keep Massino safe from what are presumed to be a considerable number of enemies.
Cause_Specific	Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn had sought a reduction of Massino’s sentence, citing his extensive cooperation: While incarcerated, Massino had recorded conversations with a Mafia captain, and he has provided investigators with information about hundreds of people associated with not only the Bonanno family, which Massino took control of in 1991, but also the other crime families across New York.
Main	At a brief hearing in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on Wednesday, Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis credited the government’s arguments and decided to undo the sentence of two life terms that he had originally meted out to Massino.
Distant_Historical	When that sentence was handed down, in 2005, clapping could be heard in his courtroom.
Distant_Evaluation	But on Wednesday, the judge said that in deciding to free Massino after more than 10 years of incarceration, he had considered the aging mobster’s “extraordinary cooperation with the government and his willingness to place himself at grave personal risk.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Once released, Massino will probably receive a new identity and live elsewhere in the United States, his lawyer, Edward A. McDonald, said after the hearing.
Distant_Evaluation	McDonald said that Massino could support himself on rental income from his property and that he was also eligible for Social Security income.
Distant_Evaluation	Garaufis said that Massino, a rotund man of 70 whose health is failing, “may be the most important cooperator in the modern history of law enforcement efforts to prosecute the American Mafia.” He said that Massino’s assistance was essential in the investigations of the four leaders of the Bonanno family who followed him.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The judge also noted that Massino’s willingness to turn informer “has almost certainly caused numerous other members of organized crime to cooperate with the government.”
Cause_General	Massino’s own crimes received only passing mention on Wednesday.
Cause_Specific	He has been convicted of eight murders, including those of several rivals in the Bonanno family.
Cause_General	Massino, who wore a two-toned sweatsuit, said little during the hearing, leaving most of the speaking to his lawyer.
Cause_General	But Massino did offer a brief statement of remorse, which he delivered standing in a single breath, and then quickly sat down.
Distant_Evaluation	“I pray every night for forgiveness of everyone I hurt, especially the victims’ families,” he said.
Cause_General	A prosecutor, Taryn A. Merkl, said that the government had reached out to the families of Massino’s victims to inquire if any wanted to make a statement in court, but had not received any responses.
Distant_Evaluation	Merkl said that nothing about the government’s decision to take Massino’s side “apologizes or condones the life he led, yet at the same time he decided to make a change.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Details of the life Massino will lead after his release were scarce.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Garaufis directed Massino to continue to cooperate with the government, noting that prosecutors had informed him that Massino was helping with a number of investigations that were still pending.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Garaufis said Massino’s age and ill health reduced “the court’s concern about possible recidivism.” Nonetheless, he ordered that Massino not associate “for the rest of your life” with known organized crime figures.
Distant_Evaluation	McDonald would not comment on the nature of his client’s health ailments, except to say that Massino often said he “had everything except cancer.”
Distant_Evaluation	McDonald described his client as “a stoic guy,” but said Massino often told him that “if he had to make the decision again, if he was 18 or 19 years old, he wouldn’t go into the Mafia.”

Main	BEIJING – China’s most celebrated film director, Zhang Yimou, is being investigated for a potential violation of family planning laws, an official said Thursday, confirming reports in state news media.
Main	Family planning officials are examining discussions on the Internet that say Zhang has fathered up to seven children with four women.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If he is found to have violated the laws, he could be fined nearly $27 million because the fines are based on the offender’s income, according to a report in the online edition of People’s Daily, the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party.
Cause_General	An official in a propaganda office attached to the family planning committee of Jiangsu province, near Shanghai on the east coast, confirmed the substance of the People’s Daily report, which was published Wednesday.
Cause_General	Calls to the family planning committee of Wuxi, the city where Chen Ting, Zhang’s second wife, is registered as a resident, went unanswered Thursday.
Cause_General	Family planning laws generally restrict families to one child, and fines are levied for additional children.
Cause_General	There are numerous exceptions, though: Many rural families and ethnic minorities are allowed to have more than one child without penalty.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Xinhua, the state news agency, said Thursday that the local family planning committee would release the results of its investigation into Zhang soon.
Distant_Historical	Zhang’s most recent feature film was “The Flowers of War” starring Christian Bale; China entered it into the Oscar contest for best foreign film of 2011.
Distant_Historical	Early in his career, Zhang made a string of films that became popular on the international film festival circuit and in foreign art theaters, including “Red Sorghum,” “Raise the Red Lantern” and “To Live,” adaptations of well-known literary works.
Distant_Historical	He achieved commercial success with “Hero,” a martial arts film, and was commissioned by Communist Party leaders to direct the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.
Cause_General	Zhang, 61, is a member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, a sort of honorary legislature whose seats are often distributed by the party as political rewards.
Distant_Evaluation	Zhang’s critics say he has changed over the years from a director with an uncompromising vision to one who bows to the whims of party officials.
Distant_Evaluation	In an interview in Beijing with The New York Times published in 2012, Zhang said censorship “can’t be changed, and it will be there in the future.” He added: “Foreigners think that because I did the opening ceremony of the Olympics, I have certain privileges, but in fact it’s not like that at all.
Distant_Evaluation	In front of censorship, everyone is equal.”
Cause_General	Zhang could not be reached for comment Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	There has been a recent push by scholars to end the one-child policy, which critics say has led to forced abortions and sterilizations.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some economists say that China will face a dwindling pool of young workers in the coming years, and that it no longer makes sense to continue the policy.
Distant_Evaluation	Furthermore, for economic reasons, the birthrate is falling across China, especially in urban areas.
Cause_General	There is no reliable public report that gives the exact number of children Zhang has with Chen, an actress.
Cause_Specific	The recent surge of interest among Chinese Internet users in Zhang’s children appeared to have begun Monday, when Southern Entertainment Weekly published an article that said the couple had two sons and a daughter.
Cause_General	That assertion has not been independently confirmed and the article did not name the sources of the information.
Cause_Specific	The reporter and a photographer camped outside Zhang’s many homes in Beijing, and the photographer followed a car of his to the airport and witnessed what appeared to be some family members emerging from the car, the article said.
Cause_General	Zhang has a daughter with his first wife, Xiao Hua, whom he divorced around the time he was in a relationship with Gong Li, who starred in Zhang’s early films and became China’s best-known actress.
Cause_General	The daughter, Zhang Mo, is about 30 and studied filmmaking at New York University.
Cause_General	She has worked as a film editor for her father and was a translator for Bale on the set of “The Flowers of War.”
Cause_General	The People’s Daily report said there was speculation that Zhang may have three other children with two other women, but it did not give their identities.
Main	ROME - A visibly shaken Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister, said Sunday that his center-right party would continue to support Italy’s fragile coalition government, releasing some of the political tension that has built in the country since a court upheld his conviction for tax fraud last week.
Distant_Evaluation	“We have said clearly and directly that the government must forge ahead and approve the economic measures that we have requested and were agreed,” Berlusconi said in his first public appearance since the conviction, speaking at a rally his party had organized in front of his residence here.
Distant_Anecdotal	Italy’s prime minister, Enrico Letta, watched the rally on television and took note of Berlusconi’s intentions.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But he made clear that he expected concrete action, like support for a package of economic measures that are scheduled to be voted on in Parliament next week, a member of Letta’s staff said.
Distant_Evaluation	“I can promise you,” Berlusconi told his supporters, almost in tears.
Distant_Evaluation	“Here I am.
Distant_Evaluation	I am staying here.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	I won’t surrender.”
Cause_General	An estimated 2,000 people attended the rally to express anger and bewilderment at the ruling.
Distant_Evaluation	“This party carries 10 million votes,” Raffaele Fitto, a former government minister from Berlusconi’s People of Liberty party, told the television network La7 from the rally.
Distant_Evaluation	“It cannot be canceled with a pen stroke.”
Cause_Specific	Last week, Italy’s highest court upheld a four-year prison sentence for Berlusconi, which had been effectively reduced to one year, for tax fraud.
Cause_Specific	He was found guilty of a plot in which his Mediaset broadcasting company bought the rights to show U.S. movies on their networks and inflated the prices, using offshore companies to evade taxes.
Distant_Evaluation	After the ruling, lawmakers from the People of Liberty party offered to resign and have been demanding that President Giorgio Napolitano pardon Berlusconi, but experts say that is highly unlikely.
Cause_General	By Oct. 15, Berlusconi must decide whether he prefers to serve his time in jail, under house arrest or do community service.

Distant_Evaluation	BEIJING - In a city brimming with look-at-me architecture, the sprawling addition that Zhang Biqing, a health care magnate, built atop his 26th-floor apartment is a showstopper.
Distant_Evaluation	Constructed with ersatz boulders, crisscrossed by trellises and walkways and dotted with the occasional shrub, the two-story aerie resembles the idealized mountains depicted in classical Chinese paintings - except the requisite lonely monk of yore has been replaced by a flashy karaoke parlor.
Cause_Specific	The entire 8,000-square-foot addition, as it turns out, is illegal.
Cause_General	On Monday, The Beijing Morning News featured a front-page photograph of Zhang’s garish rooftop expansion, along with disturbing accounts of how the well-connected entrepreneur blithely ignored his neighbors’ complaints during the six years he spent creating his craggy villa atop a luxury gated complex in western Beijing.
Distant_Anecdotal	Tenants were so tortured by the din of nonstop construction - and the resulting leaks and cracked walls - that several of them sold their apartments and moved out.
Distant_Anecdotal	One next-door neighbor was reportedly beaten up after he confronted Zhang about the project, which is said to have cost more than $4 million.
Distant_Evaluation	The story, zealously covered by much of the Chinese news media on Tuesday, seemed to embody the popular perception that the rich and powerful can simply do as they please.
Cause_General	According to news reports, Zhang amassed a fortune through a chain of traditional Chinese medicine clinics he owned, or through private acupuncture sessions.
Cause_General	Until recently, he was a local delegate to the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body to the ruling Communist Party.
Cause_Specific	Code enforcement officials said they were stymied by Zhang’s refusal to let them into his apartment.
Cause_Specific	The deputy head of the Purple Bamboo Park urban management district said he even dispatched inspectors to the building’s underground parking garage but Zhang managed to evade them.
Distant_Evaluation	“If we can’t calculate the scope of this illegal construction, we can’t issue a notice requiring him to dismantle it,” the official told the paper.
Distant_Evaluation	By Tuesday, however, Zhang appeared to run out of luck.
Main	Officials slapped a notice on his front door, giving him 15 days to remove the addition or present evidence that it had been legally constructed.
Distant_Evaluation	He claimed the structure was safe in a brief interview Tuesday evening, but conceded that it might have been a folly after all.
Distant_Evaluation	“Now I realize it was a huge mistake,” he said, adding that he would dismantle the addition within a week.
Main	OTTAWA - Loblaw Cos. Ltd., Canada’s largest grocer, said Monday that it would acquire Shoppers Drug Mart, the country’s biggest pharmacy chain, for $11.9 billion in cash and stock.
Cause_Specific	Family-owned Loblaw is facing several challenges to its core business.
Cause_General	Last month, Sobeys, another family-owned grocery store chain, acquired the Canadian stores of Safeway for $5.8 billion in cash.
Cause_Specific	Target is opening its first Canadian stores, many of which include extensive grocery sections.
Cause_Specific	And Wal-Mart Canada has been enlarging food departments at many of its stores.
Main	Loblaw will exchange the equivalent of 33.18 Canadian dollars in cash and 0.5965 of a common share for each Shoppers Drug Mart share.
Cause_General	The grocery chain said the combined value was 61.54 Canadian dollars, or $59.05, a 29.4 percent premium to the average share price of the drug chain over the last 20 days.
Cause_General	The deal is the largest transaction between two Canadian companies since 2009, when Suncor Energy bought Petro-Canada for $15 billion.
Cause_General	Under the current plan, Shoppers Drug Mart shareholders can choose either 61.54 Canadian dollars in cash or 1.29417 Loblaw shares plus one Canadian cent for each of their shares.
Cause_General	Shoppers Drug Mart shareholders would own 29 percent of the combined company.
Distant_Evaluation	In a news conference, Galen G. Weston, executive chairman of Loblaw, said that while the two companies had spoken informally over the years, he proposed the transaction to Holger Kluge, the chairman of Shoppers, during a meeting “in a minivan on a country road on Thursday morning.” The unusual venue appears to be the result of Kluge’s attending an out-of-office meeting.
Distant_Evaluation	Weston said repeatedly that the transaction was part of a “vision that combined health, wellness and nutrition” for the company.
Distant_Evaluation	Loblaw, which has long been associated with high-margin, high-quality house brand merchandise, has been promoting a line of products it says are more healthful and posting extensive nutritional information in stores.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Loblaw said it planned to use its distribution network and grocery-buying power to improve the food sections at Shoppers stores, which have been greatly expanded in recent years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Those sections will eventually start carrying Loblaw’s “President’s Choice” house brand line of products as well as more fresh food.
Cause_General	Domenic Pilla, president and chief executive of Shoppers, will manage the pharmacy as a separate unit that will continue to operate under its own brand names, which include Pharmaprix in Quebec.
Cause_General	The combined company would have revenue of 42 billion Canadian dollars.
Distant_Evaluation	Loblaw’s executives played down potential antitrust concerns, saying their company controls about 5 percent of the Canadian pharmacy business while Shoppers holds 25 percent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But David Soberman, a professor of marketing at the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, said there might be problems because the national figures did not reflect the outsized market share of both companies in Ontario, the county’s most populous province.
Main	Transocean shareholders Friday ousted board chairman J. Michael Talbert and installed one of billionaire investor Carl Icahn’s nominees as a director, but they rejected Icahn’s proposal for a $4-per-share dividend as too risky at a time when the company still faces financial uncertainties from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Cause_General	According to vote totals announced at the company’s annual meeting in Zug, Switzerland, shareholders chose by a big margin to go with the company’s $2.24-a-share dividend proposal.
Cause_General	It will be payable in four quarterly installments, set for June, September and December of this year and March of 2014.
Cause_General	In the vote for directors, shareholders chose Icahn nominee Samuel Merksamer and rejected Talbert, who said this week he would step down before next year’s meeting if he was re-elected.
Cause_General	Shareholders approved the rest of the company’s director nominees, rejecting Icahn candidates Jose Maria Alapont and John Lipinski.
Distant_Evaluation	CEO Steven Newman said in a telephone interview that the shareholders’ decisions were largely a victory for the company and its goals, and that the dividend vote in particular was ''an overwhelming endorsement.''
Cause_General	He noted that more than 75 percent of shares voted favored the company’s proposal.
Distant_Evaluation	And he praised the departing board chairman, who also served formerly as CEO.
Distant_Evaluation	''He has been instrumental in shepherding this company through growth, through an unprecedented industrial crisis and more recently helping the board and the management teams focus on the right priorities,'' Newman said.
Distant_Evaluation	The defeat on the dividend proposal was a big loss for Icahn, who disclosed earlier this year that he had bought a large block of Transocean shares and would pursue change aggressively at the world’s largest offshore drilling contractor.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But with one of his nominees on the board, he could increase his influence in company decisions in the future.
Cause_General	Prior to the vote, Icahn had cited the company’s poor stock performance.
Cause_General	Its share price has dropped by more than a third since the day before an undersea well blew out in 2010 and triggered an explosion on the Transocean-owned Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico that killed 11 workers.
Distant_Historical	The resulting oil spill was the worst offshore spill in U.S. history.
Cause_General	Transocean shares closed Friday down 70 cents at $54.03 in New York trading.
Cause_General	Icahn had proposed that shareholders oust directors Talbert, Robert Sprague and Thomas Cason, replacing them with Alapont, former CEO of Federal-Mogul Corp., Merksamer, managing director at Icahn Capital, and Lipinski, CEO and president of CVR Energy.
Cause_General	Shareholders concurred only in voting out Talbert and electing Merksamer.
Distant_Evaluation	In a statement after the votes were announced, Icahn said he was pleased with the support Merksamer received from shareholders.
Distant_Evaluation	He said he believes shareholders ''sent an unequivocal and vocal message to the incumbent directors and management, by voting out the chairman, that immediate discipline must be brought to all fiscal and capital allocation decisions.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He added, ''We expect that the newly constituted board will take prompt action to deliver that sorely needed change.''
Cause_General	His statement made no mention of the dividend defeat.
Cause_General	The board’s governance committee will lead the process of selecting a new chairman, but the company did not detail plans for that Friday or give a timetable.
Error	optional
Cause_General	Talbert had been a long-time board member of Transocean and former CEO of the company.
Cause_General	Sprague is an engineer by education who served for years as an executive at Royal Dutch Shell before retiring from the company.
Cause_General	Cason owns and manages equipment dealership related to the agricultural industry and is a former chief financial officer at oil field services firm Baker Hughes.
Cause_General	Also at the meeting, Newman was re-elected to the board for a three-year term and company nominee Frederico Curado, who is chief of Brazilian aircraft maker Embraer S.A., was elected to join the board for a three-year term.
Cause_General	Other business on the agenda for the meeting included the re-adoption of the company’s authorized share capital for another two years.
Cause_General	The proposal was rejected because it did not receive enough votes in favor, according to a company statement.
Error	end optional
Distant_Evaluation	Newman said a silver lining of the proxy contest is that it increased shareholder engagement.
Distant_Evaluation	Now, he said, it’s back to work.
Distant_Evaluation	Transocean has to continue to build on its assets, create shareholder value and remove uncertainties clouding the company, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''I think everybody wants the stock price to continue to improve,'' Newman said.
Distant_Evaluation	One of the big uncertainties is the still-pending litigation in federal court in New Orleans over the Gulf oil spill.

Main	NEW YORK - The principal of Stuyvesant High School, one of the city’s top public schools, mishandled the investigation into a large cheating operation there last year from the moment he was tipped off to it until state education officials became aware of it more than a week later, a city report issued Friday said.
Cause_Specific	The principal, Stanley Teitel, retired last summer while the city’s Education Department was investigating his handling of the cheating, which involved more than 60 students using smartphones to receive answers for standardized city and state tests.
Cause_Specific	The report, issued by the Education Department’s Office of Special Investigations, said that after Teitel was tipped off by a student about the cheating, he set up a sting operation to catch the ringleader when he should have tried to pre-emptively thwart the cheating, including by enforcing the citywide ban on phones inside schools.
Cause_Specific	The report said that Teitel and an assistant principal, Randi Damesek, took too long to question students involved and did not report the cheating to state officials until eight days after catching the lead student, when reporters began inquiring about what had happened.
Main	“It is the conclusion of this office that due to a lack of foresight, candor and professional judgment, Teitel and Damesek failed to efficiently and effectively carry out the administrative duties entrusted to them during their handling of the 'cheating incident,' of June 2012,” the report said.
Main_Consequence	It recommended that Teitel be barred from future employment in city schools, and the Education Department will follow that recommendation, Erin Hughes, a spokeswoman, said.
Distant_Evaluation	Teitel said Friday he had not seen the report and would not discuss its contents.
Distant_Evaluation	“No one sent me a copy of it,” he said, adding, “I am retired.
Distant_Evaluation	I have been retired for over a year.”
Cause_General	Efforts to reach Damesek were unsuccessful.
Main_Consequence	The Education Department will bring disciplinary charges against her and seek her firing “or, at the very minimum, a demotion,” Hughes said.
Cause_General	Besides its unflattering portrait of the leadership team at one of the most prestigious high schools in the country, the report also describes a 21st-century example of how students let others peek at their answers.
Cause_Specific	The ringleader, Nayeem Ahsan, referred to as “Student A” in the report, told investigators he used his iPhone to send answers to other students via text messages to “garner good will” among classmates, the report said, and perhaps get help from them in subjects he was weaker in.
Cause_Specific	The number of students involved who received his texts “grew and grew,” according to Ahsan’s account in the report.
Cause_Specific	During the physics Regents exam, he told investigators, he waited until one proctor left the room and was replaced by a lax one who did not walk around.
Cause_Specific	Eventually, she fell asleep, he said, and he began sending out answers.
Cause_Specific	The proctor denied falling asleep.
Cause_Specific	On June 16, a student emailed Teitel to say that Ahsan had “electronically assisted” several students on Regents exams and was set to do so again, the report said.
Distant_Evaluation	In reaction to that message, Teitel “showed an extreme lack of judgment,” it said.
Cause_Specific	He set up a sting operation for a June 18 language exam, placing a reliable proctor to catch Ahsan in the act, the report said.
Cause_Specific	When the proctor did so, he notified Teitel, who took Ahsan and his phone out of the room.
Cause_Specific	School staff members copied information from the phone to find out who else had been receiving answers.
Cause_Specific	Shortly after Ahsan left, the information on his phone suddenly disappeared; he told school staff members that he had just suspended his phone service, which they did not believe, the report said.
Cause_Specific	Teitel told Ahsan and his father, “There’s no way I’m keeping him” at Stuyvesant and told them to request a safety-related transfer to another school, which they reluctantly did, but education officials rejected it, saying his safety was not in jeopardy.
Cause_Specific	Dozens of students were suspended for several days and had to retake exams.
Cause_General	Nayeem spent his senior year at Forest Hills High School in Queens and graduated two months ago, according to his father.
Distant_Evaluation	Although the report is dated Nov. 5, its release was delayed until Friday, “because there were allegations of a 'culture of cheating,'” at Stuyvesant, Hughes said.
Distant_Evaluation	“We kept the investigation open and monitored until the end of the school year,” Hughes said.
Distant_Evaluation	“No further evidence was presented that warranted a change in the report, so the report was issued as is.”
Main	PARIS - Czech prosecutors asked the Parliament on Monday to strip former Prime Minister Petr Necas of immunity from prosecution.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Law enforcement officials said the request was a prelude to charging Necas with corruption.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Necas would be the highest-level official to face corruption charges in the country since the fall of communism.
Cause_General	A bookish, churchgoing father of four, Necas came to power in 2010 promising to clean up a culture of cronyism and corruption, but he was forced to resign last month after his chief of staff was charged with bribery and abuse of office.
Cause_General	The chief of staff - Jana Nagyova, a close confidante of Necas - is accused of ordering the secret services to spy on Necas’ estranged wife, whom he is divorcing.
Cause_General	Nagyova has also been charged with offering bribes in the form of posts at state-owned companies to three members of Parliament who opposed a government austerity plan.
Cause_Specific	Prosecutors said they were examining whether Necas had links to the bribery scheme, which some analysts and supporters of Necas have dismissed as the routine trading of political favors rather than a criminal act.
Distant_Evaluation	Necas said Monday that no agreement had been made with the three lawmakers, and that, in any case, political agreements could not be considered crimes.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is not clear to me what I should be charged with,” he said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“So far, all the information we have shows that this whole case is about criminalizing political decisions.
Distant_Evaluation	I refuse this approach.
Distant_Evaluation	I find it unacceptable and I shall not accept it.
Distant_Evaluation	I am ready to defend myself.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Jindrich Sidlo, a commentator for Hospodarske Noviny, a leading economic newspaper, said on Monday that going ahead with charges in the case would turn Czech politics upside down.
Distant_Evaluation	“If this political deal is bribery, then this would be the end of politics in the Czech Republic as we have known it for the past 20 years,” he said by telephone from Prague.
Distant_Evaluation	But Ivo Istvan, the chief prosecutor in the case, said that using a state job to entice a lawmaker to resign did constitute bribery, no different than offering a briefcase full of money.
Distant_Evaluation	“If a member of Parliament does not act in the public interest in order to be awarded a state job, we can speak about political corruption,” Istvan said.
Distant_Evaluation	“We need to ask if Parliament is a place where parliamentarians vote according to their conscience or according to what it can buy them.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The parliamentary committee that deals with immunity is scheduled to discuss the case July 17, with a vote by the full Parliament expected to take place in September.
Distant_Evaluation	Analysts said it was difficult to predict the outcome.
Cause_General	President Milos Zeman has appointed Jiri Rusnok, a leftist former finance minister, to replace Necas.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Zeman is expected to approve Rusnok’s Cabinet on Wednesday, with a vote of confidence in Parliament to follow within 30 days.

Main	SAN DIEGO - Mayor Bob Filner resigned Friday under a barrage of sexual harassment complaints, offering an apology to his accusers while still denying the allegations and blaming his downfall on “a combination of awkwardness and hubris.”
Distant_Evaluation	“I never intended to be a mayor who went out like this,” Filner said before a packed City Council chamber, drawing sporadic applause from some supporters in the audience.
Cause_Specific	His announcement came after a closed-door meeting of the City Council in which members considered a deal struck late Wednesday that paved the way for the mayor’s resignation.
Cause_General	He is to step down Aug. 30.
Distant_Evaluation	“This is the toughest decision in my life,” said Filner, who devoted many of his comments to criticizing his political enemies and speaking of the vision he had for leading the city.
Cause_Specific	The council’s decision came after dozens of people packed the chambers to voice their opinion on a deal whose details they had no way of knowing.
Cause_General	Several residents supporting a recall effort urged council members to reject any deal that would give Filner money for his legal fees and damages.
Cause_General	But others sought compassion for Filner, citing his years of championing civil rights and the environment.
Distant_Evaluation	The resignation capped a tumultuous six weeks for San Diego.
Cause_Specific	Since Filner’s top communication aide first went public with her complaints of sexual harassment last month, 17 more women came forward with accusations against him.
Cause_General	The women who said they were harassed included a retired Navy rear admiral, a great-grandmother, a university dean and the former communications director, Irene McCormack Jackson, who filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the mayor and the city.
Distant_Evaluation	Filner eventually apologized for what he called disrespectful behavior, but maintained that he had not broken any laws and that he wanted an impartial review of his actions to clear his name.
Cause_General	His lawyers filed papers in court to move the lawsuit against him to Imperial County, just east of San Diego.
Cause_General	But calls for his resignation grew louder in recent weeks and organizers on Sunday started collecting signatures to force a recall election against him.
Cause_General	Organizers of the recall effort said Friday that they had more than 20,000 signatures, about one-fifth of what would be needed to qualify for the ballot.
Main_Consequence	Todd Gloria, the Democratic City Council president, who was part of the negotiations, will serve as acting mayor until a special election is held in the next 90 days.

Main	Random House and Penguin completed their planned merger Monday, creating the biggest and most powerful book publisher in the world.
Main_Consequence	The new company, called Penguin Random House, will control more than 25 percent of the U.S. trade book market, giving it unmatched leverage against Amazon.com, a growing force in the industry.
Distant_Historical	Bertelsmann, the owner of Random House, and Pearson, the owner of Penguin, announced the merger in October, saying that Bertelsmann would control 53 percent of the company and Penguin 47 percent.
Cause_Specific	Since then, the merger has sailed through regulatory approvals in the United States and Europe, as well as China, Canada and other countries.
Main_Consequence	The new company would have more than 10,000 employees, 250 independent publishing imprints and about $3.9 billion in annual revenues.
Cause_General	Markus Dohle, the chairman and chief executive of Random House who will take on the role of chief executive of the new company, announced the finalization of the merger in an email to employees Monday.
Main	“Today, we are Penguin Random House,” he wrote.
Distant_Evaluation	“You should be proud of what you’ve accomplished and what we are all now a part of: the first truly global trade book publishing company.
Distant_Evaluation	Together, we are even better positioned to fulfill our core purpose: to bridge authors and readers by publishing the very best books.”
Distant_Historical	Bertelsmann acquired Random House in 1998 for more than $1 billion.
Main_Consequence	David Shanks, the chief executive of Penguin Group USA, has stepped down and will be a senior adviser to Dohle and the executive team, Dohle said in his letter to employees.
Main_Consequence	John Makinson, the head of Penguin Group since 2002, will be the chairman of Penguin Random House.
Distant_Evaluation	“Penguin Random House starts life today as a freshly minted company, but also as a creative enterprise that will draw on the greatest legacies in the history of book publishing,” Makinson said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	Over the last several months, executives at both companies have sought to assure employees on the publishing side that it will be business as usual.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There are no immediate plans for laying off employees or shuttering imprints.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Executives at Penguin and Random House said the initial focus would be on unifying the infrastructure of the companies, including establishing pay scales, health benefits and new email addresses.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There will also be an effort to sort out redundancies.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As physical book sales decrease, so does the need for gigantic warehouses to store and ship books; the newly combined company is likely to find ways to trim printing, distribution and storage costs.
Main	The law firms Orrick Herrington & Sutcliffe and Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman are in advanced merger talks, with an announcement of a deal expected as early as next week.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A combination would create one of the country’s 10 largest firms with about 1,700 lawyers.
Cause_General	The discussions underscore the pressure on corporate law firms to grow their businesses amid persistently soft demand for legal services and the increasing globalization of the corporate law industry.
Main	“Our firms are in exploratory discussions about a possible combination,” James Rishwain, the chairman of Pillsbury, and Mitch Zuklie, the chairman of Orrick, said in a joint statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“These talks are serving to confirm the great respect our firms have for each other.”
Distant_Evaluation	People close to the talks said that the deal could still fall apart but that they were far along.
Cause_General	Typically, the executive committees of each firm agree to the main terms of a merger and then the entire partnerships vote at a later date.
Cause_General	The news was first reported by Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	Mergers among the nation’s 100 largest firms once occurred infrequently, and marriages involving top firms were rarer still.
Cause_General	But today, firms are under pressure to add to their practices quickly to break into new geographic markets and practice areas.
Distant_Evaluation	And some legal industry studies have concluded that size matters in corporate law - the larger the firm, the stronger the brand.
Distant_Evaluation	Law firm mergers are booming, and a combination of Orrick and Pillsbury would be the year’s largest.
Cause_General	Fifty-eight law firms had announced mergers as of the end of September, a 41 percent increase from the same period last year, according to survey by Altman Weil, a legal industry consulting firm.
Distant_Historical	In 2012, the large Houston firm, Fulbright & Jaworksi, joined forces with Norton Rose in Britain, creating a firm of nearly 4,000 lawyers.
Cause_General	Dentons, a firm of about 2,500 lawyers, is in talks to acquire McKenna Long & Aldridge in a deal that would push its lawyer count to more than 3,000.
Distant_Evaluation	But law firm mergers carry significant risk.
Distant_Evaluation	For starters, there is a possibility that the leaking of merger talks can have a destabilizing effect on the firms involved, leading to defections by important partners who may disapprove of a deal or fear a lesser role - or less compensation - at the combined firm.
Distant_Evaluation	Big law firm deals have a mixed track record and often result in power struggles and cultural clashes.
Distant_Historical	Most infamously, the 2007 merger of Dewey Ballantine and LeBoeuf Lamb Greene & MacRae - the largest merger of New York law firms in history - was a fiasco.
Distant_Historical	Last year, the combined firm, Dewey & LeBoeuf, collapsed in bankruptcy amid financial mismanagement and partner defections.
Distant_Historical	In 2006, Orrick had flirted with possible disaster when it had agreed to the main terms of a combination with Dewey Ballantine, but the deal fell apart after several top partners jumped ship when merger talks were leaked.
Cause_General	Orrick, with 1,100 lawyers, has talked with several firms over the past decade but never made it to the altar.
Cause_General	Pillsbury, too, recently discussed a deal with Fulbright.
Cause_General	Although today each has offices across the globe, both Orrick’s and Pillsbury’s historical roots are firmly grounded on the West Coast.
Distant_Historical	Each was started in San Francisco in the 1860s in the wake of the California gold rush.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A merger would create a formidable presence in Silicon Valley, which has become an area of expansion for corporate firms.
Cause_General	In Washington, Pillsbury has an especially strong nuclear energy practice, another hot practice area.
Main	SEOUL, South Korea - An American tour operator imprisoned in North Korea on charges of plotting to harm the Socialist country through Christian missionary activities has appealed to Washington to send a high-ranking official to North Korea to help free him, according to a videotaped interview made public Tuesday.
Cause_Specific	The Choson Sinbo, a pro-North Korean newspaper based in Japan, on Tuesday posted the video footage of tour operator, Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American from Washington state, sitting in a hospital in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, where he was moved from a labor camp a week ago as his health deteriorated.
Cause_Specific	Bae, 45, had been imprisoned at the camp since May, shortly after he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for what North Korean authorities said were hostile acts against the government.
Distant_Historical	Bae was leading a group of visitors from China into the special economic zone of Rason in northeastern North Korea when he was arrested in November.
Cause_Specific	North Korean officials accused Bae of being a Christian missionary who flouted the country’s laws on proselytizing.
Distant_Evaluation	In his interview with The Choson Sinbo, Bae said he had “violated” North Korean laws.
Distant_Evaluation	“As an American citizen, I request the U.S. government to make active efforts so I can be pardoned and return home,” he said in the interview, which The Choson Sinbo said took place Friday.
Distant_Evaluation	“I think that a high-ranking U.S. official should come here and bring me home, and that such an official should come here as a representative of the U.S. government and apologize and make a request of an early pardon for my release.”
Distant_Evaluation	It was unclear whether Bae was speaking of his own free will.
Distant_Evaluation	North Korea had previously said Bae would not be used as a bargaining chip.
Distant_Evaluation	But outside analysts said the recent news of his deteriorating health and the letters he was allowed to send to his family in recent weeks, along with another videotaped interview broadcast by The Choson Sinbo and CNN last month, were probably efforts by the North Korean government to force Washington to engage in dialogue.
Distant_Evaluation	In the past, the North has used Americans held on criminal charges to bring about visits by prominent U.S. figures seeking their release, like former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton - a practice that Washington has wanted to end.
Distant_Evaluation	A visit by a high-ranking U.S. government representative would be a significant diplomatic coup for the North Korean government, which has long wanted an official dialogue with the United States.
Cause_General	Washington has insisted that there will be no such engagement until the North has shown concrete signs of giving up its nuclear weapons development.
Cause_General	In the video, Bae was also shown being visited by a Swedish diplomat.
Cause_General	Washington has no official diplomatic ties with North Korea, and the Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang represents U.S. interests in Bae’s case on Washington’s behalf.
Distant_Evaluation	Bae appeared gaunt in the video and said his various ailments, including a backache, had worsened during his time in the labor camp.
Main_Consequence	The State Department has called on the North to grant Bae amnesty and immediate release.
Error	With: BLACKBERRY-CUTS);
Main	Mike Lazaridis, the co-founder of BlackBerry who stepped down as co-chief executive in 2011, has reached out to private equity firms about a possible bid for the troubled company.
Main	Lazaridis has separately approached the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group about making an offer, according to people familiar with the matter.
Cause_General	These people cautioned, however, that the talks were preliminary and might not lead to any bids.
Distant_Evaluation	The potential of any effort to take BlackBerry private was muddied further Friday, as shares in the company tanked after the company announced quarterly revenue far below analysts’ expectations.
Cause_General	BlackBerry shares listed in the United States plunged 17.1 percent to $8.73.
Cause_General	Lazaridis could not be reached for comment.
Cause_General	Blackstone and Carlyle declined to comment.
Cause_General	The Wall Street Journal reported news of the talks late Friday.
Distant_Anecdotal	Private equity firms have been considering a bid for BlackBerry for more than a year, people familiar with the matter said.
Distant_Historical	But as late as 18 months ago, buyout specialists evaluating the company saw few viable options for turning the slumping company around.
Distant_Evaluation	Lazaridis, who co-founded BlackBerry with a friend in 1985, remains one of the company’s largest individual shareholders, and his stake would be helpful in any effort to take the company private.
Distant_Historical	Last year, Lazaridis and his partner, Jim Balsillie, stepped down as co-chief executives, ceding control to Thorsten Heins.
Distant_Historical	The two men, who had run the company for decades, had come under pressure from disgruntled shareholders as BlackBerry continued to lose market share to rivals including the iPhone and phones using Google’s Android software.
Distant_Historical	Speaking at the time of his departure last year, Lazaridis said, “In every successful company that’s developed by founders, there comes a time when it enters a new phase of growth and it’s time for the founders to pass the baton to new management.”
Main	The first former Guantanamo detainee to be tried in a civilian court was acquitted Wednesday of all but one of more than 280 charges of conspiracy and murder in the 1998 terrorist bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The case has been seen as a test of President Barack Obama's goal of trying detainees in federal court whenever feasible, and the result may again fuel debate over whether civilian courts are appropriate for trying terrorists.
Main	The defendant, Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, 36, was convicted of one count of conspiracy to destroy government buildings and property.
Main	He was acquitted of four counts of conspiracy, including conspiring to kill Americans and to use weapons of mass destruction.
Distant_Evaluation	Because of the unusual circumstances of Ghailani's case -- after he was captured in Pakistan in 2004, he was held for nearly five years in a so-called black site run by the CIA and at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- the prosecution faced significant legal hurdles even getting his case to trial.
Distant_Evaluation	On the eve of trial last month, the government lost a key ruling that may have seriously damaged its chances of winning convictions.
Cause_Specific	In the ruling, the judge, Lewis A. Kaplan of U.S. District Court in Manhattan, barred it from using an important witness against Ghailani because the government had learned about the man through Ghailani's interrogation while he was in CIA custody, where his lawyers say he was tortured.
Distant_Evaluation	"The witness, Hussein Abebe, would have testified that he had sold Ghailani the large quantities of TNT used to blow up the embassy in Dar es Salaam, prosecutors told the judge, calling him ""a giant witness for the government."""
Main	"On Wednesday, when the judge's clerk asked how the jury found on counts 11 to 223, which were all counts of murder, the jury foreman replied, ""Not guilty."""
Cause_General	Ghailani, who remains in custody, faces a sentence of 20 years to life in prison.
Cause_General	The unexpected verdict by the anonymous six-man, six-woman jury came in the fifth day of deliberations.
Distant_Evaluation	Ghailani's lawyers -- Peter E. Quijano, Steve Zissou and Michael K. Bachrach -- had argued that their client was innocent and had been duped into assisting in the terrorist conspiracy.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This verdict is a reaffirmation that this nation's judicial system is the greatest ever devised,"" Quijano said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""It is truly a system of laws and not men, where, in the shadow of the World Trade Center, this jury acquitted Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani of 284 out of 285 counts."""
Main	BEIJING – Human rights advocates have accused authorities in eastern China of denying urgent medical care to the nephew of dissident Chen Guangcheng, a move they say is aimed at punishing the uncle for his continued anti-government activism abroad after his daring escape to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing.
Cause_Specific	Family members say that the nephew, Chen Kegui, 34, has acute appendicitis but that prison officials are refusing to send him to a hospital.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’re very worried for his survival,” his father, Chen Guanfu, said Thursday, speaking from the prison in China’s Shandong province where his son is being held.
Distant_Historical	Chen Kegui was sentenced in November to 39 months in jail for “intentional injury” after he was convicted of attacking a government official who had broken into his family’s home in the frantic search for his uncle, who, although blind, had escaped house arrest from a nearby farmhouse.
Distant_Historical	Unknown to local officials, Chen Guangcheng had by then fled to Beijing and, later, to the U.S. Embassy, prompting a diplomatic imbroglio that complicated an official visit by then-Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Cause_General	Chen Guangcheng, a self-taught lawyer who was once hailed by the state media for his advocacy work, earned the government’s enmity after he took on the case of thousands of local women who had been subjected to forced abortions and sterilizations.
Distant_Historical	In 2006, he was sentenced to 51 months in jail on what supporters say were trumped-up charges; upon his release, he and his family were confined to their home.
Distant_Evaluation	His improbable escape – by scaling a wall one night and crawling through fields to freedom – deeply embarrassed the Chinese government.
Distant_Historical	After several days of tense negotiations last May, Chinese officials allowed Chen Guangcheng and his family to leave the embassy for New York.
Cause_General	Chen, now studying at New York University Law School, has continued to press for an investigation into his mistreatment and to speak out publicly about what he sees as the lack of rule of law in China.
Distant_Evaluation	The government’s response, he has said, has been an escalating campaign of intimidation against those he left behind in Dongshigu village.

Distant_Evaluation	“Please help us find Rusty,” the zoo pleaded.
Distant_Evaluation	“He could be sick and hiding.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On its Facebook page, the zoo said that Rusty, an “arboreal, territorial” creature, was most likely napping in a tree nearby.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But in an ominous note, the zoo said it was possible that Rusty had been stolen.

Main	SEOUL, South Korea - South Korean factory managers returned Wednesday to a shuttered industrial park in North Korea for the first time in two months, as the two governments resumed talks on reopening the complex, once a symbol of inter-Korean economic cooperation.
Main	Sixty factory managers from the South arrived in the Kaesong Industrial Zone, in the North Korean border town of the same name, for a day trip to check on their factories, which have been idle since the last of the managers left in late April.
Cause_Specific	North Korea halted production there in early April by withdrawing its 53,000 workers, in part blaming tensions it said were caused by joint U.S.-South Korean military drills at the time.
Cause_General	The managers inspected their manufacturing equipment before the possible resumption of operations.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	More managers planned to visit Kaesong on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	Representatives of the two Korean governments met on the border over the weekend and agreed upon the managers’ return, but they remained far apart over the terms of reopening the complex.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Suh Ho, the chief South Korean negotiator, said Wednesday that North Korea must accept “common sense and international standards” in Kaesong before the complex can be “normalized and further developed.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	South Korea is urging North Korea to take steps to assure that it will not let political and military disputes interfere again with the factory park’s operation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	South Korean President Park Geun-hye has suggested that one step would be for North Korea to agree to invite non-Korean factories to Kaesong.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The chief North Korean negotiator, Pak Chol-su, is pressing South Korea to agree to an early resumption of work at the complex, citing fears among factory owners that if their plants were not restarted soon, their equipment would start deteriorating in the monsoon season.
Distant_Evaluation	The factory managers’ return and the continuing talks were a sign that tensions between the two Koreas were easing after months of hostile exchanges, which peaked when the North threatened to attack the South with nuclear weapons and the South responded with warnings of counterattacks.
Distant_Historical	The Kaesong complex, where textile and electronic parts companies from the South employed low-cost North Korean workers, started producing goods in late 2004.
Distant_Evaluation	It is the last remaining toehold for South Korea’s efforts from a previous era to use economic cooperation to help the North open up and move toward the reunification of the peninsula.
Main	Rosalia Mera, a Spanish entrepreneur who had dropped out of school at 11 to work as a seamstress and went on to help start a global fashion empire, Zara, becoming the world’s richest self-made woman, died Aug. 15 in La Coruña, Spain.
Cause_General	She was 69.
Cause_General	Her death was announced by Inditex, the holding company that owns Zara and seven other apparel concerns.
Cause_Specific	Spanish newspapers said she had a stroke on the Mediterranean island of Minorca on Aug. 14 and was flown to a hospital in La Coruña, in northwestern Spain, where she lived.
Cause_General	Forbes magazine ranked Mera as the richest woman in Spain this year and the 66th richest woman in the world.
Cause_General	She ranked first among women who had acquired their wealth through their own efforts, rather than inheritance or marriage.
Cause_General	Her former husband, Amancio Ortega, with whom she started the company as an equal partner in 1974, is listed by Forbes as the world’s third richest man, with assets of $57 billion.
Cause_General	Mera’s wealth came from owning approximately 7 percent of Inditex stock, worth $6.1 billion.
Distant_Evaluation	Zara changed the apparel industry, chiefly by speeding up its mass-market response to new designs coming from the leading fashion houses in Paris, Milan, New York and other cities.
Cause_General	Zara could come up with its own variations on those designs and have them in stores within two weeks; previously, six months was the industry average.
Distant_Evaluation	It accomplished this through what is known as vertical integration.
Cause_General	Zara designs, produces, distributes and sells its own lines in its own retail stores - 1,763 in 86 countries, including the United States.
Cause_General	It uses no subcontractors or intermediaries and relies little on advertising.
Cause_General	Devotees of the Zara label include the Duchess of Cambridge, the former Kate Middleton.
Distant_Evaluation	Zara takes an extra step in getting daily feedback from its many stores.
Cause_General	The company can incorporate customer desires by modifying a design and shipping the new product out within days.
Distant_Evaluation	The company says it takes care not to violate copyright laws in following designer trends.
Distant_Historical	In 1985, Zara and its “fast fashion” model came under the corporate umbrella of Industria de Diseno Textil, or Inditex S.A., a conglomerate whose eight brand names, each with its own chain of stores, aim at specific markets.
Cause_General	Massimo Dutti, for example, targets urban cosmopolites, while Bershka is youth-oriented.
Distant_Historical	In 2001, when Inditex shares were first sold to the public, Daniel Piette, fashion director for Louis Vuitton SA, called it “possibly the most innovative and devastating retailer in the world.”
Distant_Historical	Rosalía Mera Goyenechea was born on Jan. 28, 1944, in a working-class neighborhood of La Coruña, a port city in Galicia, a center of Spain’s textile industry.
Distant_Historical	Her father worked for a utility company and her mother for a butcher shop.
Distant_Historical	Mera skipped secondary school and in 1963 met Ortega, the son of a railroad worker and a maid who had left school at 13 to work as a delivery boy for a shirt maker.
Distant_Historical	When they met, he was working at one clothing shop in La Coruña and she at another.
Distant_Historical	They married in 1966.
Distant_Historical	In their living room, they began making quilted bathrobes and lingerie that Mera had designed.
Distant_Evaluation	The London newspaper The Independent said in its obituary of Mera that her lingerie designs were “a bit shocking at the time” but immediately popular.
Distant_Evaluation	The newspaper suggested that this new liberalism in undergarments reflected a slight breeze of change in the final years of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco.
Distant_Historical	The couple soon expanded the business, setting up manufacturing operations, employing hundreds and later opening their own store.
Distant_Historical	At first they wanted to call the store Zorba after watching the 1964 film “Zorba the Greek.” But after discovering that there was a bar named Zorba two blocks away, and since they had already made the molds for the letters spelling Zorba for a storefront sign, they simply rearranged them to see what they could find.
Distant_Historical	They settled on Zara.
Distant_Historical	The business eventually expanded to other Spanish cities, then to Portugal, then around the world.
Distant_Historical	The couple separated in 1986 and divorced in the 1990s.
Distant_Historical	Mera stopped working at Zara after the separation but remained on the board until 2004.
Cause_General	She devoted more time to charity work, much of it through a foundation that she and her husband had set up to help disabled people.
Distant_Historical	Mera made $600 million from Inditex’s public stock offering in 2001 and diversified her investments, buying stakes in a fish-farming group, a company that looks for cancer treatments in ocean products, and the maker of a fingerprinting system for newborns.
Distant_Historical	She was a major investor in the Bulgari Hotel in London.
Distant_Historical	For years Mera could be seen in La Coruña at the movies or pubs.
Cause_General	She was also politically active, speaking out against tightening Spain’s abortion laws and cutbacks to health care and education programs.
Distant_Historical	She visited the camps of protesters against capitalism’s excesses, a precursor to the Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States.
Cause_General	Survivors include a son, Marcos Ortega, and a daughter, Sandra Ortega.

Distant_Evaluation	LONDON - To the Italian police, he was Domenico Rancadore, or “the professor,” a Mafia boss on the lam as a dangerous fugitive for almost two decades, a onetime enforcer for the Sicilian Cosa Nostra.
Distant_Evaluation	To those who lived near him on a leafy street in a bland West London suburb, he was Marc Skinner, a father of two, a former teacher and a good neighbor who spent contented hours buffing the paint jobs on his fancy cars.
Cause_General	But this week, his double life began unraveling.
Main	A British judge denied him bail Friday, two days after his arrest on an international warrant seeking his extradition to Italy to serve a seven-year sentence for extortion and other crimes.
Distant_Evaluation	Right until the brief court hearing Friday, there had been speculation that he would be freed because of technical flaws in the warrant.
Distant_Evaluation	At a separate hearing the day before, Judge Quentin Purdy of Westminster Magistrates’ Court said, “There are concerns about the validity of the warrant that has come before the court.”
Cause_Specific	But Friday, while Rancadore, 64, was still in a police holding cell, a new warrant was issued.
Main	At the court hearing later, Purdy denied his bail request, meaning that Rancadore will remain in custody while he awaits extradition proceedings.
Distant_Historical	According to court filings in London, Rancadore was sentenced in 1999 to seven years in prison after being tried in absentia and convicted of extortion, membership in the Mafia and other serious crimes.
Distant_Historical	The Italian authorities placed him on a list of “dangerous fugitives,” the Italian Interior Ministry said, because he had been a “man of honor” in Cosa Nostra.
Distant_Historical	As a top Mafia member, the Italian authorities said, Rancadore went by the sobriquet U Profissuri, the professor, from a Mafia clan in Trabia near Palermo, the Sicilian capital.
Distant_Historical	Italian investigators believe that Rancadore fled Italy in the early 1990s because of an internal conflict, when the “boss of all bosses,” Salvatore Riina, ordered the killing of two top anti-Mafia prosecutors.
Distant_Historical	The Italian police issued an international arrest warrant in 1998.
Cause_General	For almost two decades, Rancadore lived in England under the assumed name of Marc Skinner, using the maiden name of his wife, Anne, and leading an innocuous life in London’s outer fringes, far from the perennial battle in Sicily between the authorities and the mob.
Distant_Anecdotal	Joan Hills, 76, who lives nearby, told The Independent that Rancadore was “one of the best neighbors you could ever have.”
Main	BEIJING – A North Korean envoy visiting China said his country would “accept the proposal” by Chinese officials to open up dialogue, the China News Service reported Thursday, a possible signal that the North would agree to talks on its nuclear program.
Cause_General	The comments were reported after the envoy, Marshal Choe Ryong-hae, met Liu Yunshan, who is a member of the Communist Party Standing Committee and the politician who heads ideological affairs for the Communist Party.
Distant_Evaluation	Liu was quoted as repeating a frequent appeal by China for a resumption of talks that would result in the removal of nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula “as soon as possible.”
Distant_Evaluation	Few diplomats believe that the North is prepared to be involved in so-called six-party talks that aim to strip North Korea of its nuclear weapons.
Distant_Historical	The international six-party talks on the North’s nuclear program – involving the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan and Russia – collapsed in 2008 after North Korea walked out, but the United States has been pushing in recent weeks for them to be restarted.
Distant_Evaluation	China is North Korea’s biggest benefactor, but relations have been strained in recent months.
Distant_Evaluation	Experts say the North bridles at China’s stiff demands for low-priced natural resources, and that Chinese officials are annoyed by the North’s defiance of entreaties to refrain from missile and nuclear tests, the lastest of which was conducted in February.
Cause_Specific	The visit by Choe, a close aide to the North’s new leader, Kim Jong Un, was seen by many analysts as a fence-mending mission.
Distant_Evaluation	Choe, 72, was quoted by the China News Service as being “highly” appreciative of “China’s huge efforts to maintain peace and stability” on the Korean Peninsula.
Cause_General	There have been no reports so far of Choe meeting with senior Chinese officials involved in foreign policy and military affairs.
Cause_General	The publicized meetings have been with senior officials of the Communist Party who are the usual interlocutors with North Korea.
Cause_General	On Wednesday, Choe met with Wang Jiarui, head of the International Department of the Communist Party of China.
Cause_General	The North Korean news agency said Choe visited an industrial park in Beijing on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	China’s basic advice to North Korea has been that it should reform its economy following the path of Deng Xiaoping, with special economic zones and some private enterprise.
Distant_Evaluation	Although North Korea has sometimes embarked on such reforms, the government has later pulled back, perhaps for fear of losing control in one of the world’s most tightly controlled countries.
Distant_Evaluation	North Korean experts in China say they detect little change in China’s underlying policy of supporting North Korea.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But the Chinese leadership would like North Korea to modify its erratic behavior, stop nuclear tests and halt its missile program, they say.
Distant_Evaluation	How to reach that goal with Kim has not been resolved, some of the analysts said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The marshal’s visit came just days after the announcement that President Xi Jingping of China and President Barack Obama intended to meet in California next month, suggesting that the North was concerned that its recent actions had pushed China and the United States closer.
Distant_Evaluation	Wang Gunsheng, an analyst at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said the visit of Choe could be interpreted as a “kind of apology” by North Korea for its recent behavior.
Main	PARIS – Five people were convicted Monday in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, in connection with an elaborate organ-trafficking network that lured poor people to the country to sell their kidneys and other organs to wealthy transplant recipients from Israel, the United States, Canada and Germany.
Cause_General	Organs sold for as much as $130,000 each.
Cause_General	The defendants, all Kosovars, were tried before a panel of two European Union judges and one Kosovar judge.
Distant_Evaluation	A special prosecutor for the union, Jonathan Ratel, called the case a landmark because doctors had been convicted.
Main	Dr. Lutfi Dervishi, a urologist and the director of the clinic at the center of the trafficking ring, was sentenced to eight years in prison.
Main	His son Arban Dervishi was sentenced to seven years and three months, and Dr. Sokol Hajdini, the clinic’s chief anesthesiologist, to three years.
Main	Two other defendants received one-year suspended sentences.
Cause_General	In addition to the five who were convicted, two defendants were acquitted of charges of fraud and abuse of authority.
Cause_General	All had denied any wrongdoing.
Distant_Evaluation	“The sole and driving motive for this exploitation of the poor and the indigent was the opportunity for obscene profit and human greed,” Ratel, the prosecutor, said Monday.
Distant_Evaluation	“In every sense this was a cruel harvest of the poor.”
Main_Consequence	The case has shaken Kosovo, a mostly Muslim country of 2 million that broke away from Serbia in 2008 in the aftermath of the Balkan wars of the 1990s and has been struggling to shed a culture of lawlessness and corruption.
Cause_General	This month, Kosovo and Serbia reached an agreement that the Kosovo government hopes will accelerate its integration into the international community, including membership in the United Nations.
Cause_Specific	According to the indictment in the case, traffickers in the network promised payments of up to $26,000 to poor people in Turkey, Moldova and Russia to persuade them to travel to Kosovo and donate an organ.
Cause_Specific	They were asked to sign false documents saying they were donating to a relative for humanitarian reasons.
Cause_Specific	Two dozen donors were taken in by the scheme; many were never given any compensation and were released without adequate medical care.
Cause_Specific	The wealthy, ailing patients who were to receive the organs flew to Pristina for transplant operations at a clinic called Medicus.
Cause_Specific	It was founded by a well-meaning European philanthropist who helped local doctors during the war in Kosovo in 1999, but prosecutors said it was later transformed into an illegal organ transplant hub by Dervishi, a surgeon and professor at Pristina University Hospital.
Distant_Evaluation	Ratel said the Dervishis were aided by Dr. Yusuf Sonmez, whom he called a notorious international organ trafficker.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Sonmez is a fugitive and may be in South Africa, Ratel said.
Cause_Specific	The big breakthrough in the case happened in November 2008, Ratel said, when a young Turkish man was found at the Pristina airport, weak and shaking, with a large surgical scar on his left abdomen.
Cause_Specific	The man told the police that his kidney had been stolen.
Cause_Specific	When the police raided the clinic, they found a frail elderly Israeli man who had paid $90,000 for the kidney.
Distant_Evaluation	Petrit Selimi, the deputy foreign minister of Kosovo, said the verdict showed that the rule of law was working in the country.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Illegal organ transplants are a scourge of poorer nations from Kamchatka to Kosovo, and we will continue to chase criminals engaged in it,” Selimi said.
Cause_General	NEW YORK – During the sentencing of the former hedge fund manager Anthony Chiasson on Monday, Judge Richard J. Sullivan marveled at his prodigious wealth, ticking off the annual income listed on his tax returns.
Distant_Evaluation	“$16 million, $10 million, $23 million,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s hard to imagine why someone would risk all that to engage in a crime like this,” the judge said.
Cause_Specific	The crime is insider trading, and Sullivan of U.S. District Court in Manhattan handed down one of the stiffest sentences yet in the government’s vast campaign to root out wrongdoing on Wall Street trading floors.
Main	He sentenced Chiasson, a founder of Level Global Investors, to 6 1/2 years in prison after a jury found him guilty in December of illegally trading technology stocks.
Distant_Evaluation	“This kind of conduct can’t go unpunished,” Sullivan said.
Cause_General	Chiasson, 39, who did not address the court, was ordered to pay a $5 million fine and forfeit illegally obtained proceeds of as much as $2 million.
Cause_General	He must report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons in 90 days.
Cause_General	His legal team, led by Reid H. Weingarten of Steptoe & Johnson and Gregory Morvillo of Morvillo Law, is appealing his conviction.
Cause_General	They have brought on Mark F. Pomerantz, a lawyer at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, to handle the appeal.
Distant_Historical	Chiasson was tried last year alongside Todd Newman, a former portfolio manager at Diamondback Capital Management.
Distant_Historical	The government accused them of being the two most senior Wall Street traders in an eight-member “criminal club” that made $72 million in profits by trading shares of Dell and Nvidia based on corporate secrets obtained from inside those companies.
Distant_Historical	After a six-week trial, a jury convicted Chiasson and Newman.
Cause_General	Earlier this month, Sullivan sentenced Newman to 4 1/2 years in prison.
Cause_General	Chiasson’s case is one of several insider-trading prosecutions that have touched SAC Capital Advisors, the giant hedge fund owned by the billionaire stock picker Steven A. Cohen that has become a central target of the government’s investigation.
Cause_General	Prosecutors charged two former SAC employees with participating in the insider-trading ring involving Chiasson.
Cause_General	Jon Horvath, a former SAC technology stock analyst, has admitted to being a part of the scheme.
Cause_General	In March, Horvath’s boss, Michael S. Steinberg, was indicted.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He is fighting the charges and is scheduled to go on trial in November before Sullivan.
Main	DHAKA, Bangladesh - A factory building that collapsed last month outside Dhaka, killing more than 1,000 workers in the deadliest disaster in the history of the garment industry, was constructed with substandard materials and in blatant disregard for building codes, a high-level government report issued Wednesday concluded.
Main	The 400-page report on the collapse of the Rana Plaza building in Savar, an industrial suburb of Dhaka, the capital, found widespread fault for the April 24 disaster, which killed 1,127 people.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It blamed the mayor for wrongly granting construction approvals and recommended charges for the building’s owner, Sohel Rana, as well for as the owners of the five garment factories in the building, that could result in life sentences if they are convicted.
Main	The factory owners urged workers to return to their jobs despite evidence that the building was unsafe, the report said.
Distant_Evaluation	“They compelled them to start,” said Main Uddin Khandaker, a high-ranking official in Bangladesh’s Home Ministry, who led the investigation.
Distant_Evaluation	The Rana Plaza disaster has focused global attention on unsafe conditions in the garment industry in Bangladesh, which is now the world’s second-leading exporter of clothing, trailing only China.
Cause_General	Bangladesh has more than 5,000 garment factories, handling orders for nearly all of the world’s top brands and retailers.
Distant_Evaluation	It has become an export powerhouse largely by delivering lower costs, in part by having the lowest wages in the world for garment workers.
Main	Rana Plaza was a disaster waiting to happen, the government report suggested.
Main	Rana illegally constructed upper floors to house garment factories employing several thousand workers, it said.
Main	Large power generators placed on these upper floors, necessary because of regular power failures, would shake the poorly constructed building whenever they were switched on, according to the report.
Cause_Specific	On April 23, cracks had appeared in the building, shaking the structure enough that many workers fled.
Distant_Anecdotal	An engineer called to inspect the structure warned that it was unsafe.
Main	Yet Rana and the factory bosses discounted any concerns and ordered their workers into the building the next morning, the government report concluded.
Cause_Specific	A generator soon switched on, and the building buckled and collapsed, in what became a scene of horror.
Main	Khandaker’s report recommended that Rana and the factory owners be charged with culpable homicide.
Distant_Evaluation	He also suggested that Rana had bribed local officials for construction approvals.
Distant_Evaluation	COLTS NECK, N.J. – With 10 children kneeling around the altar for their first communion and the pews at St. Mary’s Church packed with families gathered for Mother’s Day, there was little sign Sunday of the turmoil that has struck the parish, and threatens the Archdiocese of Newark.
Main	Just two weeks earlier, the parishioners learned that a minister working with their church’s youth groups had been barred from being around children unsupervised – a restriction he accepted to avoid retrial on a sex abuse charge.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I think everyone was just shocked; there’s no other way to put it,” Darren Barreiro, a father of three girls, said as he left Mass on Sunday.
Distant_Historical	The priest, Michael Fugee, was convicted in 2003 of criminal sexual conduct stemming from allegations that he had groped a boy’s crotch during several wrestling horseplay encounters when he was associate pastor at St. Elizabeth Church in Wyckoff.
Distant_Historical	Three years later, an appellate court overturned the conviction, in part because the judge allowed jurors to hear a statement Fugee made to the police saying he was attracted to males, according to The Star-Ledger of Newark.
Cause_Specific	Rather than begin another trial, Fugee and the Bergen County prosecutor’s office signed an agreement that he would enter sex-offender treatment and have no unsupervised contact with children as part of his church duties.
Cause_Specific	The 2007 agreement was also signed by the Archdiocese of Newark, which was required to ensure that Fugee was not assigned any tasks that would put him in a position to have unsupervised contact with children, including involvement with youth groups, attending youth retreats or hearing confessions of children.
Distant_Historical	Fugee’s name came up again in 2009, when he was appointed chaplain at St. Michael’s Medical Center in Newark, a position the Newark Archdiocese said did not put him in contact with children because the hospital did not have a pediatric unit.
Distant_Historical	But after inquiries, he was removed from that post.
Distant_Historical	Late last year, the Newark archbishop, John J. Myers, assigned Fugee to become co-director of the Office of Continuing Education and Ongoing Formation of Priests, which caused critics of how the church has handled sex abuse issues among its clergy to call for Myers to step down.
Cause_General	That criticism escalated after The Star-Ledger published an article on April 28 revealing that Fugee had been working with youth groups at St. Mary’s, which falls under the jurisdiction of the Trenton Archdiocese.
Cause_General	The article said the priest had attended weekend youth retreats, traveled with the church’s youth group to Canada, and heard confessions from minors behind closed doors.
Distant_Evaluation	On Wednesday, Steve Sweeney, president of the New Jersey Senate, released a statement calling the accusations “deeply disturbing.”
Distant_Evaluation	“Those who are put in a position of trust, whether it be through elected office, as a coach, or as a person of faith, must be held to a higher standard,” the statement said.
Distant_Evaluation	“And when we are talking about children, that need to trust those in charge leaves absolutely no margin for error.
Distant_Evaluation	Archbishop Myers must step down now.”
Distant_Evaluation	Myers was unaware of Fugee’s work in Colts Neck until the archdiocese was asked about it by a Star-Ledger reporter, his spokesman, James Goodness, said Sunday.
Cause_General	When he learned of the work, Myers moved to suspend Fugee, who voluntarily left the ministry May 2, Goodness said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The archbishop, who will return this week from a previously scheduled trip to Poland, plans to speak publicly about the issue soon after, Goodness said.
Distant_Evaluation	The Diocese of Trenton also said it was unaware of Fugee’s involvement with the Colts Neck church until it was contacted by a reporter.
Cause_General	The archdiocese said the parish’s two youth group ministers, Michael and Amy Lenehan, had improperly invited Fugee to participate in the youth program without approval from the diocese or the church’s pastor, the Rev.
Cause_General	Thomas J. Triggs.
Main	During Masses on the weekend of May 4 and 5, a statement from the Trenton bishop, David M. O’Connell, was read to parishioners in Colts Neck, saying the “troubling events” made clear that a change in leadership was in the best interest of everyone involved.
Main	The statement said the Lenehans had resigned and that Triggs was being reassigned.
Main	“There are few things in life as important as protecting our children and young people,” O’Connell said in the statement, adding that he prayed “that this community of faith will move forward together, that any anger or hurt will subside and that the Lord will bless our efforts to serve one another in his name.”
Cause_General	A note tucked into the program for Mass on Sunday announced that the Rev.
Cause_General	Jeffrey Lee, the pastor of Our Lady of Angels Church in Trenton, would be the church’s new pastor.
Cause_General	In services Sunday, Lee made no mention of the recent troubles.
Main	JERUSALEM – Four young brothers who had fled the civil war in Syria were killed in a fire that engulfed four tents in the Zaatari refugee camp near Jordan’s northern border, the aid worker who runs the camp said Saturday.
Cause_Specific	Kilian Kleinschmidt of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said that there were conflicting reports as to whether the Friday night fire was started by a candle or an electrical short-circuit, but that he believed it was accidental, in contrast to previous fires that officials suspect were deliberately set to protest conditions in the camp.
Distant_Evaluation	“This looks like a genuine fire,” said Kleinschmidt, director of the Zaatari camp.
Distant_Evaluation	“This tragic incident highlights even more so how vulnerable the kids are in displacement and refuge.”
Cause_General	Zaatari, the largest camp of Syrian refugees in the region, has more than 100,000 residents, nearly 60 percent of them children; more than half live in tents.
Main	Kleinschmidt said the four brothers from the Mubarak family – Salem, 6; Mahmoud, 5; Yasen, 4; and Mohammad, 3 – had suffered burns over 80 percent of their bodies and died in a local hospital, two Friday night and two Saturday.
Main_Consequence	Kleinschmidt said residents from the area of the camp where the fire broke out had stormed the registration compound Saturday morning to demand that their tents be replaced by the prefabricated units known as caravans.
Main_Consequence	After a series of meetings, Kleinschmidt said, his staff agreed to provide caravans immediately to about half the refugees in the area if they moved to a less crowded spot.
Distant_Evaluation	“We came to that deal,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“The main thing for me was to keep peace there.”

Main	SANFORD, Fla. - George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager, igniting a national debate on racial profiling and civil rights, was found not guilty late Saturday of second-degree murder.
Main	He also was acquitted of manslaughter, a lesser charge.
Cause_Specific	After three weeks of testimony, the six-woman jury rejected the prosecution’s contention that Zimmerman had deliberately pursued Martin because he assumed the hoodie-clad teenager was a criminal and instigated the fight that led to his death.
Distant_Historical	Zimmerman said he shot Martin on Feb. 26, 2012, in self-defense after the teenager knocked him to the ground, punched him and slammed his head repeatedly against the sidewalk.
Cause_Specific	In finding him not guilty of murder or manslaughter, the jury agreed that Zimmerman could have been justified in shooting Martin because he feared great bodily harm or death.
Cause_General	Saturday night, when the verdict was read, Zimmerman, 29, smiled slightly.
Cause_General	His wife, Shellie, and several of his friends wept, and his parents kissed and embraced.
Cause_General	Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin, who lost their son a few weeks after his 17th birthday, were not in the courtroom.
Distant_Evaluation	In a statement released early Sunday, their attorney, Benjamin Crump, said the family was heartbroken and they thanked people around the world for their support.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Trayvon Martin will forever remain in the annals of history next to Medgar Evers and Emmett Till,” he said, “as symbols for the fight for equal justice for all.”
Cause_General	After the verdict, Judge Debra S. Nelson, of Seminole County Court, told Zimmerman, who has been in hiding and wears a bulletproof vest outside, that his bond was revoked and his GPS monitor would be cut off.
Cause_General	“You have no further business with the court,” she said.
Cause_General	Outside the courthouse, perhaps 100 protesters who had been gathering through the night, their numbers building as the hours passed, began pumping their fists in the air, waving placards and chanting “No justice, no peace!” Sheriff’s deputies lined up inside the courthouse, watching the crowd, who were chanting peacefully, but intently.
Cause_General	By 11:20, more than an hour after the verdict had been read, the crowd had begun to dwindle.
Distant_Anecdotal	Among the last of the protesters to leave the courthouse lawn was Mattie Aikens, 33, of Sanford.
Distant_Anecdotal	She had been standing outside since noon, and was still shocked.
Distant_Anecdotal	“He should have went to prison,” she said.
Distant_Anecdotal	“He should have just got guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.”
Distant_Evaluation	Mark O’Mara, one of Zimmerman’s lawyers, said, “George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except firing the gun in self-defense.”
Distant_Evaluation	Calling it a “very trying time,” Crump, the Martin family attorney, said he had urged Martin’s parents to stay out of the courtroom for the verdict.
Cause_General	They were home and planning to attend church Sunday.
Distant_Evaluation	The parents, he said, were grateful for all the support.
Cause_General	Crump asked the family’s supporters to keep the peace and read a Twitter post by Bernice King, the Rev.
Cause_General	Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s daughter.
Distant_Evaluation	“Whatever the Zimmerman verdict is,” Crump read, “in the words of my father, we must conduct ourselves on the higher plane of dignity and discipline.”

Cause_General	Barron is married to former Globe editorial columnist Juliette Kayyem, a candidate for Massachusetts governor.
Cause_General	In addition to teaching at Harvard, he served for 18 months in the Obama administration as acting assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice.
Distant_Historical	Barron came under criticism in October 2011 for drafting the Obama administration’s secret legal memorandum that justified the controversial killing, without a trial, of the American-born Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical Muslim cleric hiding in Yemen.
Distant_Historical	He was killed in spite of an executive order banning assassinations.
Distant_Historical	The White House defended the memorandum and the killing.
Cause_General	Barron’s nomination was supported by lifelong Republican John F. Manning, a colleague at Harvard Law School, as well as Charles Fried, also a Harvard professor and solicitor general to President Reagan.
Distant_Evaluation	If his nomination is approved, Barron would replace Court of Appeals Judge Michael Boudin, who assumed senior status, or semiretired status, in June.
Distant_Historical	Boudin, who has sat on the court since 1992, was the author of the First Circuit’s historic decision that struck down the federal Defense of Marriage Act in 2012.
Distant_Historical	The Supreme Court, in a separate case, later ruled the law unconstitutional.
Main	Mastroianni, a former state prosecutor and private lawyer who became district attorney in 2011, was nominated to replace US District Court Michael Ponsor, the Springfield sitting federal judge who took senior status in August 2011.

Distant_Evaluation	''These individuals have demonstrated the talent, expertise, and fair-mindedness Americans expect and deserve from their judicial system,'' Obama said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''I am grateful for their willingness to serve and confident that they will apply the law with the utmost impartiality and integrity.''
Cause_General	According to campaign finance reports, Barron and Talwani have donated to federal political candidates: Barron gave $4,000 to Obama and $1,500 to Warren.
Cause_General	He has also given to Representative Joseph Kennedy III and Senator Edward J. Markey.
Distant_Historical	Talwani gave $200 to Warren in 2011 and $1,000 to Secretary of State John F. Kerry’s presidential campaign in 2004.
Distant_Evaluation	Retired US District Court Judge Nancy Gertner, who teaches at Harvard Law and headed Warren’s advisory committee that made the recommendations to Obama, said the panel worked quickly so that the positions would be filled.
Distant_Evaluation	But, she said, the committee also took caution to follow Warren’s call for nominations with diverse backgrounds: not only in race and gender, but also in their legal backgrounds.
Distant_Evaluation	Gertner said a priority was to find potential judges who did not have the typical background of being a federal prosecutor or coming from a large law firm.
Distant_Evaluation	''The senator very much wanted to improve the diversity of the bench, not just racial and gender, but with economic diversity, and people who had different histories,'' Gertner said.
Distant_Evaluation	''There’s a perspective that is missing on the bench, so we were charged with trying to do something about background diversity, and I’m very proud of my senator and very proud of my committee.''

Cause_General	LOS ANGELES - The police here were preparing for another night of protests on Tuesday, and community activists were working to maintain the peace after anger over the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin turned violent in South Los Angeles on Monday night.
Main	A group of about 150 mostly young people broke away from a peaceful demonstration in the Crenshaw district, long home to many of the city’s black residents.
Main	Protesters ran through the streets, blocking traffic, hitting cars, assaulting pedestrians and ransacking businesses, the police reported.
Main_Consequence	Hundreds of police officers in riot gear descended on the area to quell the unrest.
Main_Consequence	Fourteen people were arrested, the police said, half of them juveniles.
Distant_Evaluation	Two decades after the acquittal of white Los Angeles police officers in the beating of Rodney King sparked deadly riots in the same part of the city, residents and public officials agreed that the more muted anger over the Zimmerman verdict in Florida - and the much smaller outbreak of violence - showed how much, and how little, has changed.
Distant_Evaluation	“Twenty-one years ago we witnessed what could happen when there’s a reaction to a verdict,” Mark Ridley-Thomas, a Los Angeles County supervisor who represents South Los Angeles, said at a news conference on Monday night.
Distant_Evaluation	“Similar sentiments are being expressed here in this space, but the response of the LAPD is qualitatively different.”
Distant_Evaluation	Many in the neighborhood, while remaining wary of law enforcement officials, agreed that relations between black residents and the Police Department had vastly improved.
Cause_Specific	The police allowed the demonstration to continue until the violence began.
Distant_Anecdotal	“The police did a top-notch job,” said Trebien Bellows, 46, a lifelong neighborhood resident.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I have to give it up for the new police chief.
Distant_Anecdotal	Before things got crazy, they jumped right on it.” Charlie Beck was appointed police chief in 2009.
Distant_Evaluation	Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., in a speech Tuesday at the NAACP convention in Orlando, Fla., condemned Florida’s Stand Your Ground law.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s time to question laws that senselessly expand the concept of self-defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“These laws try to fix something that was never broken.”
Cause_General	The unrest in Los Angeles followed consecutive nights of largely peaceful protests in cities like Atlanta, Chicago, New York and Washington.
Cause_General	In Oakland, Calif., demonstrators blocked traffic along Interstate 880 for a brief period during the afternoon rush Monday before authorities were able to clear the road.

Main	JERUSALEM - President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority on Sunday accepted the resignation of his prime minister, Rami Hamdallah, who had asked to quit two weeks after being sworn into office.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The latest power struggles in the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule, deepened the image of political disarray, days before Secretary of State John Kerry was expected back in the region to try to revive peace talks with Israel.
Distant_Evaluation	But in what appeared to be an effort to project a minimal level of stability, a spokesman for Abbas told the official Palestinian news agency Wafa that Abbas asked Hamdallah to stay on in a caretaker role until a replacement could be found.
Cause_Specific	Hamdallah had replaced Salam Fayyad, an internationally respected economist who served as prime minister for six years.
Cause_Specific	Fayyad quit in April, partly because of a dispute over his powers, but he stayed on as a caretaker until Hamdallah’s appointment.
Cause_Specific	Palestinian officials said that Hamdallah had resigned because of a conflict over his authority and responsibilities, and they suggested that his primary problem was with his two deputy prime ministers.
Cause_General	A university dean and professor of linguistics, Hamdallah took office with no experience in politics or government, but he was known to be close to Fatah, Abbas’ mainstream party.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	When Hamdallah was tapped for the post of prime minister, some Palestinian analysts said they expected him to be compliant and not clash with Abbas, an assumption that made Hamdallah’s swift resignation all the more surprising.
Distant_Evaluation	Mahdi Abdul Hadi, the director of the Palestinian Academic Society for the Study of International Affairs, an independent research institute in East Jerusalem, said the Palestinian Authority was at “a real impasse,” stuck between the Israeli occupation and halfhearted efforts to reconcile with Hamas, the rival Islamic group that controls the coastal Palestinian territory of Gaza.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is not a question of who the prime minister is,” Abdul Hadi said, “but of where the Palestinian Authority is heading.”
Cause_General	The Palestinian public, which reacted largely with apathy to the political disarray, found some unifying cheer this weekend after a singer from Gaza, Muhammad Assaf, 23, won the title of “Arab Idol” in a popular, pan-Arab singing contest fashioned on the British and U.S. versions.

Main	WASHINGTON - The gunman who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard on Monday test fired an AR-15 assault rifle at a Virginia gun store last week and tried to buy one but was prevented from doing so because Virginia state law prohibits the sale of such weapons to out-of-state buyers, according to two senior law enforcement officials.
Main_Consequence	Instead, the gunman, Aaron Alexis of Texas, bought a law-enforcement-style shotgun - an 870 Remington pump - and used it Monday as he rampaged through the Navy facility, said the officials, who requested anonymity because of the continuing investigation.
Distant_Evaluation	“The gun was broken in half, and he had it in a bag,” one official said of the Remington.
Distant_Evaluation	“He went inside the building and assembled it in a bathroom.”
Cause_General	The gunman then perched himself above an atrium where he fired down on people who had been eating breakfast.
Cause_General	He used shotgun shells that had roughly a dozen large ball-bearing-like shots in them, increasing the lethal nature of each shot.
Distant_Evaluation	“When he discharged, the pieces of lead would spread the farther they went,” the official said.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is similar to weapons used in bird shooting but on a more serious scale.
Distant_Evaluation	These were not bullets but many small pieces of lead flying through the air.”
Distant_Evaluation	After firing down on the people, the gunman began to search for more people to shoot, according to the law enforcement officials.
Cause_General	As he searched, he was confronted by a security guard near an exit.
Cause_General	The gunman shot the security guard and took his semiautomatic handgun, then headed back to atrium.
Distant_Evaluation	“He runs back upstairs and cranks off more rounds with the handgun and then heads to another stairwell where he confronts a worker there and shoots him,” one of the officials said.
Cause_General	The gunman is believed to have shot the Navy employee, who worked in maintenance, with the pistol near another exit.
Cause_General	The most recent account from the law enforcement officials was based on hundreds of interviews that investigators conducted over the past day and hours of video footage analyzed by FBI agents and analysts.
Distant_Evaluation	Despite statements from senior law enforcement officials Monday that an AR-15 had been found at the scene, no such gun has been found, and the authorities say they do not believe the gunman used one.
Distant_Evaluation	It is unclear if Alexis’ psychiatric issues ever progressed to the point that he was involuntarily committed to a mental health institution, or determined officially to be mentally ill, either of which would have barred him from purchasing a gun.
Distant_Evaluation	If neither applied - and most people who are treated for mental illness never get to that point - then his situation would be similar to other mass shooters, like Jared L. Loughner, who killed six people and wounded 12, including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, in Tucson, Ariz., in 2011, and James E. Holmes, who killed 12 people and wounded dozens of others in a Colorado movie theater in 2012.
Cause_General	Mental health experts point out that the vast majority of people with mental illness are never violent.
Cause_General	On the other hand, studies have found an increased risk for violence among those with serious mental illness, including schizophrenia, major depression or bipolar disorder.

Main	GENEVA - The U.N. human rights chief, Navi Pillay, on Friday condemned Iraq’s execution of 42 prisoners over two days this week, denouncing such mass executions as “obscene and inhuman” and warning that they undermined efforts to reduce violence and achieve a more stable society.
Distant_Evaluation	Iraq’s justice system is “too deeply flawed to warrant even a limited use of the death penalty, let alone dozens of executions at a time,” Pillay said in a statement released in Geneva, repeating a view she has expressed on several occasions.
Distant_Evaluation	At least some of the latest executions, which were carried out Wednesday and Thursday, breached international law because Iraq is unable to hold fair trials, Pillay’s spokesman, Rupert Colville, told reporters.
Distant_Evaluation	And Iraq’s decision to proceed with executions Thursday, which was World Day Against the Death Penalty, was “particularly perverse,” Pillay said.
Cause_General	Iraq’s Justice Ministry said the executed prisoners had been convicted of “terrorist crimes, killing dozens of innocents in addition to other crimes aimed at destabilizing the country, causing chaos and spreading horror.”
Distant_Evaluation	Pillay also expressed concern about the “dramatic and shocking increase” in Iraq’s resort to the death penalty.
Cause_General	This week’s executions brought to 140 the number of people executed so far this year, compared with 123 in 2012 and 18 in 2010, the United Nations reported.
Main_Consequence	Pillay will be in direct contact with Iraqi authorities in the coming days, Colville said, but in the meantime she urged the government to immediately halt executions and to commute the sentences of about 900 prisoners now held on death row.
Distant_Evaluation	U.N. human rights officials say the integrity of the judicial system has been tainted, citing the numerous reports of confessions obtained through torture and ill-treatment, the weakness of the judiciary and trial procedures that fall far short of international standards.
Distant_Evaluation	They also said some of the offenses for which prisoners are executed did not meet the threshold of “most serious crimes,” which international law sets for the use of the death penalty.
Distant_Evaluation	Iraq’s justification for using the death penalty as a deterrent to terrorism was “clearly exposed as a fallacy” by the sharp rise in civilian casualties over the same period, Pillay noted.
Cause_General	The rash of recent bombings in the capital, Baghdad, and other parts of the country had driven up civilian casualties to the highest level since 2008, Pillay observed.
Main	Kodak said Monday that it would spin off its document and personal imaging units to its British pension plan for $650 million in cash and noncash considerations, a move that paves the way for Kodak’s exit from bankruptcy protection.
Cause_Specific	Kodak had been seeking to sell off the two imaging operations.
Cause_General	Two weeks ago, Eastman Kodak announced a plan to sell its document imaging business to Brother of Japan for $210 million, with the provision that it could revisit the deal if it could sell both units together.
Distant_Evaluation	Now the bankrupt film pioneer has struck an even more advantageous deal after a protracted sales process.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	More important, the pension plan will settle its bankruptcy claim of $2.8 billion, paving the way for the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On Tuesday, Kodak plans to file a draft plan to emerge from bankruptcy.
Distant_Evaluation	“In one comprehensive transaction, Kodak will realize its previously announced intention to divest its personalized imaging and document imaging businesses and settle its largest legacy liability,” Antonio M. Perez, Kodak’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.
Distant_Historical	The company had filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2012 and has been selling off various assets since then.
Distant_Historical	In December, Kodak reached an agreement to sell 1,100 digital imaging patents to a consortium of technology companies for $525 million, far less than expected.
Distant_Historical	But as part of that sale, Kodak retained a license to use the digital imaging portfolio patents in its future businesses, and for those businesses that it is selling.
Cause_General	Kodak is being advised by Lazard and the law firm Sullivan & Cromwell.
Main	Newsweek, the struggling weekly magazine that ceased print publication last year, plans to turn the presses back on.
Main	The magazine will begin a 64-page, weekly edition in January or February, said Jim Impoco, Newsweek’s editor in chief.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He said in an interview that Newsweek would depend more heavily on subscribers than advertisers to pay its bills and that readers would pay more for Newsweek than in the past.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“It’s going to be a more subscription-based model, closer to what The Economist is, compared to what Time magazine is,” Impoco said.
Distant_Evaluation	“We see it as a premium product, a boutique product.”
Distant_Evaluation	Newsweek’s return to print is a positive sign for a magazine that struggled mightily in the digital age.
Distant_Historical	At its height in 1991, the magazine had 3.3 million readers.
Distant_Historical	In 2010, Newsweek’s owner, The Washington Post, sold it to billionaire investor Sidney Harman for $1.
Distant_Historical	Harman, who also assumed $40 million in liabilities, then merged it with The Daily Beast, the website owned by IAC/InterActiveCorp.
Distant_Historical	Editor Tina Brown took control of the combined titles, but the venture failed.
Distant_Evaluation	The traditional Newsweek never properly blended with The Daily Beast.
Distant_Historical	Brown announced in October 2012 that Newsweek would no longer publish a magazine, saving $40 million a year, and would continue as an online-only magazine called Newsweek Global.
Distant_Evaluation	Still, removing those print costs did not mean Newsweek had found a solution.
Distant_Historical	In May, Brown announced that IAC/InterActiveCorp planned to sell Newsweek, so that the company could focus its attention on The Daily Beast.
Distant_Historical	IBT Media - a small, digital media company - bought Newsweek in August.
Distant_Historical	In September, Brown stepped down from The Daily Beast and said she was leaving publishing entirely.
Distant_Evaluation	Impoco, who became Newsweek’s editor in September, said that the magazine’s new owner would not have to spend as much money publishing it as the previous owner.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Impoco said that IBT was negotiating with printers and distributors and hoped to build Newsweek’s circulation to 100,000 in the first year.
Cause_General	Since taking the helm, Impoco, a former editor at The New York Times, has made more than two dozen new hires and is looking to expand Newsweek’s international coverage.
Main	DAKAR, Senegal - Charles Blé Goudé, a crucial ally of Laurent Gbagbo, the Ivory Coast strongman indicted on charges of crimes against humanity, is being sought on similar charges, the International Criminal Court said Tuesday.
Distant_Historical	Blé Goudé played a central role in Gbagbo’s efforts to stay in power by force after his defeat in presidential elections in November 2010, recruiting and arming youths who went on to beat and sometimes murder opponents in the economic capital, Abidjan.
Distant_Evaluation	He was known as the “general of the streets,” and the youth militia he founded, the Jeunes Patriotes, or Young Patriots, was notorious for its brutality, extortionate checkpoints and frenzied rallies presided over by Blé Goudé.
Cause_Specific	An indictment against him, unsealed Tuesday by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, has been pending since December 2011, eight months after he fled Ivory Coast when Gbagbo, the former president, was ousted by the French military.
Distant_Historical	Blé Goudé was subsequently arrested in Ghana and extradited to Ivory Coast in January of this year.
Cause_General	The indictment accuses him of crimes of humanity including murder and rape and calls him a member of Gbagbo’s inner circle who met with him to receive instructions and formulate plans, playing “a key role in recruiting, enlisting, arming, training and integrating thousands of volunteers” into the army.
Distant_Evaluation	The wounds of the brief but bloody 2010-11 civil war - more than 3,000 people died - in Ivory Coast, in which Blé Goudé participated actively, are not healed.
Distant_Historical	Rural warlords who helped bring Gbagbo’s presidential opponent, Alassane Ouattara, to power still play important military and economic roles, notably in smuggling and in other “predatory economic activities,” according to a report by a United Nations group of experts in April that underlined the country’s political fragility.
Distant_Historical	Gbagbo’s partisans remain armed; about $400 million in cocoa beans - Ivory Coast is the world’s leading producer and was once West Africa’s economic powerhouse - was lost to smuggling in 2011-12, according to the report.
Distant_Historical	Long before the civil war, the Jeunes Patriotes had several times been mobilized against forces perceived to be threatening Gbagbo’s power, including the French and the United Nations, with violent results.
Cause_General	Blé Goudé is now being held by the authorities in Ivory Coast, and it is not clear whether they will release him to The Hague.
Cause_Specific	Eleven days ago they announced that they would not be sending Gbagbo’s wife, Simone, also under indictment, to The Hague, but instead would try her at home.
Distant_Evaluation	Human rights activists in Ivory Coast said they doubted that Blé Goudé could receive a fair trial in that country, pointing out, for instance, that his lawyer there has no access to him.
Cause_General	In addition, some of the very rebel leaders who helped Ouattara gain power are accused of crimes similar to those Gbagbo and his associates are accused of.
Cause_General	But so far they have not been arrested.
Distant_Evaluation	“We think justice in Ivory Coast is victors’ justice,” said Hervé Gouamene, Blé Goudé’s lawyer in Abidjan.
Distant_Evaluation	“Everyone knows crimes were committed on the other side, too.
Distant_Evaluation	There is no impartiality.”
Main	SEOUL, South Korea – North Korea said Thursday that its Supreme Court had sentenced a U.S. citizen to 15 years of hard labor for committing hostile acts against its government.
Cause_Specific	Kenneth Bae, 44, a Korean-American from Washington state who ran a tour business out of China, was arrested in the special economic zone of Rason in northeastern North Korea in November after leading a group of businessmen there from Yanji, China.
Cause_General	On Saturday, the North said it was indicting him on charges that he tried to overthrow Pyongyang’s government.
Main	On Thursday, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said the Supreme Court had sentenced Bae during a hearing Tuesday.
Cause_General	The court convicted him of “hostile acts,” a charge less grave than the original charge that prosecutors pressed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The crime of trying to overthrow the government could have resulted in the death penalty.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Under North Korean law, Bae should be transferred to a labor camp within 10 days of the ruling.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The ruling came amid high tensions between Pyongyang and Washington and could complicate Washington’s diplomatic balancing act as it tries to hold a tough line with North Korea over its nuclear program.
Distant_Evaluation	South Korean human rights advocates have said Bae not only ran tours to North Korea but also was interested in helping orphans there.
Distant_Evaluation	They said security officials in the North might have been offended by pictures of orphans that Bae had taken and stored in his computer.
Distant_Evaluation	North Korea has often used the plight of detained Americans as a bargaining chip in its dealings with Washington.
Distant_Historical	Some were freed only after former U.S. presidents traveled to the North to seek their release.
Distant_Historical	In 2009, North Korea arrested two U.S. journalists, Laura Ling and Euna Lee, who it said had entered illegally and committed “hostile acts.” They were sentenced to 12 years of hard labor, but were released five months later, after former President Bill Clinton visited Pyongyang, the North’s capital, and met with Kim Jong Il, the leader at the time.
Cause_General	The North has been locked in a standoff with the United States and South Korea since detonating a nuclear bomb in February.
Distant_Evaluation	Some analysts say the nation’s leader, Kim Jong Un, might be chafing at his inability to shift those two countries, which have refused to offer the North aid in order to relieve tensions, from their tough stance.
Distant_Historical	In January, Bill Richardson, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, tried to see Bae during a private trip to the North, but he said the government had rebuffed him.

Main	MEXICO CITY - A former Mexican governor was sentenced Friday to nearly 11 years in prison in the United States after pleading guilty in New York to a federal charge of conspiring to launder millions of dollars in drug cartel bribes to allow cocaine to move freely through his state.
Distant_Historical	Shortly after becoming the governor of Quintana Roo state - popular for its vacation resort Cancún - in 1993, Mario Villanueva Madrid, 65, made the kind of deal U.S. law-enforcement officials have suspected local officials of making more often than they are able to prove.
Distant_Historical	Prosecutors said Villanueva had agreed to let the Juárez cartel, then one of the largest and most powerful, to transport cocaine from Colombia through Quintana Roo and on to the United States in exchange for up to $500,000 per shipment.
Distant_Historical	Traffickers were free to unload drug shipments at a state government hangar of a local airport, Mexican authorities have said.
Distant_Historical	Villanueva - nicknamed El Chueco, or “the Crooked One” - spread his capital through banks in the United States, Switzerland and the Bahamas.
Distant_Historical	Mexican authorities first began investigating Villanueva while he was governor.
Distant_Historical	Days before his term ended in 1999, he disappeared, but was caught two years later in Cancún, where he was convicted on organized crime and corruption offenses, imprisoned and then extradited in 2010 to the United States, which had indicted him in 2001.
Cause_General	Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said he had more than $17 million in a number of U.S. accounts that had been seized, including one at Lehman Bros.
Cause_Specific	Villanueva pleaded guilty to the federal count in August.
Distant_Evaluation	“With his sentence today, Villanueva Madrid completes his descent from elected government official to corrupted official to incarcerated felon,” said Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan.
Cause_General	Villanueva is the latest in a growing list of former Mexican governors making headlines over corruption allegations.
Cause_General	Andrés Granier, who until December was the governor of Tabasco state, was arrested this week on suspicion of embezzling millions of dollars in state funds.
Cause_General	A former governor of Aguascalientes state, Luis Armando Reynoso Femat, is being investigated for malfeasance.
Main	Kathryn Wasserman Davis, who contributed tens of millions of dollars to cleaning the Hudson River and promoting peace through an organization she founded when she was 100, died Tuesday at her home in Hobe Sound, Fla. She was 106.
Main	Her death was confirmed by her grandson Christopher Davis.
Cause_General	Davis donated millions to Scenic Hudson, a group that works to clean the river and its environs, after taking up kayaking in her 90s near her home in Tarrytown, N.Y.
Distant_Historical	In 2007, when she turned 100, she founded Davis Projects for Peace, which awards $10,000 grants to humanitarian endeavors around the world initiated by college students.
Cause_General	About 600 proposals from students of the 90 schools associated with the Davis United World College Scholars Program have been financed so far.
Cause_General	This year’s projects include an attempt to provide solar-powered lamps to an impoverished county in China.
Cause_General	For her efforts Davis was awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service.
Cause_General	Davis was also a benefactor of higher education, giving to Ivy League universities such as Harvard and Columbia and particularly to Wellesley College, her undergraduate alma mater, where she created the Davis Museum and Cultural Center.
Distant_Historical	Kathryn Stix Wasserman was born in Philadelphia on Feb. 25, 1907.
Cause_General	She received a bachelor’s degree from Wellesley, in Massachusetts, a master’s in international relations from Columbia University and a doctorate from the University of Geneva in Switzerland.
Distant_Historical	A lifelong globetrotter and a Russophile since her first visit to the Caucasus Mountains in 1929, she met the insurance investment magnate Shelby Cullom Davis on a train to Geneva in 1930.
Distant_Historical	They were married on Jan. 4, 1932.
Distant_Historical	Shelby Davis died in 1994.
Cause_General	Davis is survived by a daughter, Diana Davis Spencer; a son, Shelby; eight grandchildren; and 11 great-grandchildren.
Cause_General	She also owned a home in Northeast Harbor, Maine, and supported environmental charities there including the Maine Coast Heritage Trust.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Her grandson Christopher said that virtually all of the Davis fortune would be left to charity.
Main	MOSCOW – Aleksei A. Navalny, the opposition leader and one of the most prominent politicians to go on trial in modern Russia, used his first full day in court Wednesday to say that the trial would prove his innocence, even if the judge convicted him.
Distant_Evaluation	The trial, streamed on the Internet, has promised to be an important touchstone in President Vladimir V. Putin’s long career, as prosecutors have not previously indicted a high-profile politician, but it has gotten off to a languid start.
Cause_General	It began last week in the provincial city of Kirov, east of Moscow.
Cause_General	Within an hour of opening, however, Judge Sergei A. Blinov granted a request by the defense lawyers for an adjournment so they could better prepare for trial.
Cause_General	They requested a month, he gave them a week and they appealed.
Cause_General	A higher court rejected that appeal Tuesday, clearing the way for opening statements to begin Wednesday.
Cause_General	Navalny, who is a lawyer, spoke at times in his own defense.
Main	“I am certain my innocence will be clear to everybody who is present in this chamber and everybody watching,” Navalny told the court, according to a transcript posted by the Rapsi legal news agency.
Distant_Evaluation	“To all those involved in the illegal investigation, sooner or later you will face a severe but just punishment.”
Cause_General	Others who have challenged Putin have faced prosecution, most notably the Yukos oil tycoon, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who remains in prison, but the case against Navalny is the first in post-Soviet Russia against a high-profile political figure.
Cause_Specific	Navalny is charged with embezzling $500,000 from a state-controlled timber company in Kirov while working as an adviser to the regional governor in 2009.
Cause_Specific	Prosecutors initially dismissed the case, but federal officials revived it after Navalny became the most prominent leader of the street protests in Moscow last year.
Cause_General	He used his first day in court for a flurry of motions seemingly intended to highlight the apparent absurdity of a 4-year-old case in a provincial city far from Moscow surfacing in the wake of last winter’s protests, but ostensibly unrelated to the street protests.
Distant_Evaluation	A spokesman for the Investigative Committee, a branch of the prosecutor’s office, said in an interview in Izvestia newspaper that investigators had focused on Navalny because he was accusing state officials of corruption while claiming to be “clean” himself.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The trial will resume Thursday.
Main	MEXICO CITY – Guatemala’s highest court on Monday threw out the genocide conviction and prison sentence of the former dictator Gen. Efrain Rios Montt, ruling to rewind the trial to its final days.
Distant_Evaluation	The decision by Guatemala’s Constitutional Court is a dramatic legal victory for Rios Montt, 86, and a blow to human rights advocates who called his conviction a sign that Guatemala’s courts would no longer allow impunity for the country’s powerful.
Cause_General	Rios Montt was sent to prison immediately after the verdict on May 10 but was transferred to a military hospital three days later for medical tests.
Main_Consequence	The decision means that he will return to house arrest, where he had been held since the case against him began in January 2012.
Cause_General	A three-panel tribunal found him guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity, and he was sentenced to 80 years in prison.
Cause_General	But Monday’s ruling did not throw out the entire trial.
Cause_Specific	Instead, it rolled back the proceedings to April 19, when a complex decision by a pretrial judge sent the trial into disarray.
Cause_Specific	The Constitutional Court issued several confusing rulings that the trial judges interpreted to allow them to continue the proceedings.
Distant_Evaluation	Legal experts said it was unlikely that the final days of the trial would be repeated because that would amount to a form of double jeopardy for the former dictator.
Cause_General	Rios Montt was found to be responsible for a series of massacres and rapes and the forced displacement of the Maya-Ixil ethnic group during his 17-month rule in 1982 and 1983.
Cause_General	During a month of prosecution testimony, the court heard wrenching descriptions by survivors of the army’s scorched-earth policy through the hamlets of the Mayan highlands.
Cause_General	His co-defendant, Gen. Jose Mauricio Rodriguez Sanchez, was acquitted.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The constitutional court’s ruling effectively throws out his acquittal, and it is unclear whether he will be rearrested.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The attorney general’s office is expected to appeal the court’s 3-2 ruling on Tuesday.
Distant_Evaluation	Although the verdict was celebrated by international human rights organizations, it was controversial in Guatemala.
Cause_General	The Constitutional Court was the target of a lobbying campaign by opponents of the verdict as it considered several defense injunctions it had failed to rule on during the trial.
Distant_Evaluation	Perhaps the most important campaign was by Guatemala’s powerful business federation, known as Cacif for the initials of its Spanish name.
Distant_Evaluation	Representing the country’s deeply conservative oligarchy, Cacif urged the court to overturn the verdict.
Distant_Evaluation	The court “has the power in its hands to contribute to the governability and assure an effective rule of law,” the business group said.
Main	A 21-year-old college student was shot and killed early Friday on Long Island after an armed man broke into the home she shared with her twin sister, held her hostage and then engaged in a gunbattle with police, authorities said.
Cause_General	The man who forced his way into the home was also killed.
Distant_Evaluation	It was not immediately clear who fired the fatal shots, police said.
Cause_General	The violence played out in the middle of the night on an ordinarily quiet residential street, only blocks from Hofstra University, where the victim went to school.
Cause_General	Students who were preparing for their last day of exams awoke to the news that one of their own had been killed.
Cause_General	The victim, Andrea Rebello, was a junior from Tarrytown, N.Y., and was studying public relations.
Cause_General	She shared the home with her twin, Jessica, and another young woman, according to the police.
Cause_General	A young man was also staying at the house at the time.
Cause_General	The suspect, who was not identified, knocked on the door of the home around 2:15 a.m., and when one of the residents looked to see who was there, he burst in, according to police.
Cause_General	He was wearing a ski mask and carrying a pistol, police said.
Cause_General	He held the twin sisters and the young man hostage but let the other woman leave, police said.
Cause_General	That woman took the opportunity to call 911.
Cause_General	“Shortly after our arrival, a shooting took place where the suspect is killed and one of the female victims are killed,” said Deputy Inspector Kenneth Lack of the Nassau County Police Department.
Cause_General	The details of the shooting were still under investigation, the police said, but it appeared that the gunman and the police exchanged gunfire.
Main_Consequence	The university sent a text message to students Friday alerting them to the shooting, but providing few details.
Main_Consequence	Hofstra’s president, Stuart Rabinowitz, issued a statement later in the day confirming that a student had been killed.
Cause_General	University officials said commencement ceremonies would go on as scheduled this weekend.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Students were planning to gather on campus, where the flags were flown at half-staff, on Friday evening to remember Andrea Rebello.

Main	Eluding frenzied Czech media, the disgraced former prime minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Necas, and his onetime chief of staff were married in a secret ceremony Saturday, the Czech media reported Tuesday.
Distant_Evaluation	With the couple ensnared in the most exhaustive anticorruption sting operation in the Czech Republic since the fall of Communism, their marriage was variously viewed by analysts as a misguided love story or a cynical ploy to avoid prosecution.
Distant_Historical	In June, Necas, 48, once nicknamed “Mr.
Distant_Historical	Clean Hands” for his anticorruption campaigning, was forced to resign after his chief of staff and mistress, Jana Nagyova, was charged with abuse of office for using the country’s secret intelligence service to spy on Necas’ wife, whom he divorced in August.
Distant_Historical	Nagyova was also accused of trying to bribe three members of Parliament, who opposed a government austerity plan, with offers of posts in state-owned companies.
Cause_General	Prosecutors have been seeking to prove that Necas, a churchgoing father of four, was also involved in bribing members of Parliament.
Distant_Evaluation	But Tuesday, Nagyova dealt prosecutors a blow when she walked into a police station in Prague and introduced herself as Mrs. Jana Necasova, her lawyer, Eduard Bruna, told the Czech media.
Distant_Evaluation	Under Czech law, family members cannot be compelled to testify against one another, and analysts said this could make it difficult for prosecutors to prove that any order to offer bribes came from the former prime minister.
Distant_Evaluation	“The heart of the bribery case has been whether she was acting alone or on behalf of Mr. Necas, and now it will be very difficult to prove whether he was giving her directions,” said Jaroslav Plesl, deputy editor of Tyden, a leading political magazine.
Cause_General	Speculation that Necas and Nagyova married in a secret ceremony had been building for days, after they were spotted at Chateau Mcely, a 17th-century chateau near Prague with a manicured English park, a spa and a lake with a white sand beach.
Cause_General	Tabloids have been offering big rewards for recent photographs or videos of the couple.
Distant_Evaluation	The two had been engaged for years in a surreptitious relationship that Necas finally acknowledged in July, telling Tyden that being romantically involved with a senior aide while he was prime minister was probably a bad idea.
Distant_Evaluation	“Interconnecting a personal relationship with a working relationship is simply not correct, and I knew that,” he told the magazine, explaining that the heart had won out over the head.
Cause_General	Necas has not been charged with a crime and has denied any wrongdoing.
Cause_General	Nagyova has also professed her innocence and was released in July after a month in jail pending trial.
Cause_General	On Tuesday, Bruna, her lawyer, told the Czech media that Nagyova had declined to give a statement to the police, saying she was “not yet ready.”
Distant_Evaluation	The inquiry, which included wiretaps of Necas’ phone calls with Nagyova, turned up $8 million in cash and stashes of gold that prosecutors suspect was linked to influence peddling, the authorities said.
Distant_Historical	When Nagyova’s home was searched in June before her arrest, the police discovered receipts for Louis Vuitton handbags totaling 120,000 euros, about $162,000.
Distant_Evaluation	But it is unclear whether they were gifts or merely the accessories of a woman referred to as “tsarina” because of her luxurious tastes.
Distant_Evaluation	The case has riveted the country in a region that has struggled to shed a culture of corruption in the aftermath of the Communist era.
Distant_Anecdotal	Corruption in the Czech Republic is so endemic that one industrious young Czech recently started a “crony safari” bus tour.
Distant_Anecdotal	The stops include the modernist villas of influential lobbyists and a single address registered to hundreds of companies.
Main	ALBANY – In another setback for proponents of the natural gas drilling technique known as hydrofracking, a state appellate court affirmed the right of local governments to ban the process within their borders.
Main	In a 4-0 decision Thursday, the Appellate Division of state Supreme Court’s Third Department rejected an appeal from Norse Energy Corporation, which had stepped into the plaintiff’s role in a lawsuit initially brought by Anschutz Exploration Corp. against the Town of Dryden’s fracking ban.
Distant_Historical	When the ban was passed in August 2011, Anschutz had approximately 22,000 acres of land in the Tompkins County community under lease for potential drilling.
Distant_Historical	Norse, a Norwegian company that subsequently acquired many of the leases, entered bankruptcy court in December.
Cause_General	New York has not made a final decision on fracking despite a regulatory process that has lasted more than four years.
Cause_General	Gov.
Cause_General	Andrew Cuomo is awaiting the final construction of the Department of Environmental Conservation’s regulatory framework for the process.
Cause_General	A key chapter of the massive document is awaiting review by the Department of Health.
Cause_General	The technique, used in Pennsylvania, Texas and many other states, involves the injection of high volumes of water and a small amount of chemicals to break up gas-bearing shale deposits.
Distant_Evaluation	The drilling industry insists the process is safe, but opposition to fracking has virtually eclipsed every other environmental issue in New York in recent years.
Distant_Evaluation	The plaintiffs in the Dryden case argued the ban violates the state’s regulatory supremacy under the Oil, Gas and Solution Mining Law.
Main_Consequence	Thursday’s decision affirmed a February 2012 decision in state Supreme Court that rejected the industry’s argument.
Distant_Evaluation	''We find nothing in the language, statutory scheme or legislative history of the (Mining Law) statute indicating an intention to usurp the authority traditionally delegated to municipalities to establish permissible and prohibited uses of land within their jurisdictions,'' wrote Appellate Division Presiding Justice Karen Peters.
Distant_Evaluation	The mid-level appeals court decision held ''that the OGSML does not pre-empt ... a municipality’s power to enact a local zoning ordinance banning all activities related to the exploration for, and the production or storage of, natural gas and petroleum within its borders.''
Distant_Evaluation	Justices Leslie Stein, Edward Spain and Elizabeth Garry concurred.
Cause_General	The same decision informed the court’s rejection of an appeal from a landowner who opposed a ban in Middlefield, Otsego County.
Cause_General	According to the website FrackTracker, there are 55 municipal bans against fracking in New York state – including those in Albany and Guilderland – and 105 moratoriums.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Activists believe many of the moratoriums could harden into bans now that communities won’t have to face the costly prospect of defending themselves in court.
Distant_Evaluation	''We’re obviously disappointed with the decision,'' said Albany attorney Thomas West, who represented Norse in the Dryden appeal.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He noted that since the decision isn’t a reversal of a lower court decision and absent at least two dissenting justices, it’s highly unlikely the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, will agree to hear the case.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Nevertheless, he said the plaintiffs plan to ask the Albany-based court to take the case.
Distant_Evaluation	''It’s another nail in the coffin for drilling in New York,'' West said, adding that energy companies aren’t going to plunge resources into securing drilling rights on land that can be swept out from under them by ''a 3-2 town board vote.''
Distant_Evaluation	Anti-fracking groups were elated.
Distant_Evaluation	''This decision shows that our democracy in New York state still works and in this David and Goliath battle we can win,'' said a statement from Kelly Branigan of Middlefield Neighbors and New Yorkers Against Fracking.
Distant_Anecdotal	But James Pardo, a New York City attorney who has represented the oil and gas industry, said the decision could potentially have the effect of smoothing fracking’s path in New York.
Distant_Anecdotal	Pardo noted Cuomo, who will make the ultimate decision on whether the state will allow the process, has reportedly explored a pilot program that would let communities decide if they want to welcome fracking.
Distant_Anecdotal	The appellate court’s decision, which in effect imposes that home-rule mechanism statewide, provides ''the ultimate out for him,'' Pardo said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''Now he can say ... 'If you don’t want it going on in your community, amend your zoning ordinance.'''
Distant_Anecdotal	For drilling companies, he said the ruling ''will take the fight local.
Distant_Anecdotal	...
Distant_Anecdotal	It will force operators to get down in the weeds in these communities’' and make their case for development.
Distant_Evaluation	Environmentalists who believe fracking is inherently unsafe say only a statewide ban will suffice.
Distant_Evaluation	''The kind of environmental degradation that occurs with fracking knows no boundaries on a map,'' said Seth Gladstone of Food & Water Watch.

Cause_Specific	(Reuters) - British industrial distribution company Electrocomponents (ECM.L) is looking at Germany and the United States for potential bolt-on acquisitions and views China as one of its “greatest investment opportunities” over the next five years.
Main	Electrocomponents made its first acquisition in nearly two decades with its 88 million pound ($114.2 million) purchase of IESA and CEO Lindsley Ruth has now set his sights on gaining increased penetration in the United States and Germany.
Distant_Evaluation	“They’re two of the biggest markets in the world for the products that we sell,” Ruth told Reuters on Thursday after the company gave an upbeat results outlook.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The company, which owns the RS Components, IESA and Allied Electronics & Automation brands, forecast a 27 percent jump in half-year adjusted pretax profit led by strong sales in its RS Pro business.
Cause_General	Ruth’s turnaround plan since taking the helm in 2015 has propelled the company’s share price to levels last seen around the dot-com bubble, having plunged by 87 percent to 113 pence in 2009.
Cause_General	The shares were up 3.2 percent at 741.4 pence at 1056 GMT on Thursday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Electrocomponents has been cutting costs and simplifying its structure, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, and finance chief David Egan said it plans to invest in both digital and customer acquisitions in the region.
Cause_General	“The investment is across Asia-Pacific, but with an emphasis on China,” he told Reuters.
Cause_General	The company has been beefing up RS Pro, its high-margin electric and automation tools business, and said the unit outperformed the group in the half year to Sept. 30, with like-for-like revenue growth of 12 percent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The FTSE 250 company said it was on track to deliver 4 million pounds of cost savings in the current financial year.
Cause_General	Ruth, whose efforts have brought a threefold increase in like-for-like revenue and saw its Asia-Pacific operations return to profit in the second half of last year, said that the second phase of the turnaround process was almost complete.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We are quite happy with where we are, but we are still not where we need to be,” Ruth said, adding that there is significant room for improvement, especially in China.

Main	BEIJING, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- China will raise the retail prices of gasoline and diesel starting Friday, the country's top economic planner said Thursday.
Main	Based on changes in international oil prices, the retail prices of both gasoline and diesel will be raised by 50 yuan (about 7.4 U.S. dollars) per tonne, according to the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).
Cause_General	Under the current pricing mechanism, if international crude oil prices change by more than 50 yuan per tonne and remain at that level for 10 working days, the prices of refined oil products such as gasoline and diesel in China will be adjusted accordingly.
Cause_General	The NDRC has demanded that major oil companies, including China National Petroleum Corporation, China Petrochemical Corporation and China National Offshore Oil Corporation, should work to ensure stable supply and implement the pricing policy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The economic planner said it would closely monitor the effects of the current pricing mechanism and make improvements in response to global fluctuations.

Main	Food prices were up 0.8 percent in the year to January 2019, mainly driven by higher prices for ready-to-eat food, milk, cheese and eggs and restaurant meals, partly offset by lower fruit prices, which was down 5.8 percent, statistics showed.
Cause_General	Broccoli prices more than doubled in January 2019, while lettuce prices rose almost 80 percent.
Cause_General	The average price of a 350g head of broccoli was 2.76 NZ dollars (1.88 U.S. dollars) in January, up from a near seven-year low of 1.25 NZ dollars in December.

Distant_Evaluation	“We continue to believe that it is in the best interests of all our stakeholders to accomplish this as a going concern, rather than alternatives that could result in significant reductions in value.”
Cause_General	Sears is working to transform its business by selling brands like tool line Craftsman and building a stronger online presence.
Distant_Evaluation	Its market share has been hurt by discount chains including Walmart (WMT.N), and the surge in popularity of online shopping has added to its woes.
Cause_General	It was the second time in two years that Sears has expressed doubt about its business continuing as its losses mount.
Distant_Evaluation	“This year’s statement regarding its ability to remain a going concern is more dire,” Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics Inc. “It has liquidated its best assets and the cupboard is bare.
Distant_Evaluation	These losses are unsustainable.”
Cause_General	Sears declined to comment.
Main	Sales at Sears’ established stores, including Kmart discount shops, fell 3.9 percent in its second quarter, compared with a drop of 11.9 percent in the first quarter, a positive sign sending the 125-year-old retailer’s shares up 28 percent in extended trading.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Sears has closed hundreds of underperforming stores so its same-store sales should be much better than they have been as only their ‘stronger’ performing stores are in the mix,” said Perkins.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Sears said 149 stores will close in the second half of this year.
Cause_General	The company’s net loss widened to $508 million in the fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 4, from $250 million a year before.
Cause_General	To shore up its finances, the company is considering selling its storied Kenmore appliance brand and home improvement business to Lampert’s hedge fund, ESL Investments Inc, for as much as $480 million.
Cause_General	Last month, Lampert said he could close on a deal for the businesses with an unnamed partner by late August.
Cause_General	Sears’ special committee and a majority of disinterested shareholders must approve the sale to ESL.
Cause_General	The company has tried to sell these assets before without success.
Distant_Evaluation	The company said that some of its efforts to raise cash, including the sale of Kenmore and its home improvement business to Lampert, were at too early a stage to be counted for its quarterly earnings released on Thursday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, it said if it finalizes its plans to bolster liquidity, and completes discussions with lenders, it will be able to remain in business.
Cause_General	Sears’ stock, which traded at about $100 a share more than a decade ago, closed down 9 percent at $1.21 while investors awaited the results, which had been expected to be released earlier on Thursday.

Main	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Allergan Plc (AGN.N) said revenue from its medical aesthetics business could double by 2025, even as it faces increasing competition for its blockbuster wrinkle treatment, Botox.
Cause_General	The drugmaker announced earlier on Friday the acquisition of Bonti Inc, which makes a shorter-acting neurotoxin than Botox.
Cause_General	Allergan is also doubling its investment in direct-to-consumer ad spending and beefing up its sales force as companies like Revance Therapeutics Inc (RVNC.O) and Evolus Inc (EOLS.O) vie to wrest market share with rival treatments to Botox.
Cause_General	The company made the announcements at its Medical Aesthetics Day in New York.
Main	Chief Commercial Officer Bill Meury said Allergan expects revenue at its medical aesthetics unit to grow to $7 billion to $8 billion.
Distant_Historical	That compares with revenue of $3.8 billion from the business in 2017.
Cause_General	Beyond Botox, the unit includes dermal filler Juvederm, the CoolSculpting fat-freezing systems, and other treatments.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He said the forecast implied an 8 to 10 percent compound annual growth rate.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Meury said the Bonti acquisition would allow the company to market a new “starter toxin.” Patients could test drive the treatment, which lasts for two to four weeks, to help them decide if they want to use longer-term Botox.

Main	“Elon Musk’s erratic behavior suggests that he sees it the same way.”
Cause_General	Greenlight’s letter came one day after Musk, a longtime critic of short-sellers, appeared to taunt the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by calling it the “Shortseller Enrichment Commission” on Twitter.
Cause_General	That came just five days after Musk settled SEC fraud charges, in an accord that lets him remain Tesla’s chief executive but requires he step aside as chairman.
Cause_General	A judge has yet to approve the settlement.
Cause_General	Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Cause_General	Its shares were down 7 percent at $262.05 in late afternoon trading.
Cause_General	Greenlight is having a difficult year, with its main fund down 25.7 percent through September, but said its Tesla short position was its second biggest winner in the third quarter.
Distant_Historical	In an investor presentation in May 2008, four months before Lehman went bankrupt, Einhorn had questioned the investment bank’s accounting, including for real estate, and said it needed to raise large amounts of capital.
Main	Einhorn said Tesla has “many parallels” to Lehman, which he said “threatened short sellers, refused to raise capital (it even bought back stock), and management publicly suggested it would go private.”
Main	“Months later, shareholders, creditors, employees and the global economy paid a big price when management’s reckless behavior led to bankruptcy,” Einhorn said.
Main	He said a big problem for Musk is that Tesla would lose too much money targeting a mass audience by selling its Model 3 at a $35,000 starting price, and yet “can’t bring himself” to cancel the program and refund customer deposits.
Main	“His conduct suggests that he is doing his best to be relieved of his position as CEO to avoid accountability,” Einhorn said.
Distant_Historical	Musk, for his part, has used Twitter to mock Einhorn, saying on Aug. 1 he would “send Einhorn a box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time.”
Distant_Historical	Greenlight said it also sold its last Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares in August at $228 per share, eight years after buying the iPhone maker at less than one-sixth that price, on growing fear of “Chinese retaliation against America’s trade policies.

Main	NEW HAVEN, the United States, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Trump administration's punitive tariff plan against China is politically biased and makes untrue charges, a U.S. expert has said.
Main	"""It's more political noise than a genuine strategy,"" Stephen Roach, former chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia and senior fellow at Yale University's Jackson Institute for Global Affairs, told Xinhua in an interview."
Distant_Evaluation	"The American economist said the so-called ""Special 301 Report on Intellectual Property Rights"" is wide of the mark in some key areas."
Cause_General	Section 301 is a measure under the U.S. Trade Act of 1974 that allows the president to take action, including retaliation, if an investigation finds foreign trade practices are burdening or restricting U.S. commerce or are unreasonable or discriminatory.
Cause_General	On March 22, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum that could impose tariffs on up to 60 billion U.S. dollars of imports from China and restrict Chinese investment in the United States.
Distant_Evaluation	UNTRUE ACCUSATIONS
Cause_General	"The report by the U.S. Trade Representative accuses China of ""forced technology transfer"" in joint ventures."
Cause_General	It says U.S. companies have to turn over proprietary technologies and operating systems in order to do business in China.
Distant_Evaluation	"""I don't think that's true,"" Roach said, drawing on his experience when he worked for Morgan Stanley in a joint venture with China Construction Bank."
Distant_Historical	During their tie-up to build China's first investment bank in 1995, the U.S. partner shared its business practices and distribution system.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This was a conscious effort on our part to share,"" Roach said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""We did it voluntarily,"" pointing out that U.S. and other multinational corporations willingly enter into these legally-negotiated arrangements for commercially sound reasons."
Cause_General	"The report also accuses China of being the only country to develop a plan like ""Made in China 2025"" for growing its hi-tech industries."
Distant_Evaluation	According to Roach's research, many countries have been engaged in building strong industries, including Japan, Germany and the United States itself.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It's really hypocritical for the U.S. to criticize China for utilizing industrial policies,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	LOSE-LOSE TRADE WAR
Distant_Evaluation	The punitive U.S. tariff plan targeting China is regarded by many as a unilateral move that poses a threat to global trade.
Distant_Evaluation	It is consistent with the long-standing tendency to blame trade deficits for loss of manufacturing jobs at home.
Distant_Evaluation	"""(Trump) thinks China is responsible for many of the problems that continue to prevent America from being great again,"" Roach said, commenting on the real intention behind the measure."
Distant_Evaluation	According to his research, in 2017, the United States had a trade deficit with 102 countries.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We have a multilateral problem,"" the senior economist noted."
Distant_Evaluation	"""It's wrong to look at one or two pieces as evidence of bilateral problems."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Calling the U.S.-China trade dispute a serious issue which, if handled improperly, may intensify the risk of a trade war, he emphasized that ""globalization is being win-win while trade wars are lose-lose."""
Distant_Evaluation	REGULAR EXCHANGES VITAL
Cause_General	Fears of a trade war shook the global stock and currency markets immediately after Trump's announcement on March 22, with the benchmark S&P 500 Index slumping the most since early February and the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping nearly 3 percent.
Cause_General	On March 23, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 Index plunged 4.5 percent to 20,671.11 and South Korea's Kospi tumbled 3.1 percent.
Cause_General	in China, both the Shanghai Composite and Hang Seng lost over 3 percent.
Cause_General	Benchmarks in Southeast Asia and Australia fell too.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Experts say there are many areas for cooperation between the United States and China, but the risks of a trade war would make it very difficult to achieve.
Distant_Evaluation	"""A secretariat that contains experts from both sides to meet and exchange views and analysis on a regular basis is a better way to address the disputes,"" Roach said."

Main	URUMQI, Feb. 15 (Xinhua) -- The cotton cultivation areas under the jurisdiction of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC), an economic and paramilitary organization, reported a record-high production last year, local authorities said Thursday.
Main	Stationed in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the corps reported cotton output of 2.05 million tonnes in 2018, up 20.7 percent year on year, at a press conference.
Cause_General	The output accounted for about 40 percent of the region's total yield and 33.5 percent of the national total, according to the corps.
Distant_Evaluation	Wang Xinnong, director of the corps' statistics bureau, said the strong growth in cotton production can be attributed to favorable weather conditions and preferential policies such as subsidies for cotton growers.
Distant_Evaluation	Thanks to the policies, the base's cotton-growing area expanded 23.1 percent to reach 854,033 hectares last year, Wang said.
Distant_Historical	The XPCC was established in 1954 to facilitate the region's socio-economic development, promote unity among ethnic groups and strengthen national border defense.

Main	BEIJING, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- China increased its official gold reserves for a second straight month in January, the latest data from the People's Bank of China showed.
Main	The country's gold reserves rose slightly to 59.94 million ounces at the end of January from 59.56 million ounces at the end of December 2018, marking a second straight month of increase.
Cause_General	The latest gold purchase by the world's second-largest economy came at a time when global central banks are hoarding the precious metal.
Cause_General	According to the World Gold Council, global gold demand increased 4 percent year on year to 4,345.1 tonnes last year.
Cause_General	The amount of gold bought by central banks reached the highest since 1971, the year when the dollar's peg to bullion was scrapped.
Cause_General	Gold reserves of central banks around the world surged 651.5 tonnes, or 74 percent year on year, in 2018.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As a safe haven hedge, gold will become more attractive in 2019, due to greater market uncertainties and the expansion of protectionist economic policies, according to a forecast from the World Gold Council.

Main	The Malaysian Statistics Department said in a statement that revenue for the fourth quarter last year also grew 8.4 percent year-on-year to 433 billion ringgit, mainly driven by wholesale and retail trade, food and beverages and accommodation.
Cause_General	The sector engaged with 3.7 million persons in 2018, up 2.6 percent from the previous year.

Main	NAIROBI, Oct. 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tourism marketers had laid out plans to regard Africa as a key regional market to grow its tourism business, a senior official said.
Cause_General	Betty Radier, Kenya Tourism Board (KTB) CEO, said on Thursday evening that Nairobi is also partnering with the rest of East Africa to provide a wider offering for travelers from the West African region led by Nigeria.
Cause_General	"""We are actively engaging with travel agents and tour operators in Nigeria to expose them to the diverse tourist offering in Kenya and the rest of East Africa that would be of interest to travelers from Nigeria and the rest of West Africa,"" Radier said on the sidelines of the ongoing Magical Kenya Travel Expo in Nairobi."
Cause_General	Radier said bilateral discussions were ongoing between the tourism ministries of Kenya and Sierra Leone to step up collaboration and travel from Sierra Leone to Kenya.
Cause_General	About 150 tourism buyers and 20 international media personalities are in the country during the 3-day expo, which began on Wednesday.
Distant_Evaluation	Radier has said the expo has enabled Kenya to bring together players in Africa's tourism sector to get a better insight of the diverse and authentic tourism products that Kenya has to offer.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We are encouraged that the expo has over the last eight years grown into the ideal platform for business-to-business meetings between leading African products and top-producing global buyers,"" she said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This, Radier said, serves to ensure continued business growth and development for the tourism industry in Kenya.
Distant_Evaluation	She said the expo which has drawn the participation of travel trade partners from across the continent has helped Kenya to be part of efforts to grow a unified brand for Africa as a destination.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	According to the UN World Tourism Organization, the number of Africa outbound market will reach 62 million by 2030 as the continent gradually emerges not only as a tourism destination but also as a tourist source market.
Cause_General	According to statistics from KTB, Africa is currently Kenya's second biggest source market by region, having contributed 29 percent of total tourist arrivals to Kenya in 2017.
Cause_General	Kenya has stepped up its marketing blitz to woo key source markets in the wake of a decrease in tourist arrivals occasioned by a spate of insecurity brought about by acts of terrorism from al-Shabab and travel advisories issued by countries that provide key source markets.
Cause_General	According to KTB, Uganda is Kenya's top tourism source market in Africa, as it commanded 6.4 percent of arrivals in 2017.
Distant_Historical	There were 61,542 arrivals from Uganda in 2017 up from 51,023 in 2016, according to data from KTB.
Cause_General	Tourism is the second largest source of foreign exchange revenue for Kenya after tea, with the main tourist attractions being photo safaris through national parks and game reserves, though the country has been diversifying to other areas like eco-tourism, conference tourism and cultural tourism.
Main	NEW YORK (Reuters) - Distressed investor Marble Ridge Capital LP said in a letter to Neiman Marcus Group Ltd LLC that the luxury department store company may be in default on its debt after it moved its Mytheresa business into an entity belonging to the retailer’s private equity owners.
Distant_Evaluation	“These recent actions threaten the viability of a storied franchise that includes marquee brands such as Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman,” another luxury department store also owned by the retailer, said Dan Kamensky, managing partner of Marble Ridge, in a statement about the letter, parts of which were made public on Friday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Marble Ridge is working with law firm Brown Rudnick LLP and plans to organize with other creditors to look into the Mytheresa move, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Distant_Historical	The hedge fund last year pursued a similar strategy with Singapore-based Global A&T Electronics Ltd.
Distant_Evaluation	“We believe a more responsible board would have engaged in a strategic review to maximize value for the benefit of all of the company’s stakeholders,” Kamensky said.
Distant_Historical	Buyout firm Ares Management LP and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) acquired Neiman Marcus for $6 billion in 2013, saddling the retailer with about $4.7 billion in debt.
Cause_Specific	Neiman Marcus said on Tuesday it moved the Mytheresa online business to an entity called Neiman Marcus Group Inc, owned by Ares and CPPIB.
Cause_General	“As publicly disclosed, Mytheresa was already an unrestricted, non-guarantor subsidiary not part of our lenders’ collateral and it will remain outside of the collateral,” Neiman Marcus said in a statement.
Cause_General	“This reorganization was expressly permitted by the company’s credit documents.”
Cause_General	Ares and CPPIB did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Main	The transfer may have made the company insolvent, Marble Ridge said in the letter dated Sept. 18 and seen by Reuters.
Cause_General	Marble Ridge owns bonds and a portion of the term loan of Neiman Marcus.
Main	Moving Mytheresa strips “an important and valuable asset away from the creditors of the company and (gifts it) to Ares and CPPIB,” for nothing in return, according to the letter.
Cause_General	Mytheresa’s earnings growth has outpaced Neiman Marcus, its outlet stores Last Call and Bergdorf Goodman online, Thomson Reuters IFR reported in a story this week, citing a JPMorgan analyst report.
Distant_Evaluation	Brick-and-mortar retailers including department stores have been hit hard by the rise in popularity of online shopping, with dozens filing for bankruptcy over the past several years.
Distant_Historical	Reuters reported last year that Neiman Marcus was working with an investment bank to address its debt load.

Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other powerful business groups asked an appeals court on Thursday to not undo AT&T Inc’s (T.N) purchase of movie and TV show maker Time Warner, despite the protests of the Justice Department.
Cause_Specific	The chamber, backed by the National Association of Manufacturers, Business Roundtable and others, argued that stopping the merger would “undermine myriad transactions that generally benefit consumers.”
Distant_Evaluation	The business groups argued that companies had long assumed that if they bought a supplier or distributor — generally called a vertical merger — that the deal would be considered good for the consumer and would be allowed.
Distant_Evaluation	“The vague legal standard that the government ... advocate(s) would cloud the business community’s ability to ascertain whether vertical mergers are lawful, making it more difficult to invest in transactions with enormous potential to lower prices and enhance innovation—all of which benefit a diverse array of customers,” the business groups said in a brief court filing.
Cause_General	The Justice Department lost a lawsuit in district court to prevent AT&T, which owns satellite company DirecTV, from buying Time Warner over concerns that AT&T would seek to raise prices when licensing Time Warner’s news, sports and other programing to DirecTV’s cable and satellite rivals.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	AT&T closed the Time Warner deal in June and has said it would manage Time Warner’s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government’s appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Cause_General	No date has been set for an oral argument.
Distant_Historical	The merger, announced in October 2016, was opposed by President Donald Trump.
Cause_General	The merged company includes CNN, a frequent target of Trump’s ire.
Cause_General	A group of nine state attorneys general asked the court on Wednesday also to let the lower court stand.
Main	American investors, having seen the dollar weaken and foreign stock markets consistently outperform the American market, are putting record amounts of money into overseas securities.
Cause_Specific	Figures released this week by the Treasury Department showed that Americans spent a net $40.3 billion on overseas securities in March, making that the second-heaviest outflow ever, trailing only the $48.7 billion figure for last December.
Cause_General	The accompanying chart shows 12-month totals for such purchases, with smaller charts breaking down stock and bond transactions.
Cause_General	All figures are net, the difference between securities purchased and sold, so negative numbers show when Americans were net sellers.
Cause_Specific	For the 12 months through March, Americans bought a record $277 billion in foreign long-term securities.
Distant_Evaluation	Those purchases pale next to the offsetting purchases of American securities by foreigners, which came to $1.15 trillion over the most recent 12 months.
Distant_Evaluation	Nonetheless, they are important because the United States needs to attract foreign investments to offset the huge trade deficit, which is only starting to decline.
Cause_General	For the 12 months through March, that deficit came to $754 billion.
Distant_Evaluation	With Americans clamoring to buy foreign securities -- not to mention the foreign cars, toys and other goods that make up the trade deficit -- the dollar has lost value, particularly against the euro and the British pound, the two principal currencies whose central banks do not intervene to keep them from rising.
Cause_Specific	The figures show that Americans bought a net $168.9 billion of foreign bonds over the 12-month period.
Distant_Historical	By contrast, for all of 2005 the figure was only $45.1 billion.
Distant_Evaluation	The attraction of foreign stocks has also been strong, but is not at record levels.
Distant_Evaluation	The $108.3 billion purchased during the 12-month period is well below the record of $140 billion, set in the 12 months through last May.
Distant_Evaluation	The popularity of foreign stocks has come as foreign markets consistently have done better than the American one.
Cause_Specific	For the 12 months through April, the Standard & Poor's 500, a prominent index of large American companies, was up 13.1 percent.
Cause_Specific	But the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE index, which covers all developed countries except the United States, rose 17 percent.
Cause_General	It was the 44th consecutive month that the EAFE index has shown a better 12-month performance than the S.&P., matching the record length of a stretch that ended in February 1989, another time of dollar weakness.
Distant_Historical	By contrast, Americans were net sellers of foreign stocks in 1999, a time when the dollar was strong and the American stock market was roaring ahead.
Distant_Historical	For 56 months that ended in August 1999, the S.&P.
Distant_Historical	500 showed better 12-month performance than did the EAFE index.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If Americans keep sending their dollars overseas -- whether to buy socks or stocks -- that could put further pressure on the value of those dollars.

Cause_Specific	The acquisition for an undisclosed price is one of several steps the U.S. company is taking in a global strategy to diversify from its core business of sugary sodas.
Cause_General	Last month it agreed to buy Costa coffee for $5.1 billion, and sources familiar with the matter say it is also bidding for GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) Indian Horlicks nutrition business.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We are still on track to complete the acquisition (of Chi Ltd) by the end of the first quarter of 2019,” Peter Njonjo, president of Coca-Cola’s west Africa business, said on Wednesday.
Cause_Specific	Coca-Cola bought a 40 percent stake in the Nigerian juice and snack producer in January 2016, and said at the time it aimed to increase ownership within three years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Juice sales form a central plank of the U.S. company’s attempt to offer drinks at a range of price points in Nigeria to improve affordability in a country where Njonjo sees high inflation and modest economic growth in the coming year.
Distant_Evaluation	Focusing on smaller bottles and cans is another way the company is trying to woo cash-strapped consumers in Nigeria, which emerged from its first recession in 25 years in 2017 but continues to suffer from sluggish growth and high inflation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Affordability will start becoming a bigger issue in this market than it was in the past.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As a company, that is what we need to factor in as we are thinking about the future of our business in Nigeria,” Njonjo said in an interview.
Distant_Evaluation	He pointed to the introduction of a 30 centilitre bottle of Coke Zero for 60 naira ($0.20), compared with the standard 50 centilitre bottle for 80 naira, as just one example.
Error	Slideshow (2 Images)
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Njonjo said the company’s drive to diversify its product range could also give it more flexibility in a market where unemployment is high and the United Nations estimates most of the population of 190 million lives on less than $2 a day.
Distant_Evaluation	“We realize that in certain pack formats you can only go down so low,” he said in an interview at his office in the commercial capital Lagos.
Distant_Evaluation	“But once you start looking at pouches and still products, like juice and drinking yoghurts, that allows you to start accessing much lower price points.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	DIVERSIFYING
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Njonjo said the purchase of Costa could present a “significant opportunity” in Nigeria, despite the absence of a culture of hot-coffee drinking there.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“There definitely could be opportunity around ready-to-drink coffee here in Nigeria ... Having iced coffee, blends of dairy and coffee, packaged in different formats,” he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Njonjo said Horlicks, a malt-based hot beverage, was an “interesting proposition” that could be “a significant opportunity on the (African) continent”.
Distant_Evaluation	But while the company was researching drinks from locally relevant ingredients, such as ginger, he said he could not see a market for marijuana drinks - something the company has said it was closely watching in the past.
Distant_Historical	In January, Coca-Cola announced a global goal to help collect and recycle its packaging.
Cause_General	Njonjo said the company was working in Nigeria to collect bottles and find a way for them to be re-used through a partnership with cement-maker Lafarge in which bottles would be burned in kilns as an energy source.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A memorandum of understanding was being formalized and would be signed in the next few weeks, he said, adding that implementation would begin in the last quarter of this year.
Cause_General	He said the company was also working with Lagos state government on marine collection to remove waste from waterways in the city, which is built on a lagoon.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Emmanuel Macron called on government and business leaders to invest more in slowing down climate change as he opened the second annual “One Planet” summit in New York.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We have to shift one third of the global financing to financing of climate change and new climate action,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“So governments, the World Bank, all the development banks, business leaders and investors, it is our job.
Distant_Evaluation	Everybody is waiting for us and everybody today wants us just to accelerate.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said it would help structure a climate fund for investment in green sectors such as renewable energy and low-carbon transportation across Latin America, Asia, and Africa.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The French and German governments and large philanthropic organizations including The Hewlett Foundation have pledged initial funds to the Climate Finance Partnership, which organizers said would be set up next year.
Cause_General	The one-day gathering in New York, where world leaders were gathered for the United Nations General Assembly, drew the leaders of global companies as well as more than two dozen heads of state and government.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The World Bank, which lends to developing countries, announced a platform to pledge $1 billion toward developing battery-storage technology.
Distant_Evaluation	Energy storage is becoming increasingly important as production of renewable energy rises, because the wind might not blow or the sun shine during the peak hours when most consumers turns on their lights and appliances.
Cause_General	Tech giant Google announced the launch of a tool to generate data on greenhouse gas emissions from road traffic and on the solar capacity of cities, which it captures through its popular mapping service Google Earth.
Distant_Evaluation	“If you cannot measure it you can’t manage it,” said Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who is now the U.N. Secretary General’s special envoy for Cities and Climate Change.
Cause_General	Cities worldwide account for more than 70 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.
Cause_Specific	Climate change is causing more frequent and severe flooding, droughts, storms and heatwaves as average global temperatures rise to new records, sea ice melts in the Arctic and sea levels rise.
Cause_General	The second “One Planet” summit took place nearly three years after almost 200 governments agreed the Paris accord to end the fossil-fuel era this century and limit further global warming to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial times.
Distant_Historical	U.S. President Donald Trump weakened the pact last year when he said the United States, the world’s second biggest greenhouse gas polluter after China, would pull out.
Distant_Evaluation	SOMETIMES it feels as if there is a red state-blue state divide when it comes to hedge funds.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some people believe that if permitted to remain free from the shackles of dangerous government oversight, hedge funds can help solve problems from underfunded pensions to inept corporate management.
Distant_Evaluation	This group tends to include hedge fund employees and hedge fund investors.
Distant_Evaluation	Others believe that hedge funds are sinister forces that capitalize on superior information -- possibly obtained illegally -- and are hell-bent on pillaging the financial system to corner the market on luxury cars and palatial real estate.
Distant_Evaluation	This group includes much of the news media and the Connecticut attorney general.
Distant_Evaluation	Yet hedge funds are neither saviors nor Satan.
Cause_General	There are more than 9,000 funds that vary greatly in the kinds of investments they make, returns they seek and strategies they employ.
Main	One of the few things they have in common -- other than gigantic paychecks when their returns are good -- is that the funds have become a more accepted fixture in the financial landscape.
Cause_General	A number of recent studies show that hedge fund investors are satisfied with the performance of their investments, even if that performance appears on paper to be less than stellar.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Widespread demand for risk-adjusted returns of 8 to 10 percent ensures that the money spigot will stay turned on.
Cause_General	(Risk adjusted means that the portfolio is hedged.
Cause_General	If the market slumps, the fund's returns should not.)
Cause_General	For example, the top performers of the 2007 Commonfund Benchmarks Study of Educational Endowments, a survey of college, university and other educational endowments and foundations in the United States, were almost 50 percent invested in ''alternatives'' -- hedge funds, private equity, real estate, distressed debt, energy and natural resources and venture capital.
Cause_General	Hedge funds constituted the largest portion -- 44 to 70 percent -- of the alternatives category.
Cause_General	Average returns for the foundations and endowments that responded to the survey were 10.6 percent, while the leaders posted returns of more than 16.8 percent.
Cause_General	The top 10 percent of performers among the endowments allocated 49 percent of their money to alternatives, compared with 11 percent for fixed income, 18 percent for domestic equity and 21 percent for international equity.
Cause_General	The top quartile of performers also show a heavy weighting to alternatives: 46 percent, compared with 11 percent for fixed income, 20 percent for international equity and 21 percent for domestic equity.
Distant_Evaluation	Even though hedge funds represented the bulk of investment dollars, their returns were lackluster.
Distant_Historical	In 2006, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index had a total return, when dividends were reinvested, of 15.8 percent.
Distant_Historical	Overall returns for alternatives averaged 14.6 percent.
Distant_Historical	Energy and natural resources produced a stunning return of 40 percent; distressed debt, 26 percent; and private equity, 19 percent.
Distant_Historical	Hedge funds turned out only 10.6 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	But investors did not seem to be bothered.
Distant_Evaluation	''It was nice to see hedge funds were doing what they are supposed to do,'' said John S. Griswold Jr. executive director of the Commonfund Institute, a research organization dedicated to educating the nonprofit community about investing.
Distant_Evaluation	''They should lag a rapidly rising stock market,'' he explained, ''because hedging has a cost.''
Distant_Evaluation	The money continues to flow into hedge funds.
Cause_General	Hedge Fund Research, a Chicago-based research firm, estimates that $110 billion flowed into new funds through November.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A study released by Deutsche Bank yesterday surveyed investors who represent $900 billion of the total $1.4 trillion in the industry and predicted that $110 billion will flow into the sector in 2007.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''I don't think demand will slow down anytime soon unless we see a lot of disasters,'' Mr. Griswold said.
Distant_Evaluation	''There's a bit of a herd mentality here.
Distant_Evaluation	If you are not in hedge funds, people look funny at you, like, 'Why aren't you?'
Distant_Evaluation	''
Distant_Evaluation	Heavy investments in alternatives and hedge funds in particular have paid off for endowments.
Cause_General	More than 79 percent of the growth in endowments with assets of $500 million to $1 billion resulted from investment returns (as opposed to gifts, for example).
Cause_General	Institutions with more than $1 billion derived more than 75 percent of their returns from their investments, according to the Commonfund survey.
Cause_General	A separate study conducted by Casey, Quirk & Associates last fall also showed satisfied customers.
Cause_General	About 72 percent of respondents said that hedge fund returns came within 1 percentage point of their target.
Cause_General	A surprising 25 percent of investors said they did better than expected: 19 percent exceeded their target by 1 to 5 percentage point.
Cause_General	Only 3 percent said their investment underperformed.
Distant_Evaluation	There are other reasons to expect robust growth.
Distant_Evaluation	Pension funds are wading in, raising their investments in alternatives in general and hedge funds in particular.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Casey, Quirk study estimated that institutions globally will add $1 trillion in money by 2010, compared with $360 billion today.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The growing role of institutions has tempered expectations about returns: 80 percent of those surveyed by Casey, Quick said they expected returns below 10 percent, with the bulk anticipating 8 to 9 percent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Only 20 percent expected more than 10 percent.
Cause_General	Megabucks compensation, meanwhile, still draws talent to hedge funds.
Cause_Specific	''Hedge funds are here to stay because of the compensation,'' Mr. Griswold said.
Distant_Evaluation	''This is where the best and brightest managers are gravitating to.''
Distant_Evaluation	The unforgiving nature of the industry means that those who do not perform will be booted out.
Cause_General	According to Hedge Fund Research, since the beginning of 2005 almost 1,300 hedge funds have closed.
Cause_General	During that time, more than 3,000 have been started.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There will be more Amaranth Advisors (which was based in Greenwich, Conn.) -- funds that blow up because of bad and greedy bets.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There will be frauds and there may be a market meltdown.
Distant_Evaluation	But alternative investing -- in private companies, with hedge fund managers who more aggressively try to time the markets, and in forests and wineries, is thriving.

Distant_Evaluation	"NASHVILLE, the United States, Sept. 26 (Xinhua) -- ""They should put a 'federal tariff tax' on receipts, so people can understand that they are ultimately paying for the price of trade wars,"" Glenn Anderson, who runs the Tennessee Medical Cannabis Trade Association, said at a recent gathering here."
Main	The gathering, held at the Tennessee Brew Works last Thursday, was aimed at voicing concerns and raising awareness over recent tariff measures from Washington.
Cause_General	During the event, speakers as well as members of the audience shared personal experiences, observations, and at times satire regarding how the tariffs negatively impacted their lives.
Distant_Anecdotal	One speaker on the podium was 38-year-old farmer Brandon Whitt, who manages a 200-year-old farm, Batey Farms, not far from Nashville.
Distant_Anecdotal	Whitt, an eighth-generation farmer, said the abrupt imposition of tariffs this year made him fear that he might have to give up his farm.
Distant_Anecdotal	Batey Farms produces a variety of crops, such as soybeans, corn and wheat, and raises a large number of pigs.
Distant_Anecdotal	A large part of the farm's produce ends up in overseas markets.
Distant_Evaluation	But due to the trade frictions the United States has initiated with other countries, overseas demand for U.S. agricultural products has tanked, driving down the prices for soybeans and pork, among others.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""I'm making 50 bushels an acre of soybeans, but that's 50 bushels per acre at a two-dollar decrease,"" Whitt said."
Distant_Anecdotal	"""I've done absolutely nothing wrong and lost 100 dollars an acre in profit."""
Distant_Anecdotal	"""I'd like to carry our administration with me when I go to cash my grain checks and watch me deposit those checks and then immediately turn around and drive across town to my lender, whom I have to pay off except I'm missing 20, 30, 40 percent of that money to be able to pay off that operating loan,"" Whitt lamented."
Distant_Evaluation	Aside from damages, the uncertainties that come with the tariffs are also making farmers very uncomfortable.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""Nobody has a crystal ball."
Distant_Anecdotal	I don't think our officials in Washington have a crystal ball at all at this point right now.
Distant_Anecdotal	"I think we're just kind of flying by the seat of our pants,"" Whitt said, in an apparent jab at the U.S. government."
Distant_Anecdotal	The situation is almost like before the 2008 recession, Whitt said, adding that now people are just as discouraged to invest and hire as they were 10 years ago.
Distant_Anecdotal	Whitt said that as a farmer, he shouldn't be diverting his energy to learn about foreign policy or trade, but the status quo has left him with no choice.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""I don't like politics, but I have to get into politics,"" Whitt said, adding that Washington's ever-changing positions and frequent threats have made the situation more challenging."
Distant_Anecdotal	"Whitt also rejected the idea of subsidies, calling them a ""band-aid handout."""
Distant_Evaluation	Accompanying Whitt on stage was Steven Livingston, a professor of political science at Middle Tennessee State University, who said farms are not the only ones hit by the tariffs in the state.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	All the leading industries in the state, such as the automotive, chemicals, paper, plastic and boat manufacturing industries will all be negatively impacted by higher trade barriers, Livingston said, estimating a 1-billion-dollar loss for the state in foreign trade.
Distant_Evaluation	The message resonated with those off stage.
Distant_Anecdotal	Josh Beatty, who owns a real estate company, said he came to the event to learn more about the potential damage of tariffs.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""A lot of the lumber and steel I use in construction are imported, so I want to be prepared for any potential changes,"" Beatty said, who was on his first visit to Nashville from Minneapolis."
Cause_General	"The gathering, one in a series of town hall meetings under the banner ""Tariffs hurt the Heartland,"" was organized by the activist groups Americans for Free Trade and Farmers for Free Trade."
Distant_Evaluation	Brian Kuehl, executive director of Farmers for Free Trade, told Xinhua that the purpose of the meetings was to raise awareness of the impacts of tariffs and trade frictions and provide a platform for people to share their opinions and stories.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The reason we are focusing on the heartland is because the heartland is hurt by the trade war and in the 2016 elections the heartland supported President (Donald) Trump."

Error	To go with Xinhua Headlines: Trump's tariffs disruptive to supply chains, but shifting them away from China won't be easy (Xinhua/Hu Yousong)
Main	NEW YORK, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration's tariffs on Chinese products, which expanded to an additional 200 billion U.S. dollars' worth of goods in September, are forcing businesses to rethink their supply chains.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But given China's comparative advantages as well as cost and market rules, it would not be easy to shift the supply chains away from China, U.S. trade experts have told Xinhua.
Distant_Evaluation	CHINA: ONLY SOURCE OF IMPORTS FOR MANY PRODUCTS
Distant_Evaluation	"""Tariffs are taxes that raise costs for businesses and consumers."
Distant_Evaluation	Families will see higher prices for countless products.
Distant_Evaluation	"For retailers, tariffs are very disruptive to complex global supply chains,"" U.S. National Retail Federation (NRF) spokeswoman Bethany Aronhalt told Xinhua."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Right now, retailers are assessing their supply chains to determine possible alternative sources, but for certain products, China is the only source that exists,"" she said."
Cause_General	The NRF is the world's largest retail trade association representing discount and department stores, grocers, wholesalers, chain restaurants and Internet retailers from the United States and more than 45 countries and regions.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"The group, the spokeswoman said, holds that ""tariffs and the retaliatory actions that follow are a threat to just about every sector of the U.S. economy, including manufacturing, agriculture, technology, retail, energy and more."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Adjusting supply chains is ""not that simple in a global economy."
Distant_Evaluation	"Businesses make production or sourcing decisions months and years in advance, and they rely on very complex supply chains,"" she said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Retailers and other importers could not easily or quickly switch to domestic sources because they do not exist on the scale that would be needed,"" she said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Even if there were to be an eventual switch to U.S. sourcing, it would take years to build up a base to support it."
Distant_Evaluation	And for many products subject to tariffs, China is the sole source of U.S. imports.
Distant_Evaluation	"No alternative sources exist,"" she said."
Distant_Evaluation	WHAT ARE CHINA'S ADVANTAGES?
Distant_Evaluation	As the new wave of tariffs which came on top of the 50 billion dollars' worth already taxed earlier this year begins to make China look more expensive, few other places around the world could match China's advantages -- its highly skilled labor and the reliability of the supply chains.
Cause_General	Before the tariffs, some labor-intensive manufacturers have already started leaving China as the country's wages have risen for the past 10 to 15 years in a row, Mary Lovely, an American professor of economics and an expert on trade with China, told Xinhua in an interview.
Cause_General	They have already seen apparel, footwear, toys, sporting goods and some electronics moving elsewhere in Asia.
Distant_Evaluation	"""These are things that we would expect because as China develops, the rest of East Asia or the poorer countries of East Asia also expect to be pulled along with that train,"" said Lovely, who is a professor of economics at Syracuse University and a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics."
Distant_Evaluation	"""China is an engine of growth for the region, so none of that is surprising,"" she said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""The tariffs will likely accelerate that,"" she said, adding that firms that are thinking about moving will probably go ahead because these additional 25 percent tariffs will make it very tough for them to compete with subcontractors in other countries that won't face these tariffs."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""And that puts competitive pressure on China so it will accelerate changes in global value chains,"" she said."
Distant_Evaluation	But not all firms can do that, she said.
Distant_Evaluation	For one thing, companies produce or purchase higher value items from China, which are made by more highly skilled labor and are reflecting relationships that have developed, she said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Many of those supply chains are certified by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in the United States or other regulatory bodies and moving them is difficult,"" she said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""So there's a great deal of uncertainty and firms are really in doubt as to what they should do because moving the supply chain is costly."
Distant_Evaluation	"Before you want to do that, you want to make sure that it's something that you really need to do,"" she said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"She warned that ""the uncertainty causes a kind of paralysis on investment and we are already seeing some slowdown in investment flows."""
Cause_General	According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis released in July, net foreign direct investment dropped to 51.3 billion dollars in the first quarter, a 37 percent fall from the same quarter in 2017 and a 65 percent decline from the first quarter of 2016.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES FOR U.S.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Texas-based arts and crafts retail chain, Michaels, has warned in early September that retail prices could be hit by the U.S. administration's new round of tariffs on Chinese imports.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	An estimated 400 million dollars of its product costs would be subject to the new round of tariffs, Chief Executive Officer Chuck Rubin told a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. retail conference in New York on Sept. 5.
Distant_Evaluation	"But the cost of goods to fill its shelves is not what annoys the largest American arts and crafts retail chain most as Michaels has ""a lot of levers"" it can pull to mitigate the impact, Rubin said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"While the company with a large bulk of its goods coming from China is looking into shifting manufacturing to other countries, he said, ""There is virtually no possibility of moving manufacturing into the U.S."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Companies that are forced to rethink their sourcing may find their hands tied as ""supply chains are built by companies with great care and substantial analysis,"" said Professor Robert Sicina, executive in residence of Kogod School of Business at the Washington-based American University."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""To disrupt them is to negatively impact the confidence firms have in the U.S. having a consistent policy,"" Sicina told Xinhua in an interview."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Without consistency, firms will move their supply chains away from the U.S., not towards it."
Distant_Evaluation	"This is just one example of the unintended consequences of President (Donald) Trump's actions,"" said Sicina, who has 30 years of experience in senior executive positions at big banks and various entrepreneurial endeavors."
Distant_Evaluation	"""The supply chain is always going to move to where the economics are best,"" he said, adding that ""the economics are overwhelmingly in favor of China."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Another major, long-term unintended consequence, Sicina said, is that ""foreign investment in the U.S. will also be disrupted because of the tariffs."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	When investment flows into the United States, foreign investors have to consider its trade policies, as extra tariffs will impact investors' ability to import raw materials and export their products, Sicina said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Trump's trade war is to curb foreign investment in the future, because they're going to lack confidence that the U.S. will play by the rules, because it's now breaking the rules of fair trade in expectation of cutting a better deal with China,"" he said."

Main	MANILA, Sept. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) launched on Tuesday its first Trade Finance Scorecard, a new tool to address market gaps stemming from the unintended consequences of global measures to fight money-laundering and terrorism.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Preventing criminals and terrorists from exploiting the global financial system is critically important,"" said ADB's Head of Trade and Supply Chain Finance Steven Beck."
Distant_Evaluation	"""But these regulations can also undermine jobs and growth at small businesses and developing countries."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"This new scorecard will open a channel of dialogue among stakeholders to help prevent crime and terrorism while financing growth and job creation,"" Beck said."
Distant_Evaluation	The ADB said the Trade Finance Scorecard focuses on issues related to the interpretation, implementation, and compliance with regulations designed to curb money laundering and the financing of terrorism in the context of correspondent banking and trade financing.
Cause_General	"""The scores are assigned on two levels."
Cause_General	Firstly, at a macro level, to identify characteristics of effective regulation that could be strengthened.
Cause_General	"Secondly, at a micro transactional level, to highlight specific challenges that can be addressed in the shorter term,"" the ADB said."
Cause_General	"The ADB added ""Elements of effective regulation outlined in the first level are scored out of 10 on seven criteria: consistency (4), risk alignment (3), design (2), stakeholder communication (5), technology and data (5), enforcement (4), and quality control (3)."
Cause_General	"These criteria are used to assess five working-level issues in the second level."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The ADB said the scorecard is based on feedback from industry leaders and regulators and will complement existing tools such as the Financial Action Task Force's recommendations against money laundering and terrorist financing.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The scores are illustrative and directional,"" said Beck, stressing the need to have ""better ways of addressing these issues, and we see the scorecard as the start of a process of engagement on this difficult subject."""
Distant_Evaluation	ADB's Trade Finance Program (TFP) closes market gaps by providing guarantees and loans to over 200 partner banks to support trade, helping companies across Asia to engage in import and export activities.
Distant_Historical	In 2017, TFP supported 4.5 billion U.S. dollars in trade through 3,505 transactions.
Cause_General	Its financial support is complemented by regular workshops and seminars to increase knowledge and expertise in trade finance products, anti-money laundering, and risk management.

Main	ROME, Sept. 28 (Xinhua) -- Financial markets were on their heels Friday, a day after Italy's populist, anti-establishment government announced it would widen its budget deficit in order to finance costly electoral promises.
Main	Thursday's blueprint says the government would widen the 2019 budget deficit to an estimated 2.4 percent of the gross domestic product, almost surely putting the country on a collision course with the European Union (EU).
Cause_General	The EU has called for Italy to focus on paying down the government's deficit, the highest in the bloc in absolute terms and the second highest when measured as a percentage of gross domestic product.
Cause_General	The 2.4-percent figure is around three times higher than the estimates put forward by the previous government, which ended its term May 31.
Cause_General	It is also far above the 1.6-perfect figure promised by Minister of Finance Giovanni Tria.
Cause_General	Still, it is below the more than 3.0-percent deficit the government said it wanted in August.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Tria, a political independent not associated with either of the political parties backing the Giuseppe Conte government, reportedly vowed to resign if he lost the battle over the budget.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There were no immediate signs Tria would follow through with his threat on Friday, but the Italian media reported it could still happen.
Cause_General	In absolute terms, the difference between Tria's 1.6-perfect deficit promise and the 2.4-percent target announced Thursday is around 175 billion euros (205 billion U.S. dollars) in extra spending.
Cause_General	That figure is more than the gross domestic products of 15 of the 28 EU member states, including Greece, the only EU country more indebted than Italy.
Cause_General	Italy has the third largest economy in the 19-nation euro currency union.
Distant_Evaluation	Luigi Di Maio, Italy's minister of labor and the head of the Five-Star Movement, said the extra spending would pay for itself through higher economic growth.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We must explain to markets that there are so many smart investments inside this 2.4-percent figures that we will be able to grow the economy as much as we want to,"" Di Maio said in a press conference."
Distant_Evaluation	But analysts were less convinced.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Before the figure was announced I thought that Tria's 1.6-percent figure was not likely, but that 2.4 or above would mean outright war with the European Union,"" Riccardo Puglisi, a political economist with the University of Pavia, told Xinhua."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""At close to 2.0-percent, it would have been a skirmish."
Distant_Evaluation	"But 2.4 percent is bad news."""
Distant_Evaluation	Ugo Arrigo, an economics and statistics professor with Bicocca University in Milan, said the decision was likely based on politics and not economics.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Really, the deficit should have been 1.6 or 1.7 percent,"" Arrigo said in an interview."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Above 2 is trouble because it means the government is putting electoral promises above sustainability."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Among the costly promises put forth by the four-month-old government: a universal basic income for all Italian citizens, an earlier retirement age for workers, and a flat tax for Italian companies.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The spending measures alone are expected to add at least 100 billion euros to the deficit.
Cause_General	Financial markets responded badly to the news: both because of the fiscal implications of the 2019 budget and the likelihood it could ultimately destabilize the government, especially if Tria stepped down.
Main_Consequence	In trading Friday, the first session after the latest developments, bond yields surged as much as 12 percent higher, reaching a yield of 3.35 percent in midday trading for the benchmark ten-year bonds.
Cause_General	That is approaching their highest yield since 2014.
Distant_Evaluation	Higher yields for bonds reflect investor nervousness, and they increase the government's costs when it borrows money.
Main_Consequence	The MIB-30 index of blue chip stocks also took a hit, falling 3.8 percent, with 27 of 30 issues losing ground.
Cause_General	Even the euro currency took a step back, losing around 1.5 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar, its weakest level in three weeks.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The full budget, including details for the spending plans, will be submitted to the EU next month.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Brussels could reject the measure, which would send the government back to the drawing board to restart negotiations.
Main	ALCANTARA SPACE CENTER, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazil is ready to launch small commercial rockets from its space base near the equator as soon as it agrees to safeguard U.S. technology that is dominant in the industry, the Brazilian Air Force officer managing the space program said on Friday.

Distant_Evaluation	Major Luiz Fernando Aguiar said Brazil wants to get a piece of the $300 billion-a-year space launch business by drawing U.S. companies interested in launching small satellites at a lower cost from the Alcantara base on its north coast.
Distant_Evaluation	“The microsatellite market is most attractive today and we are interested in the 50 to 500-kilo niche,” Aguiar told Reuters at the base’s main launch pad.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are developing a rocket for microsatellites.
Distant_Evaluation	For that this tower is totally ready.”
Cause_Specific	Space cooperation between the United States and Brazil took a big step forward when they signed a Space Situational Awareness (SSA) agreement last month during a visit to Brasilia by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis.
Cause_General	The accord on sharing real-time tracking data on objects and debris in space is needed to develop a satellite launching business without the risk of collision.
Distant_Historical	Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) in December visited the Alcantara space center, which is especially attractive to smaller firms, such as Tucson, Arizona-based rocket-maker Vector Launch Inc, because its equatorial location cuts fuel costs by a third allowing heavier payloads.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But Brazil’s plan to become a new hub in the space industry will depend on concluding a technology safeguard agreement (TSA) with the United States to protect sensitive American space launch and satellite technology, Aguiar said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Without it, no U.S. rocket can blast off from the South American country.
Distant_Historical	A previous attempt at a U.S.-Brazilian space partnership was scuttled in 2003 when the TSA ran into resistance from the leftist government of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and was thwarted by Brazilian lawmakers.
Distant_Evaluation	Aguiar said that agreement floundered because it allowed the U.S. unverified access to the Alcantara base that was not acceptable on sovereignty grounds.
Distant_Evaluation	A new Brazilian proposal under consideration by the U.S. government will be more “palatable” to the Brazilian Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	The TSA is seen by Washington as opening opportunities for greater cooperation in aerospace and defense between the two countries.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The market for small satellite launches is expected to grow fast in the next few years and the U.S. space industry is keen to see new launch capacity in the world and a quick resolution to the negotiation of the TSA with Brazil.
Distant_Evaluation	“Demand for launch services has outstripped supply globally and another launch site is needed.
Distant_Evaluation	Because of its location, Alcantara offers advantages no other site in the world provides,” an industry source said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Aguiar said the government will set up a company called Alada to market the launch site.
Cause_General	He said the Air Force has been in talks with Brazilian aerospace company Embraer SA on how to manage the business going forward.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	One possibility, Brazilian Air Force officials said, is a joint venture with Embraer’s satellite company Visiona, which is not part of the planned $4.75 billion tie-up between Boeing and Embraer’s commercial aviation arm.
Main	FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German publishing group Bertelsmann (BTGGg.F) said on Monday it was buying U.S. online education provider OnCourse Learning from private equity firm CIP Capital in a deal worth around $500 million.
Error	FILE PHOTO: Pencils with the logo of German media group Bertelsmann CEO are seen at the annual news conference Berlin, Germany, March 22, 2016.
Error	REUTERS/Fabrizio Bensch
Distant_Evaluation	The acquisition backs Bertelsmann’s push into digital education and training, and will boost its presence in the United States, a growth market which already contributes around a fifth of its sales.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are expanding our education business to include a company with significant growth potential,” said Bertelsmann’s chairman and CEO, Thomas Rabe.
Distant_Evaluation	“At the same time, the transaction will further strengthen our presence in the U.S., where we already generate more than 20 percent of our revenues.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In the future, we expect this share to rise to around 30 percent.”
Cause_General	OnCourse Learning, founded in 2007, is based in Brookfield, Wisconsin, and employs 375 people.
Cause_General	It provides digital corporate and advanced training courses for healthcare and financial services customers and has a smaller real-estate business.
Distant_Evaluation	“There’s certainly a significant opportunity for expanding into life-long learning,” Sarah Simon, media analyst at Berenberg, said of the deal.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We’re all going to have to work for ever, so there’s going to be more demand for people to re-skill themselves and change jobs.”
Distant_Evaluation	Bertelsmann is one of the few larger companies to invest in the field, along with U.S. publisher John Wiley (JWa.N), while Britain’s Pearson (PSON.L) is more focused on the school and college segment of the U.S. market, added Simon.
Cause_General	PORTFOLIO RESTRUCTURING
Cause_Specific	The acquisition is part of Rabe’s strategic push to invest in growth areas - Bertelsmann’s education division achieved revenue growth of 21 percent in the first half of the year, albeit from a small base.
Cause_General	The education division’s top line was just 111 million euros ($129 million) out of total revenues of 8.2 billion euros.
Cause_General	Bertelsmann’s largest business, television broadcaster RTL Group (RRTL.DE), is nearly 30 times bigger.
Cause_General	The publisher - which spans eight divisions - is meanwhile close to selling its Arvato CRM call-centre unit to free up capital to invest in growth projects while strengthening its established units, some of which face headwinds.
Cause_General	OnCourse Learning, which has an online library of around 22,000 courses, is used by around 750,000 people and 19,000 business customers.
Cause_General	The U.S. market for continuing education in healthcare and financial services is estimated at $3.6 billion.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Its healthcare division will be folded into Bertelsmann subsidiary Relias, which was acquired in 2014 and also operates in the industry, Bertelsmann said.
Cause_General	The company also has a stake in Udacity, a life-long learning platform founded by German computer scientist Sebastian Thrun.
Main	HONG KONG (Reuters) - At least five insurers, including Britain’s Prudential (PRU.L) and Canada’s Sun Life (SLF.TO), have bid for Commonwealth Bank of Australia’s (CBA) (CBA.AX) majority stake in an Indonesian insurance venture, people with knowledge of the process said.

Main	The stake sale, which could value the venture at between $250 million and $300 million, has also received second-round bids from insurer FWD Group, Singapore-listed Great Eastern Holdings (GELA.SI), and Indonesia’s Sequis Life, three people said.
Distant_Historical	Australia’s biggest lender is selling its 80 percent stake in PT Commonwealth Life, which has a presence in 20 Indonesian cities with more than 500,000 individual and group customers, Reuters reported in January.
Distant_Evaluation	The interest in PT Commonwealth Life is the latest case of foreign insurers wanting to expand their life business in Southeast Asia, a region of more than 600 million people.
Distant_Historical	In March, CBA confirmed that it was undertaking a strategic review of its Indonesian life insurance business, and that it has engaged external advisers for guidance on a possible sale of the venture.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The second-round bids were submitted last week, the people said, adding potential buyers are likely to be further short-listed within the next few weeks before a decision is made by CBA.
Cause_General	Representatives of CBA, FWD, Great Eastern, Prudential, and Sun Life declined to comment.
Cause_General	Sequis said it could not comment now as it was “bound by NDA”, or non-disclosure agreement.
Cause_General	The people declined to be named as they were not allowed to talk to the media about the deal process.
Cause_General	The Australian lender has been selling some of its businesses over the past year after suffering a string of scandals including rate-rigging charges, breaches of anti-money laundering laws, and fees charged to dead clients.
Distant_Historical	CBA sold its insurance business in Australia and New Zealand to AIA Group (1299.HK) for $3.1 billion last year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It also said this year its loss-making digital banking unit in South Africa was being sold for an undisclosed sum.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Indonesian stake sale, if completed, will also be another instance of Asian banks exiting the insurance sector to free up capital and focus on their core banking businesses amid tougher regulatory capital buffer requirements.
Cause_General	GROWING MARKET
Distant_Evaluation	Asia is a battleground for foreign insurers including Aviva (AV.L), Prudential and Sun Life, attracted by the region’s lower insurance penetration levels and faster growth rates for insurance premiums.
Cause_Specific	The people said the foreign insurers competing for CBA’s stake in the Indonesian venture were looking to bolster their presence in Southeast Asia, which has seen a handful of M&A deals in the last couple of years in the insurance sector.
Cause_General	Swiss group Zurich Insurance (ZURN.S) said on Thursday it was acquiring an 80 percent stake in Indonesia’s Adira Insurance from PT Bank Danamon Indonesia (BDMN.JK) and a minority investor for at least $414 million.
Cause_General	FWD, owned by Hong Kong billionaire tycoon Richard Li, has agreed to buy HSBC Holdings’ (HSBA.L) stake in a Malaysian insurance joint venture as part of a plan to expand its presence in Asia, sources told Reuters last month.
Cause_General	Sun Life, which operates in seven Asian markets including China, Hong Kong, India, the Philippines and Malaysia, has in recent years made a series of deals in the region to acquire businesses or raise its ownership in several of those markets.
Distant_Historical	CBA raised its holding in Commonwealth Life to 80 percent in 2007 in what was then a 50:50 joint venture.
Cause_General	The remaining 20 percent is owned by an Indonesian firm, PT Gala Arta Jaya, according to the insurer’s website.
Cause_General	Besides the insurance joint venture, CBA also has a retail and business banking presence in Indonesia.
Main	BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are asking retailers and manufacturers whether Amazon’s (AMZN.O) sales of own brand products similar to theirs have harmed their business, a move which could lead to a formal case and possibly fines against the U.S. tech giant.

Cause_Specific	European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said last week she was looking into whether the world’s largest online retailer was using merchants’ data illegally.
Cause_General	The European Commission’s focus is on Amazon’s dual function, as a company hosting merchants on its site and as a rival to these same retailers via its own products, made or improved based on the retailers’ data.
Main	In a questionnaire sent to retailers, the Commission asked whether Amazon’s own brand products launched in the past five years were identical or very similar to rival products offered on its platform.
Cause_General	Merchants were asked how Amazon’s products have affected their business, their investment, marketing, pricing, sales strategy and business decisions, and whether the number of sellers increased or decreased following Amazon’s entry.
Cause_General	Regulators also wanted to know if Amazon had contacted retailers or their suppliers before launching new products.
Cause_General	Merchants were asked to provide documents such as exchanges with Amazon or their suppliers and screenshots of websites to prove their claims.
Cause_General	Retailers were given until Oct. 9 to reply to the 16-page questionnaire.
Cause_General	One of the companies surveyed by the Commission posted the questionnaire online.
Cause_General	Amazon declined to comment.
Cause_Specific	Vestager has said she wants to check whether all the data gathered by Amazon gives it an edge.
Cause_Specific	“Is that giving you as the big guy, and in some member states a very big guy, an advantage that cannot be matched because you have this special access to data?,” she told reporters in Washington on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	The issue has two competition angles, said an antitrust lawyer who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
Distant_Evaluation	“Is there an abuse of dominance in the market and the way Amazon deals with sensitive data?” the lawyer said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Vestager can levy fines of up to 10 percent of a company’s global turnover for breaching EU rules as well as force them to change their business practices.

Main	BEIJING, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- China will roll out the decoupling of business licenses and operation permits as a nationwide program starting this November, and further cut production permits for industrial goods by over one third in an effort to ease corporate burdens, the State Council's executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang decided on Wednesday.
Cause_General	The Chinese government places high importance on the reform of decoupling business licenses and operation permits, which are both required for starting business operations, as an important step in fostering a law-based, enabling business environment up to international standards.
Distant_Historical	Premier Li Keqiang stressed the imperative to advance this reform, making it clear at the plenary session of the National People's Congress last March that the reform will be introduced nationwide this year.
Distant_Historical	He put particular emphasis on resolving the problem of companies being unable to operate even after they have received business licenses.
Distant_Historical	This reform was piloted late 2015 in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, targeting 116 items of administrative approval.
Cause_General	It was later implemented in all of Shanghai.
Cause_General	It was pointed out at the Wednesday meeting that introducing the decoupling nationwide constitutes a key step in implementing the broader reform of government functions.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The reform will help improve the business environment, energize the market and catalyze stronger development.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Decoupling business licenses and operation permits is the right way to go, as it meets both corporate and public needs."
Distant_Evaluation	"It is a necessary part of the reform of our market economy system, and a step we must take,"" Li said."
Main	The Wednesday meeting announced that starting from November 10 this year, an approach of reduced number of required permits and certificates after receiving business licenses will be applied nationwide to the first batch of some 100 business-related government approval items.
Main	Items that are no longer necessary for administrative approval or are eligible for self-improvement through market forces will become approval-free or require registration only.
Main	The practice of notification commitment shall be applied to those government review items that need to stay, yet any non-compliance with the permitting requirements can be redressed by government oversight.
Main	Under such practice, a market entity shall be approved for business activities when it commits to complying with all the permitting requirements.
Main	A company violating this commitment shall see its license revoked and face heavy penalties.
Main	Improved access services will be applied to the government review items concerning public security and public health where notification commitment does not fit.
Main	However, efforts will be made to reduce the required materials, streamline procedures, and cut the reviewing time to keep the permitting process transparent and make market access easier for start-up and innovative businesses.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It is important to put greater emphasis on implementing new, intensified efforts for compliance oversight while easing market access in advancing the reform of decoupling business licenses and operation permits, and enhance fair supervision,"" Li said."
Main	The Wednesday meeting also decided to cancel the required production permits for 14 types of industrial goods.
Main	Production permits for goods relating to public security, public health and environmental protection shall be replaced by mandatory certification.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A list of these products will be compiled and released to the public, and certification charges shall be funded by public finance.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This reform of decoupling business licenses and operation permits should be well-paced as realities differ across the country."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"The reform may move faster in places where conditions are fully in place, yet no one-size-fits-all approach should be applied,"" Li stressed."
Distant_Evaluation	"""This is another test on our ability to govern."""

Main	LHASA, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- Foreign trade in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region was stable in 2018.
Main	Official data showed that Tibet's import and export volume totaled 4.752 billion yuan (701 million U.S. dollars) last year.
Main	Meanwhile, trade between border residents exceeded 100 million yuan, a year-on-year increase of 169.3 percent.
Main	Trade with Nepal rose 4.6 percent year on year and accounted for 52.6 percent of all foreign trade.
Cause_General	Tibet has rolled out a series of measures to enhance border trade, while actively joining in the Belt and Road Initiative, which provided a strong impetus to its foreign trade development, said Liu Dali, chief of Lhasa Customs.
Cause_General	Local authorities' promotion of economic cooperation with countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia also contributed to the stable foreign trade.
Cause_Specific	Last year, 26 new foreign-invested enterprises were set up in Tibet, bringing a foreign capital of 60 million U.S. dollars.

Main	HANOI, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has set a target of reaping some 2.4 billion U.S. dollars from exporting tra fish or shark catfish, a common kind of catfish, this year, posting a year-on-year rise of around 9 percent.
Cause_Specific	Vietnam made a total tra fish output of 1.4 million tons in 2018, up 20 percent against 2017, part of which were exported, fetching over 2.2 billion U.S. dollars, up 26.4 percent, according to the Vietnam Tra Fish Association on Thursday.
Cause_Specific	Specifically, Vietnam gained 549.4 million U.S. dollars from exporting tra fish to the United States last year, up 59.5 percent, and 243.9 million U.S. dollars from shipping the fish to the European Union, up 20.2 percent.
Cause_General	Vietnam's Mekong Delta is striving to regulate tra fish output and improving quality of the fish, partly by preventing unauthorized aquaculture and strictly monitoring the use of chemicals like antibiotics in farming, the association said.

Main	LUSAKA, Feb. 17 (Xinhua) -- A Zambian firm has started importing smart electric vehicles from China, an official said on Sunday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Amilak Investments, which launched the smart electric vehicles last December, is upbeat about the development and envisages that this will turn around the country's transport sector.
Cause_General	The cars are designed in Germany but manufactured in China.
Cause_Specific	"""We launched these smart electric cars on December 14 and had several stakeholders who came to witness this milestone,"" Andrew Kazilimani, the firm's director of operations said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He said the first phase of the project involves importing the cars directly from China while plans were underway to establish a manufacturing factory in one of the multifacility economic zones in the country.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The initiative, he said, will make Zambia a hub in the supply of electric cars in the southern African region.
Cause_General	According to him, there were many benefits of using electric cars such as no expenses on fuel and no periodic maintenance required.
Cause_General	Ackim Nyirongo, the firm's director of sales and marketing, said about 10 electric cars have so far been ordered for stocking and will be arriving in the country next month.

Main	SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Energy trader Vitol [VITOLV.UL] will stop doing business with Iran after the United States re-imposes sanctions on Tehran’s oil trade from Nov. 4, a senior company executive said on Tuesday.
Distant_Evaluation	“Business with Iran or anything to do with Iran has to come to an end,” said Mike Muller, who handles business development for Vitol, on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) in Singapore.
Cause_Specific	“We have a long-standing relationship with Iran and clearly I look forward to when trade can be resumed, but for now, one needs explicit waivers from the U.S., and not just the U.S. but the global banking community and everything else,” he said.
Distant_Historical	The United States announced in May that it would re-impose sanctions on Iran, the third-largest producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, to force the country to renegotiate an agreement limiting Iran’s nuclear program.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The sanctions started on Aug. 7 with limitations on the country’s access to the global financial system and in November will be extended to Iran’s petroleum sector.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some traders are forecasting that the sanctions could remove up to 1.5 million barrels per day of crude from the market.
Cause_General	Global benchmark Brent crude jumped more than 3 percent on Monday to a four-year high above $80 a barrel after Saudi Arabia and Russia ruled out any immediate increase in production despite calls by U.S. President Donald Trump for action to raise global supply.
Error	<O/R>
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Any push towards higher oil prices will need new drivers, with the current oil prices having already factored in market risks, Muller said in comments during APPEC.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Anything leading to higher numbers will require some new evidence coming to light,” he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Substantial additions of non-OPEC supply of up to 2 million barrels per day could flow to global markets next year, with half of that to come from the United States, he added.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He declined to provide an oil price forecast but his comments appear to be less bullish than commodity traders such as Mercuria and Trafigura which said oil could spike to $100 a barrel by early 2019.
Distant_Evaluation	Separately, Muller added that a deal to acquire stakes in Nigerian offshore fields that are held by Brazil’s Petrobras and its partners, is not yet finalised.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“It’s a deal that’s going to be rather big for Vitol... there is a transaction being finalised,” he said.
Distant_Historical	Reuters reported in June that a consortium led by Vitol has entered exclusive talks to acquire the assets which are estimated to be worth up to $2.5 billion.
Main	BEIJING (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, long opposed to producing its premium Lexus cars in China because of concerns over quality and profitability, is now considering it to ignite growth and narrow sales gaps with its German rivals, four company insiders told Reuters.
Cause_General	The company, which imports Lexus models made in Japan to sell in China, has spent the last two years researching how to produce them locally.
Distant_Historical	Toyota also talked to its Chinese joint-venture partners – Guangzhou Automobile Group Co and FAW Group - last year about Lexus models.
Distant_Historical	It wasn’t clear whether Toyota approached the Chinese companies about a partnership or vice versa.
Distant_Evaluation	Local production would be a major shift for the world’s largest automaker, encouraged by improved China-Japan ties, as well as new Chinese investment rules that might allow foreign automakers to fully own or majority-control China operations.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’re torn over this,” said one of the insiders.
Distant_Evaluation	“But it makes little sense to let this opportunity slip by,” another told Reuters.
Cause_General	All four insiders declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
Cause_Specific	China’s planned scrapping of foreign ownership restrictions in the auto industry is in part a response to criticism that Chinese companies have been largely allowed to invest freely in outside markets while Beijing limits foreign firms’ access to the world’s second-largest economy.
Cause_General	The rule changes - affecting electric carmakers this year and others by 2022 - led Tesla Inc to gain Beijing’s approval for a wholly-owned China manufacturing and sales company in Shanghai.
Cause_General	That marked the first time a foreign carmaker established itself in China without a partner.
Cause_General	Toyota already produces numerous Toyota-brand models, including the Camry, Highlander, Corolla, Levin and Crown, in China with partners.
Distant_Historical	Last year it sold 1.29 million cars there, including imported Lexuses.
Distant_Historical	Toyota had contemplated moving Lexus production to China before - as far back as 2011-12, according to one of the four insiders.
Distant_Evaluation	But it had until now considered a potential erosion of quality too much of a risk, and didn’t want to sacrifice the brand’s relatively high margins by sharing profits with a local partner.
Cause_General	Two of the Toyota insiders said the automaker had identified specific scenarios for localizing Lexus.
Distant_Evaluation	“All the preparation has been more or less completed,” one said.
Distant_Evaluation	“All we’re waiting is a ‘go’ from management.”
Distant_Evaluation	TRICKY TIMING
Distant_Evaluation	Toyota’s preferred option is to own all or most of a localized Lexus unit, which it could do immediately by building only electric cars.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	(Lexus has plans for electric battery and plug-in electric hybrid versions of existing models.)
Error	FILE PHOTO: Toyota workers inspect the new Lexus ES vehicles at a Toyota plant in Miyawaka, southern Japan, July 6, 2012.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But China might not let another brand in when the market has slowed down significantly, with sales of some foreign vehicles, including Groupe PSA, Ford and Hyundai, all falling in the gutter in recent months.
Distant_Evaluation	“You’d still need a good political follow-wind to execute this,” one of the sources said, pointing to help from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has a state visit to China planned for this month.
Cause_General	Even as other premium brands - such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac - have opened assembly plants in China to gain market share, Toyota has resisted.
Distant_Evaluation	That reluctance reflects the company’s unwillingness to share with a Chinese partner a brand painstakingly built since 1989 into a top premium car in the United States.
Cause_General	Opponents inside Toyota also point to China’s lowering tariffs on passenger cars to 15 percent from 25 percent in July as a reason to keep importing Lexuses.
Cause_General	They also note that the nearest Lexus plant to China is at the northern tip of Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu -only two days from Shanghai by sea.
Distant_Evaluation	A Toyota spokesman in Tokyo said “the most important task” for Lexus is to become a distinguished brand in China.
Distant_Evaluation	“We always weigh the need for localizing production as part of the consideration for the Lexus brand’s future in China,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“But at this point in time, we don’t have any specific plans for producing Lexus cars in China.”
Distant_Evaluation	Nonetheless, support for localization is growing among Toyota leaders.
Distant_Evaluation	China has typically been a difficult market for Japanese companies, but there is new optimism, especially after an official visit to Japan by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang in May.
Distant_Historical	During his visit, Li toured Toyota facilities on the northern island of Hokkaido, escorted by the company’s family scion and chief executive, Akio Toyoda.
Cause_General	Toyoda has since sought to boost his company’s presence in China, including an effort to significantly expand its manufacturing capacity and distribution networks, and share more technologies with Chinese companies.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	NEED FOR SPEED
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	China has also proposed limiting new production capacity for automakers, adding an incentive for Toyota to move quickly if it wants to build Lexus models there.
Cause_General	Nissan Motor Co and Toyota have each recently revealed plans to boost capacity, much of which will be used to produce electric cars.
Distant_Evaluation	Alan Kang, a Shanghai-based analyst for consultancy LMC Automotive, thinks localizing production is exactly what Lexus needs to start narrowing the big sales gap with German premium brands.
Error	Slideshow (2 Images)
Distant_Historical	Mercedes-Benz, for example, last year sold about 610,000 vehicles, compared to 130,000 for Lexus during the same year, according to LMC.
Distant_Evaluation	“If Lexus doesn’t want to remain a niche, it needs to start investing more,” Kang said.
Error	WANTED: Central banker who can curb ''irrational exuberance'' among stock market investors.
Error	Statesmen with international credibility preferred.
Error	Availability soon.
Distant_Evaluation	Too bad Alan Greenspan, who does not speak Chinese, can't apply.
Main	One of the biggest challenges for Chinese leaders these days lies in when and how to rein in the country's soaring stock market and, just as important, whom to pick as the next governor of the central bank.
Distant_Evaluation	The challenges are closely intertwined.
Cause_General	Like Mr. Greenspan nearly a decade ago, Zhou Xiaochuan, the current governor of the People's Bank of China, faces the knotty question of what to do about a speculative mania that has drawn millions of people with limited investing experience into betting their savings on the stock market.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Greenspan, now 81, struggled to contain the tech stock boom, issuing his famous ''irrational exuberance'' warning in December 1996 only to watch the American market keep rising and finally collapse in early 2000.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He tried his hand at forecasting Chinese stocks on Wednesday, telling an audience in Madrid by satellite that the Chinese market was ''clearly unsustainable'' and could undergo a ''dramatic contraction.''
Cause_Specific	After setting records on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the A shares, those traded in yuan, fell 0.47 percent in Shanghai and 0.6 percent in Shenzhen on Thursday as investors responded to the warning.
Distant_Evaluation	But the warning was not news to Mr. Zhou and other Chinese officials.
Cause_General	The central bank, securities regulators and prominent business executives have all been cautioning investors that buying stocks is not a guaranteed path to riches -- all with less apparent effect than Mr. Greenspan.
Distant_Evaluation	''Will the Shanghai market correct at some stage?
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Yes, that's inevitable,'' said Michael R. P. Smith, the chief executive of HSBC's extensive Asian operations.
Distant_Evaluation	''Valuations are too high, I think; you can't sustain P/E multiples of 40, 50 times.''
Distant_Evaluation	The economy is booming, but fairly low inflation, 3 percent, also makes for a conundrum similar to what Mr. Greenspan faced as Federal Reserve chairman: it is harder for Mr. Zhou to justify raising interest rates significantly.
Distant_Evaluation	For Mr. Zhou, there is a further complication in that he faces considerable uncertainty about his personal future.
Cause_General	Five years into his current job, he turns 60 next year, and so by Chinese standards is due for a transfer or promotion.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''It could come at any time; I tend to think it will happen before the 17th Party Congress,'' expected in October or November, said Victor Shih, a Chinese banking specialist at Northwestern.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Whoever succeeds Mr. Zhou confronts one of the toughest challenges of any financial policy maker.
Cause_General	Chinese families eager to make money are opening brokerage accounts around the country, with the number of new accounts rocketing from several thousand a day two years ago to nearly 300,000 a day this month.
Distant_Evaluation	Investors leaving a Shanghai brokerage firm on Wednesday were exuberant, as the Shanghai A share index closed at 4,354.
Distant_Anecdotal	Chen Zhiwei, a restaurant chef, said, ''With more new stocks listed, the bullish trend will keep going until the index hits 15,000.''
Distant_Evaluation	Like Mr. Greenspan in the heat of the Internet frenzy, Mr. Zhou and his colleagues in the Chinese government have been cautious about trying to pop the bubble themselves.
Distant_Historical	The Chinese government chose administrative measures, instead of market forces like higher interest rates, to prevent the economy from overheating in 2004 and to curb real estate speculation over the last two years.
Cause_General	The government has taken a few such measures this year, like investigating fund managers to make sure that they do not engage in self-dealing at the expense of their clients, and requiring this week that new brokerage customers sign forms acknowledging that they understand the risks of stocks.
Cause_Specific	But stocks sailed higher on Wednesday after an announcement by the finance ministry and State Administration of Taxation that the government had no plans to raise taxes on share transactions, an approach the government has sometimes taken in the past to curb speculation.
Cause_General	Cash is pouring into the stock market partly because money is pouring into China in general.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With the Chinese government intervening heavily in currency markets to hold down the value of the yuan against the dollar, China is on course for a surplus this year of up to $400 billion in the current account, the broadest measure of trade.
Distant_Evaluation	The Chinese leadership has shown considerable caution in allowing the currency to appreciate.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Zhou declared Wednesday morning that gradualism would remain China's policy as it pursues a long-term strategy of making the yuan more ''flexible.''
Distant_Evaluation	Chinese officials frequently refer to flexibility in describing a willingness to see more intraday volatility in the yuan, which remains tightly linked to the dollar.
Distant_Evaluation	But that does not necessarily mean faster appreciation of the yuan.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Raising interest rates, a conventional cure for asset speculation, runs the risk of attracting even more foreign investment to China.
Cause_General	The People's Bank of China has raised interest rates only four times in the last 13 months, while also raising eight times the percentage of assets that commercial banks must keep as reserves at the central bank.
Distant_Evaluation	Partly because the People's Bank of China does not have nearly the same independence as the Federal Reserve and partly because Chinese economic policy makers have shunned the celebrity surrounding many of their overseas counterparts, Mr. Zhou has not attracted as much attention as Mr. Greenspan.
Distant_Evaluation	But now he is the subject of a guessing game about possible successors -- and about the extent to which career jockeying may make public officials leery of unpopular decisions.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The most commonly cited potential governors are Shang Fulin, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission; Guo Shuqing, Communist Party secretary of the China Construction Bank; and Wu Xiaoling, who is the central bank's senior deputy governor but at 60 may already be deemed too old to succeed Mr. Zhou.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Zhou was president of China Construction Bank and then chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission before taking over leadership of the central bank, so Mr. Shang and Mr. Guo could each be viewed as possibly following in his footsteps.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As for Mr. Zhou himself, he is cited by some experts as a contender to rise as high as deputy prime minister of China -- if he can stay popular a few more months.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But a possible slump in the stock market could hurt Mr. Zhou's future prospects -- even if damage to the broader economy may be limited.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some experts, like Jonathan Anderson, the chief Asia economist at UBS, suggest that because the rising stock market seems to have had little effect on the rate of economic growth over the last year and a half, it may not have much effect going down.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's very hard indeed to see where the negative growth impact would come from,'' he said in a research report on Thursday, noting that equities form a tenth of total household and business wealth in China.
Distant_Anecdotal	As he left a Shanghai brokerage firm on Wednesday, Wang Jianping, a 52-year-old driver, said that he invested only his own savings in the stock market and never borrowed to buy shares.
Distant_Anecdotal	''If I make money, that's great -- if I lose money, it won't hurt my quality of life and it will be O.K.,'' he said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''If I don't make money on the investment in my lifetime, I'll leave it to my children and grandchildren.''
Distant_Evaluation	The bigger worry, but much harder to calculate, lies in whether the country's banks have unintentionally or secretly lent heavily to stock market speculators who would not be able to repay their loans if the market collapsed.
Cause_General	Chinese banking regulations bar banks from issuing margin loans directly to stock market investors.
Cause_General	But banks are allowed to lend to securities firms, which in turn provide margin financing.
Cause_General	State-controlled media have also reported this year that regulators are looking into whether stock speculators are misrepresenting their intentions to banks, claiming that they need loans for real estate or other purposes.
Cause_General	For lack of data, credit analysts have been unable to assess the scale of bank exposure to the stock market.
Distant_Anecdotal	''We can't see it,'' said Charlene Chu, an analyst in the Beijing office of Fitch Ratings, ''on the balance sheets.''
Main	MILAN (Reuters) - Italy’s political crisis risks undoing years spent rebuilding the country’s banks, undermining the value of their assets, choking off access to funding and rekindling euro exit fears.
Distant_Evaluation	Renewed doubts over the single currency have chilled Italy’s bond markets and reawakened the spectre of capital flight that shook Italian banks during the 2011-2012 sovereign crisis.
Main_Consequence	As a result, Italy’s lenders .FTIT8300 have lost more than a fifth of their market value in just two weeks, tracking a fall in its bonds as an anti-establishment coalition sought, and failed, to form a government.
Cause_General	Before the political storm, Italy’s banks had been outperforming euro zone rivals after reducing a bad loan burden that had threatened to cripple them.
Cause_General	And encouraged by Italy’s economic upturn, hedge funds had even piled into the country’s mid-tier lenders, betting on them as the last European recovery play.
Main_Consequence	But the prospect of snap elections after Italy’s president on Sunday vetoed the coalition’s eurosceptic economy minister has deepened a sell-off on fears of a de facto referendum on the euro and a further boost to anti-establishment parties.
Distant_Evaluation	“Risks perceived by investors have risen sharply and that is why they are knocking down the value of Italian banks, which even before the latest turmoil traded below their book values,” said Andrea Resti, a professor at Milan’s Bocconi University and an adviser on banking supervision to the European Parliament.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A 2.3 trillion euro public debt pile, the world’s third-largest, poses a direct threat to the banks, which face steep losses on 352 billion euros of domestic bond holdings after Italy’s benchmark yield hit a four-year high.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	PROPERTY HOPE
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Rome’s turmoil could also lift returns demanded by buyers of the bad loans banks are desperately striving to rid themselves of, stalling sales and forcing them to offer bigger discounts.
Cause_General	The Bank of Italy forecast on Tuesday 65 billion euros in sales of impaired bank loans this year and urged lenders to press ahead with cutting soured debt.
Cause_General	Despite a 75 billion euro drop from their post-recession peak of 360 billion euros, problem loans in Italy still account for around 14 percent of total bank lending.
Distant_Evaluation	That is twice the level of neighboring Spain where the clean-up process has been much faster thanks to European Union aid, solid economic growth and a rebound in real estate prices.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Claudio Scardovi a managing director at Alix Partners said a lagging property rebound was still likely to draw investors to Italy in the face of real estate bubbles in Britain, the Nordics and to some degree in France.
Error	Slideshow (2 Images)
Distant_Evaluation	Italy’s real estate market has improved only in large cities such as Milan and Rome, and tourist areas and Francesco Castelli, head of fixed income at Banor Capital, said a continued and more uniform economic expansion was key for the rebound to take a wider grip.
Distant_Evaluation	“A property investment has an at least five-year horizon: just as the economy was growing again there are doubts about its mid-term prospects,” Castelli said.
Cause_General	MID-MARKET MAYHEM
Distant_Evaluation	Mid-sized lenders, such as Banco BPM (BAMI.MI), UBI Banca (UBI.MI) and BPER Banca (EMII.MI), are seen as more vulnerable to the turmoil because they lag big players like Intesa Sanpaolo (ISP.MI) and UniCredit (CRDI.MI) in cutting bad loans.
Main_Consequence	Italy’s 10th-largest bank Credito Valtellinese (PCVI.MI) has been among the worst hit, even though just ahead of the March election it managed to raise eight times its market value in a share sale and gain 35 percent in value in its aftermath.
Main_Consequence	Shares in Creval, which has one of the highest sovereign exposures relative to its capital and a high bad loan burden, are 11 percent below the 0.10 euros at which it sold new shares.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Analysts warn that smaller Italian lenders are also the most at risk from rising financing costs.
Main_Consequence	Wholesale funding markets have effectively shut down for Italian banks and traders say they will take a long while to reopen.
Cause_General	Italy’s strongest bank Intesa SanPaolo (ISP.MI) placed a 10-year bond IT178534017= after the election at 77 basis points over the swap rate.
Main_Consequence	This now trades with a 200 basis point spread, showing how conditions have worsened.
Distant_Evaluation	Although tight funding markets are not an immediate concern because most banks are awash with liquidity, they do raise a question mark over plans by state-owned Monte dei Paschi di Siena (BMPS.MI) and smaller rival Banca Carige (CRGI.MI) to rebuild their Tier 2 capital buffers with hybrid debt.
Distant_Evaluation	Carige CEO Paolo Fiorentino said on Tuesday that political risks had paralyzed markets when asked about the bank’s plan to issue a subordinated bond, a spokeswoman for the bank said.
Cause_General	Monte dei Paschi declined to comment.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Allen, currently head of customer interactions within the bank’s retail division, will start her new role by the end of the year, subject to regulatory approval, the London-based financial services provider said.
Distant_Evaluation	MANY investors have been heeding market strategists' advice to reduce portfolio risk by putting more money into stable, high-quality, dividend-paying stocks.
Main	But instead of plowing this money into large-capitalization companies based in the United States, investors have redirected much of it into shares of blue-chip foreign companies based largely in Western Europe and Japan.
Cause_Specific	Indeed, foreign large-cap blend funds -- which primarily invest in blue-chip growth and value stocks in developed markets -- were the most popular category of funds through the first 11 months of 2006, according to the Financial Research Corporation in Boston.
Cause_General	Foreign large-blend funds attracted $43.8 billion of net new money during this stretch.
Cause_General	By comparison, highflying diversified emerging-market stock funds attracted $6.6 billion and domestic large-blend funds drew $4 billion, according to Financial Research.
Distant_Evaluation	But does investing in blue chips abroad achieve the same results for a portfolio as investing in big, high-quality domestic stocks?
Distant_Evaluation	The answer is still no, given the currency risks that you inevitably take on when investing abroad.
Distant_Evaluation	Yet a growing number of people argue that foreign and domestic stocks are becoming more alike, given the increased correlation among the world's markets.
Cause_General	Since 1970, for example, the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE index, for European, Australian and Far Eastern stocks, has returned 11.6 percent a year, on average.
Cause_General	That is nearly identical to the annualized gain of 11.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of domestic blue chips.
Distant_Evaluation	But keep in mind that those slightly higher gains came with slightly higher risk, as foreign stocks on their own are still more volatile than domestic equities.
Distant_Evaluation	Sometimes, a modest dose of a risky asset can make an entire portfolio less volatile.
Cause_General	From 1970 to 2005, a 100 percent stock portfolio invested in the S.& P. 500 would have earned 11.1 percent, annualized, according to S.& P. And that is with a so-called standard deviation -- a popular measure of volatility -- of 16.8.
Cause_General	But by moving 25 percent of that money from the S.& P. 500 to the EAFE index, the portfolio would have earned 11.4 percent a year, on average, with a slightly lower standard deviation of 16.4.
Cause_General	Add too much, however, and more volatility enters the mix.
Cause_General	In this case, had 75 percent of the equity stake been invested in the EAFE index and 25 percent in the S.& P. 500, the portfolio would have earned the same 11.4 percent, annualized, from 1970 to 2005.
Cause_General	But the portfolio's volatility would have shot up to 19.1.
Distant_Evaluation	This shows that while the global markets may be moving more in sync, ''the world markets aren't completely integrated yet,'' said James D. Peterson, vice president of the Schwab Center for Investment Research in San Francisco.
Cause_General	Consider the recent performance of foreign and domestic blue chips.
Cause_General	Over the last five years, the average foreign large-blend fund returned 13.8 percent a year, on average, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracker, as many foreign economies have grown faster than that of the United States and as the dollar has weakened of late.
Cause_General	By comparison, domestic large-cap blend funds advanced only 6.3 percent a year, on average, during this stretch.
Cause_General	And last year, foreign blue-chip funds soared 25.1 percent, beating the returns of domestic blue-chip funds by more than 10 percentage points.
Cause_Specific	Arguably, much of the investor interest in foreign blue chips can be attributed to their outperformance, not to their similarities to their domestic counterparts.
Distant_Anecdotal	''A lot of people just want to be exposed to foreign because it's been doing so well,'' said Ronald W. Rogé, a financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y. ''It's performance chasing.''
Cause_General	To be sure, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the EAFE index has been 0.8 over the last three years, according to Morningstar.
Cause_General	On paper, that is fairly high, because a correlation of 1.0 implies that two assets are moving in perfect tandem.
Cause_General	But consider that over this same stretch, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the Russell 2000 index of small domestic stocks was actually greater, 0.83, according to Morningstar.
Distant_Evaluation	Yet investors take it on faith that large-cap and small-cap stocks are entirely different asset classes.
Distant_Evaluation	There are several reasons for continuing to treat foreign and domestic blue-chip stocks separately.
Distant_Evaluation	''A big reason is the issue of currency,'' Mr. Peterson said.
Distant_Evaluation	Investors who put money to work in a foreign market should consider that market's volatility, as well as that of the currency in which its stocks trade.
Cause_General	In 2006, the EAFE index rose 13.8 percent when measured in local currencies, according to MSCI.
Cause_General	But for Americans to make an investment abroad, money must first be converted from dollars to those local currencies to buy the securities.
Cause_General	And when it comes time to sell, the money has to be reconverted back into dollars.
Cause_General	In dollar terms, the EAFE index actually returned much more last year: 23.5 percent.
Cause_General	That is because the dollar lost value against the euro.
Distant_Evaluation	A weakening dollar is a tailwind for Americans investing abroad because each share of their foreign stock becomes worth that much more in dollars.
Distant_Evaluation	SO isn't this good news for domestic investors?
Distant_Evaluation	It certainly was last year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But what happens if the dollar turns around this year and appreciates, as it did in 2005?
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In that case, investors could see a big chunk of their foreign stock market gains evaporate -- even if the global stock markets are highly correlated -- simply because the dollar gained value.
Distant_Evaluation	This is one reason that investors should always assess several factors in the risk and return of a particular stock, said Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a principal in the investment counseling and research department at the Vanguard Group.
Distant_Evaluation	These include its industry, its value or growth orientation, its market cap and the region where it operates.
Distant_Evaluation	''While issues of style and cap size are always important, in many cases they would be secondary to geographic regions,'' Mr. Kinniry said, because stocks will always be affected by their regional economies and local currencies.
Distant_Evaluation	In other words, while geography may not be as important a subject as it used to be for investors, it is still one to be studied.

Main	NEW YORK, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks started off the first week of 2019 on an upbeat note as investors restored some confidence amid vertiginous ups and downs in stock prices, positive Fed signals and a batch of economic data.
Main	In the week ending Jan. 4, the Dow rallied 1.69 percent, the S&P 500 was up 1.93 percent, and the Nasdaq gained 2.45 percent.
Cause_General	The equities continued their weekly gain following the first December weekly gain last week, but are still on course to a strenuous recovery from their worst monthly performance in December since 1931.
Distant_Evaluation	This week marked capricious trading sessions for the market.
Cause_General	On Friday, the three major indices ended higher, closing out the week positively after sharp gains offset sudden losses.
Cause_General	Friday notched solid gains throughout the day, as tech stocks surged, job market retained strength and U.S. Federal Reserve chair hinted at slower monetary tightening.
Cause_Specific	The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 746.94 points dramatically higher on Friday, marking its biggest daily rebound in the week.
Cause_Specific	The S&P 500 jumped up 85.05 points, posting its biggest intraday reversal in the week.
Cause_Specific	The Nasdaq Composite Index surged 275.35 points, also winning its biggest intraday turnaround in the week.
Cause_General	Rebounds in the tech sector on the final trading day this week eroded some of the deep slumps of U.S. stocks bore in previous sessions.
Cause_General	Shares of major tech giants and trade-related multinationals extended gains, including Netflix, Tesla, Intel, and Boeing.
Cause_General	The information technology sector has frequently led the winners in the 11 primary sectors, most of which rallied in the week except Thursday.
Cause_General	U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell quelled growing market fears on Friday in the wake of Apple's slash of quarterly revenue forecast on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	Powell stressed Fed officials are patient and keeping a close eye on the voices of financial market, calling Fed policy as flexible and clung to real-time economic developments.
Distant_Evaluation	"""As always, there is no preset path for policy,"" Powell said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""And particularly with muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Tang Yao, an associate professor of applied economics at Peking University, has predicted that the Fed would continue to send dovish signals and likely reduce interest rate hikes later this year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""If it happens, the market will see a combination of 'no rate hikes/decreases plus declining stocks' in the future,"" Tang told Xinhua, adding that downside risks for equities markets came from investors' expectations of slowing growth and high valuation of U.S. stocks."
Distant_Evaluation	Thursday was a day to mourn for Wall Street due to broad losses in the wake of Apple's dire slash of its first-quarter revenue forecast, which had fuelled persistent anxieties over ebbing global economic growth.
Cause_General	The Dow plunged more than 600 points, or 2.83 percent.
Cause_General	The S&P 500 slumped 62.14 points, or 2.48 percent.
Cause_General	The Nasdaq plummeted 202.43 points, or 3.04 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	Apple downwardly revised revenue forecast in the first quarter in fiscal 2019 on Thursday, and blamed China for the shortfall due to declining sales, as well as shrinking retail stores and channel partners across the country.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Analysts said that trade tensions between the U.S. and China could take an increasing toll on companies in both nations.
Distant_Evaluation	Meanwhile, weakness in emerging market currencies, caused by the stronger U.S. dollar, would also undermine Apple's global sales.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Weakness in emerging market (EM) currencies, such as India's, Turkey's and Russia's, also weighed on sales and forced Apple to raise prices, curbing demand."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"This could have broader implications for U.S. firms with outsized EM revenue,"" UBS Global Wealth Management said Thursday in a research note."
Cause_General	Wall Street also digested a slew of key economic data.
Cause_General	Stronger-than expected employment data helped regain steam for the U.S. economy on Friday.
Cause_General	Total nonfarm payroll employment increased by 312,000 in December, beating a market expectation of 176,000 jobs, said the Bureau of Labor Statistics under Labor Department on Friday.
Cause_General	The ISM manufacturing index, indicating expansion pace of economic activity in the manufacturing sector, dipped to 54.1 in December, its lowest level since November 2016, which was weaker than market expectations, according to a report by the U.S. management association Institute for Supply Management.
Cause_General	The number of weekly jobless claims, or Americans applying for unemployment benefits, reached 231,000 with a seasonally adjusted increase of 10,000 for the week ending Dec. 29, said the U.S. Labor Department on Thursday.
Cause_General	The seasonally adjusted IHS Markit final U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) posted 53.8 in December, down from 55.3 in November, marking a 15-month low of U.S. manufacturing growth, according to the London-based global information provider IHS Markit on Wednesday.

Main	CHICAGO, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) agricultural futures closed much higher on Thursday, with soybeans posting more gains amid dry weather that has prevailed in parts of Brazil and hopes for new purchases by China.
Cause_Specific	Dry weather conditions are reportedly impacting more than a third of Brazil's soybean and corn growing area, pushing up the CBOT futures in the past two days.
Cause_General	CBOT soybeans, following a brief overnight retreat on profit-taking, returned to the positive territory and posted more gains, along with U.S.-China trade optimism, even after a partial shutdown of the U.S. federal government has made it difficult for traders to follow official export sales reports.
Cause_Specific	Meanwhile, CBOT wheat prices were boosted by technical buying, with the weakening U.S. dollar as an additional supporting factor, said market watchers.
Cause_Specific	At the end of the session, CBOT March corn was up 4 cents, or 1.06 percent to close at 3.7975 U.S. dollars per bushel.
Cause_Specific	March wheat was up 7 cents, or 1.38 percent to settle at 5.1375 dollars.

Distant_Historical	SEOUL (Reuters) - The chief executive of South Korea’s LG Display (034220.KS), Han Sang-beom, was determined to deliver a strong message when he appeared before 1,000 employees at the firm’s main manufacturing plant last spring.

Distant_Historical	So he donned a pair of goggles, picked up a hammer, and smashed a liquid-crystal display screen to bits.
Distant_Evaluation	The symbolism was impossible to miss: LCD panels, the company’s mainstay for years, were being relegated to the industrial dustbin.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The company’s future would depend on a newer technology, organic light-emitting diode, or OLED.
Distant_Evaluation	“I’ve never seen him do such a thing,” said one company official who was present.
Distant_Evaluation	“His performance showed a grim determination to weather this crisis.”
Distant_Evaluation	Yet LG Display’s predicament was in many ways one of its own making.
Distant_Historical	Less than a year earlier, the company had showered employees with perks and bonuses as profits rolled in, driven by the company’s leadership in LCD screens for TVs, computer monitors and smartphones.
Main	But LG Display had misread the market: Chinese competitors were coming on strong, and by early this year prices for LCD screens were plummeting.
Cause_General	The fat profits of 2017 turned into big losses in 2018 - and the company abruptly announced in July that it would slash $2.7 billion in capital spending it had planned through 2020.
Distant_Historical	It did not reveal its total or previous targets but made about $6 billion in capital expenditures in 2017, according to Eikon data.
Distant_Evaluation	The company’s troubles stand as a stark example of the risks inherent in hotly competitive technology businesses that require massive capital investment.
Main	“It seems that LG Display made a major miscalculation on its LCD business, not accurately judging the timing to pull away when they could see China’s rapid catch-up,” said Lee Won-sik, an analyst at Shinyoung Securities.
Distant_Evaluation	“We knew from last year LCD prices would go down but we did not expect this big and fast fall,” acknowledged one LG Display official, who, like others in this article, declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the media.
Distant_Evaluation	“Customers had been asking for price cuts, but we didn’t act until it got too late.”
Cause_General	PRICES IN FREE-FALL
Distant_Historical	LG Display posted five straight years of strong profits after Han took the helm in 2012, riding a tide of LCD screen orders from Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and strong demand for both phone and TV screens from LG Electronics (066570.KS), which owns more than a third of the display-maker.
Distant_Historical	LG Display also began to invest in OLED displays, which unlike LCD screens don’t require backlighting and can deliver more natural-looking colors.
Cause_General	OLED screens also consume less energy and can be bent and folded.
Distant_Historical	But the technology is expensive, and LG Display was earning the vast majority of its revenue from LCDs.
Cause_General	Until its recent cutbacks, it was running eight LCD production lines in South Korea and another in China.
Cause_Specific	While LG Display hummed along, Chinese companies, led by BOE Technology Group Co Ltd (000725.SZ), were pouring huge sums into LCD production.

Distant_Historical	1 supplier of LCDs larger than 9 inches, according to market tracker IHS Markit, taking 22.3 percent of unit shipments versus 21.6 percent for LG Display.
Cause_General	It was the first time a Chinese display maker had taken the top spot.
Distant_Historical	By early 2018, prices for many types of LCDs were in free-fall.
Cause_General	Prices for 50-inch LCD television panels, for example, slid 32 percent in August versus the same month last year, according to IHS Markit.
Distant_Historical	LG Display’s big South Korean rival, the display unit of Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), had begun pulling back from LCD years earlier, shutting down older LCD production lines in South Korea beginning in 2010, according to a Samsung Display official.
Cause_General	The company now has just two LCD factories in South Korea and one in China.
Main_Consequence	But LG Display was caught flat-footed and is now furiously slashing LCD capacity.
Main_Consequence	It has closed three LCD production lines since last year and abandoned plans for a new one.
Distant_Historical	The company in April also rolled out an “emergency management system,” with employees being told to use cheaper flights and cut back on group meals, company sources told Reuters.
Cause_General	Cash flow has become a concern: it was negative 838.2 billion won ($743.93 million) in the second quarter, according to Eikon data, and has been negative for three straight quarters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Three company sources say the company is not planning layoffs for fear of losing talent to China, but some employees are frustrated with cuts in benefits.
Distant_Evaluation	“Executives are trying to keep the morale up, telling us media reports about a voluntary redundancy program are false,” a company source with knowledge of the matter said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	OLED A GAME CHANGER?
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	LG Display is now betting the house on OLED, and says it can fund $17.6 billion in OLED investments over the next three years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It expects the newer technology to account for 40 percent of revenue by 2020, up from just 10 percent today.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As OLED becomes more prevalent, LG Display’s fortunes could turn, analysts say.
Distant_Evaluation	LG Display’s OLED panels have helped its sibling, LG Electronics, take the lead in high-end televisions.
Distant_Evaluation	Some analysts believe LG Display has been pressured to supply those panels cheaply, hurting its profitability, though the company denies that is the case.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But the OLED market promises to be tough.
Cause_General	Samsung boasts that it has been investing in OLED since 2005.
Cause_General	BOE is getting into OLED too.
Distant_Evaluation	LG Display has costly process for durable OLED TVs, but there are no better alternatives, said Ross Young, chief executive of research provider Display Supply Chain Consultants.
Distant_Evaluation	“LG Display’s current approach is the best solution for the market,” Young said.
Distant_Evaluation	Son Young-jun, LG Display’s vice president of public relations, said in a statement that the company is the only producer of large-size OLED displays and had “unmatched technological expertise” in OLED.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The potential and outlook ahead is promising,” he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	LG Display says its OLED division will turn a profit in the third quarter.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It also expects LCD prices to stabilize, enabling it to squeeze profits from the older technology until the newer one matures.
Distant_Evaluation	“Given OLED is our answer and solution to the crisis, there’s nothing else we can do other than tightening our belts and pushing for OLED,” a company official said.

Main	KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia intends to recover all funds illicitly taken from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), and determine whether there are grounds for claims against companies, including Goldman Sachs (GS.N), that profited from dealing with the beleaguered state fund.

Distant_Evaluation	Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that a plan was “on the table” to ask all individuals and political parties to return money that came from 1MDB, which was allegedly used as a slush fund by former prime minister Najib Razak.
Cause_Specific	Having defeated his former protege in an election last month, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad’s administration has launched an investigation into how the fund founded by Najib lost billions of dollars.
Cause_General	Najib has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and repeated earlier this week that he did not benefit or steal money from 1MDB.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lim said the government would also scrutinize the $600 million paid in fees to Goldman Sachs for raising nearly $6.5 billion in three bond sales between 2012 and 2013 for 1MDB.
Distant_Evaluation	Critics said the fees earned from those bond issues were far in excess of the normal 1-2 percent fees a bank could expect.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We will be looking at the possibility of seeking claims from Goldman Sachs, where there are grounds to do so... definitely,” Lim told Reuters in an interview.
Cause_General	Reuters had reported last week that according to sources familiar with the issue Malaysia is considering asking the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) to get Goldman Sachs to return fees earned from the bond issues.
Distant_Historical	Civil lawsuits filed in 2016 by the DOJ alleged that over $2.5 billion raised from those bonds were misappropriated by high-level 1MDB officials, their relatives and associates.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He also said Malaysia will look at the conduct of other banks involved in 1MDB transactions.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’ve got to see the nexus, whether they were at fault.”
Distant_Evaluation	Lim said the United Malay National Organisation (UMNO), the party Najib had led until his election defeat, and from which Mahathir resigned in order to join the opposition, was not the only party to have received 1MDB money.
Distant_Evaluation	“To be fair, UMNO is not the only political party that received money,” Lim said.
Distant_Evaluation	“Those who have taken money from 1MDB, should return it to the country.”
Cause_General	INTERNATIONAL EFFORT
Cause_General	Lim said the DOJ and enforcement agencies in several other countries were giving strong cooperation to Malaysia’s efforts to recoup 1MDB funds, and bring prosecutions.
Distant_Evaluation	A proposal to monetize assets acquired using 1MDB funds that U.S. authorities are looking to seize under its anti-kleptocracy program was an option under consideration, Lim said.
Cause_General	The DOJ is seeking to seize $1.7 billion in assets allegedly bought with funds stolen from 1MDB, including a Picasso painting, shares in a Hollywood production company, a yacht and nearly $200 million in jeweler.
Cause_Specific	Last month, Malaysian police said that cash worth 114 million ringgit ($28.6 million), jewelry and over 400 luxury handbags were seized from several apartments linked to Najib, as part of their probe into 1MDB.
Cause_General	Lim said his ministry is also investigating several “highly suspicious” deals made by Najib’s administration to determine if they were carried out to help pay for 1MDB dues.
Cause_General	He declined to identify the deals, but said Malaysia was investigating state-run palm oil agency Felda’s $500 million acquisition of a non-controlling stake in Indonesia’s PT Eagle High Plantations Tbh (BWPT.JK).
Distant_Evaluation	He did not say if the Felda deal, which was criticized for being expensive, was linked to 1MDB.
Cause_Specific	Last month, the finance ministry said about $500 million raised from a land sale by the government to the central bank, along with funds from sovereign wealth fund Khazanah Nasional, were used to pay 1MDB’s liabilities in 2017.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lim said the government will have to pay an estimated 50 billion ringgit in debts and interest accumulated by 1MDB.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are forced to pay that much against our will,” Lim said, adding that the government has sufficient funds, but may consider restructuring debt to clear 1MDB’s dues if it can secure better yields.

Distant_Evaluation	As the court-appointed guardian and self-described fixer of some of America's most wayward companies, Richard C. Breeden, the former top securities regulator, is considered a pillar of corporate ethics and governance.
Main	Now he trying to become another paragon -- that of savvy investor in troubled companies.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And in the coming months he will face his first major test: taking on the Applebee's International restaurant chain in a proxy fight.
Cause_General	Mr. Breeden's fledgling advocacy hedge fund, Breeden Partners, which owns a 5.2 percent stake in Applebee's, began its battle last month, when Mr. Breeden nominated four close friends to its board.
Distant_Evaluation	Hedge funds, the lucrative private investment pools for institutions like endowments and pensions, and for the wealthy, are nearly always managed by former Wall Street traders or money managers.
Cause_General	Mr. Breeden -- a Harvard-trained securities lawyer -- has no investing experience.
Main	But he is seeking to bring his knowledge of securities laws and corporate governance into investing in underperforming companies.
Distant_Evaluation	Some in the business are skeptical.
Distant_Evaluation	''I guess I wonder, how does a guy with no investment management experience run a hedge fund?''
Distant_Evaluation	asked Philip Goldstein of Bulldog Investors, which runs hedge funds similar in style and intent to that of Mr. Breeden.
Distant_Evaluation	''You get the guys leaving Goldman Sachs and raising $2 billion, but this is even more astonishing -- he doesn't have a track record.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Goldstein added that ''it's kind of like starting at the top -- you'd think you'd want to work at a hedge fund for a while.''
Distant_Evaluation	But what Mr. Breeden may lack in investing experience, he makes up for in other ways, according to his friends, who cite his hard-driving nature, his intellect, his attention to detail and his decisiveness, if marred at times by a divalike attitude.
Distant_Anecdotal	''If it's a bad idea, Richard will kick it down the toilet and flush,'' said Laurence E. Harris, a lawyer in Washington who is one of four close friends that Mr. Breeden nominated last month to the board of directors at Applebee's, with a view to gaining a say in how the company is run.
Distant_Anecdotal	Mr. Breeden ''knows what to look for,'' Mr. Harris said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''He's a lot less likely to be fooled than a lot of people who are pure investors, because he understands the mechanics of corporate governance and securities laws.''
Cause_General	Mr. Breeden, 57, declined to comment for this article.
Distant_Historical	He has not only has a new professional life, but a new personal one as well.
Distant_Historical	Last year, Mr. Breeden married a trust administrator of the Bennett Funding Group, which he had overseen as the court-appointed monitor.
Distant_Historical	(He and his first wife, Holly, were divorced in 2005 after 27 years of marriage.)
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Breeden is now perhaps the most senior former government official ever to run a hedge fund.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Breeden oversaw the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1989 to 1993.
Distant_Historical	He then ran one of the world's largest accounting firms, Coopers & Lybrand, before establishing his private firm, Richard C. Breeden & Company, in Greenwich, Conn., to advise companies hobbled by ethics and governance problems.
Distant_Historical	In recent years, he has served as the high-profile outside monitor for scandal-plagued firms like WorldCom, which filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and Conrad Black's former company, Hollinger International.
Cause_Specific	It was when he was overseeing the bankruptcy of WorldCom, later MCI, that Mr. Breeden first began thinking about starting a hedge fund, according to friends and associates.
Distant_Anecdotal	Seeing the roles played by the Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim Helú and Mark Neporent of the hedge fund Cerberus Capital as investors in MCI, he asked Mr. Harris, ''I'm thinking of starting a hedge fund -- what do you think?''
Distant_Anecdotal	Mr. Harris, who recalled the conversation, said Mr. Breeden told him, ''The one thing I don't want to do is fail.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Breeden's right-hand man at Breeden Partners is his friend Steven J. Quamme, a one-time mergers-and-acquisitions lawyer with whom Mr. Breeden once worked at Baker Botts, the Washington law firm.
Distant_Anecdotal	When asked who was running the hedge fund -- in other words, picking companies in which to invest, Mr. Harris replied, ''I don't think you can actually separate Richard and Steve -- they're joined at the hip.''
Cause_General	Mr. Quamme did not return calls requesting comment.
Distant_Historical	An entrepreneur as well as an investor, Mr. Quamme has picked some winners in his past jobs, including a chain of video stores that was sold to Blockbuster Video early last decade and a chunk of the Einstein Brothers Bagels franchises.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Quamme, whom Mr. Breeden also nominated to serve on the Applebee's board, has also endured some setbacks.
Distant_Historical	His 50 percent stake in Boston Chicken, through Mayfair Partners, an investing partnership that he ran in the mid-1990s, went stale in 1998 when the restaurant and the partnership both filed for bankruptcy.
Distant_Evaluation	It is, of course, far too early to tell whether Mr. Breeden's knowledge and experience will make his hedge fund, whose philosophy is to invest in American companies with fixable problems in policy and governance, a winner.
Distant_Evaluation	Some analysts do not see his fund making an impact on Applebee's.
Distant_Evaluation	''We do not see a dramatic shift near-term in the company's strategic direction that would lead to the 'value creating' programs proposed by the activist,'' Andrew Barish, an analyst with Banc of America Securities wrote earlier this month.
Cause_General	Applebee's declined to comment on Mr. Breeden's proposals.
Cause_General	The fund sought to raise $1.25 billion but has so far brought in only around $500 million, including $400 million from Calpers, the California pension fund.
Distant_Historical	The hedge fund earned 7.73 percent in the third quarter of 2006, according to the most recent available data from Calpers.
Distant_Evaluation	To some, Mr. Breeden's leap into the hedge fund business on the heels of serving as a court-appointed monitor for so many large companies raises questions.

Distant_Evaluation	''I'm disappointed that he is doing this.''
Cause_General	Mr. Breeden's spokesmen declined to answer questions on whether Breeden Partners would prohibit itself from investing in companies for which Mr. Breeden had served as a court-appointed monitor.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And the transparency that Mr. Breeden championed at the troubled companies he has overseen may go by the wayside with his new venture.

Distant_Evaluation	BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Opposition politicians and many ordinary Argentines have been quick to criticize President Mauricio Macri’s decision to seek a lifeline from the International Monetary Fund but the gamble could pay off if he is able to avoid onerous terms.

Cause_Specific	Macri and IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde announced on Tuesday they were opening talks for a financing deal after Argentina’s peso currency touched a new low of 23.5 to the dollar, despite tighter fiscal measures and hiking interest rates up to 40 percent in Latin America’s third-largest economy.
Distant_Evaluation	On Wednesday, the Treasury Ministry announced it would seek a stand-by deal’ from the IMF, a type of financing that would likely require more conditions and orthodox policy reforms than a Flexible Credit Line (FCL), such as the more stable economies of Mexico and Colombia have.
Distant_Evaluation	For many, the announcement brought back memories of a 2001-2002 financial crisis that many blamed on IMF policy prescriptions adopted by the government.
Distant_Historical	The crisis was punctuated by a debt default and currency devaluation that tossed millions of middle-class Argentines into poverty.
Distant_Evaluation	Opposition politicians, particularly those allied with leftist former President Cristina Fernandez, were quick to denounce the deal, placing “IMF OUT!” signs on their desks in Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	“Every time Argentina turns to the International Monetary Fund it has been followed by very bad news for Argentina,” Agustin Rossi, head of Fernandez’s party in the lower house, said on Wednesday.
Main	In a sign Macri’s government was pressing ahead with its agenda despite the crisis, the Congress passed a long-awaited capital markets reform law quicker than expected on Wednesday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But the lower house of Congress was also expected to pass an opposition bid to limit price increases by utilities, following a reduction in government subsidies to help reduce the budget deficit.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The government has said it would veto the bill, which has contributed to market jitters, if it passes both houses.
Main_Consequence	The Merval stock index closed up 6.5 percent after the capital markets bill passed.
Cause_General	It had lost 12 percent in the previous five trading sessions.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If, by resorting to the IMF, the government manages to stabilize the situation, then the political cost of having this unexpected guest back again may be short-lived,” said Ignacio Labaqui, who analyses Argentina for risk consultancy Medley Global Advisors.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	RE-ELECTION BID
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If the IMF lifeline continues to calm markets and does not dramatically change Macri’s agenda, his gamble on seeking assistance could bear dividends.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He will have re-established ties to the Fund in time for the political fallout to settle before his expected 2019 re-election campaign.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But if it fails to restore confidence or requires draconian austerity measures, Macri’s appeal to the IMF could jeopardize his ability to win a second term.
Distant_Evaluation	“The government is aware of the costs.
Distant_Evaluation	It is a step they would have preferred not to take.
Distant_Evaluation	They are running the risk of deepening the decline in popularity,” said Juan Cruz Diaz, managing director of Cefeidas Group, a political risk consultancy in Buenos Aires.
Distant_Evaluation	“But this is the moment to make these difficult decisions.”
Cause_Specific	Macri was driven back to the IMF by a perfect storm including a free-falling peso and an economy hobbled by one of the world’s highest inflation rates, running at around 25 percent.
Cause_General	The peso closed 0.53 percent weaker on Wednesday following several days of turmoil that prompted the central bank to increase interest rates on Friday and the government to cut its fiscal deficit target to 2.7 percent of gross domestic product.
Cause_General	Market nerves were strained by a new tax the government slapped on foreign investors last month.
Cause_General	Investors had already been shying away from emerging markets generally, ahead of expected further tightening by the U.S. Federal Reserve, which hit currencies across Latin America.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On the streets of Buenos Aires, many Argentines were apprehensive the IMF could once again impose a straitjacket on their country, after the spectacular failure of its policies 17 years earlier.

Cause_General	According to a survey taken by polling firm D’Alessio IROL/Berensztein last weekend, 75 percent of respondents said they would not support a government request for assistance from the IMF.
Cause_General	That included 58 percent of those who voted for Macri’s ‘Let’s Change’ coalition in the 2015 elections.
Cause_General	Thousands of union members and supporters of Fernandez and other opposition parties rallied outside Congress on Wednesday evening in protest of Macri’s business-friendly policy reforms, and the IMF’s re-involvement in Argentina.

Main	COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danske Bank (DANSKE.CO) faced a new Danish money laundering inquiry on Thursday as political anger spread over a scandal involving 200 billion euros ($234 billion) in payments, many of which were suspicious, through Estonia.
Error	FILE PHOTO: Danske Bank sign is seen at the bank's Estonian branch in Tallinn, Estonia August 3, 2018.
Error	REUTERS/Ints Kalnins/File Photo
Cause_Specific	Chief Executive Thomas Borgen resigned on Wednesday after an investigation commissioned by Danske Bank exposed control and compliance failings, fuelling calls for more stringent European Union rules after several such scandals.
Cause_Specific	The bank’s report sparked vocal political criticism and prompted Denmark’s Financial Services Authority (FSA) to revisit a case which it had put on ice earlier this year, but is reported to have attracted the attention of U.S. authorities.
Main	“We’re reopening the investigation of the bank that we initially closed in May,” FSA head Jesper Berg told Danish broadcaster TV2.
Distant_Historical	In May an FSA report said it had found “serious weaknesses” in the bank’s governance and demanded reforms, as well imposing reprimands and a higher capital requirement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Berg said the FSA would use the new information from Danske Bank’s report and focus on identifying a legal responsibility.
Cause_Specific	In an indication of the penalties such lapses can entail, Dutch financial group ING (INGA.AS) agreed to pay 775 million euros this month after money laundering through its accounts.
Distant_Evaluation	One of the main factors behind a dramatic fall in Danske Bank’s share price this year is investor concern that it could have broken U.S. sanctions, which could entail billions of dollars in penalties.
Distant_Evaluation	Danske Bank said on Wednesday it had not so far found any breach of sanctions, while Chairman Ole Andersen said it had assessed whether it had violated U.S. laws, but declined to share its conclusion.
Distant_Evaluation	While authorities in the United States have yet to say whether they are investigating the payments, many of which came from Russia and other former Soviet states, Danske Bank’s case is already high on the agenda of European Union members.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	European Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said on Thursday she will discuss the Danske Bank case with the finance ministers of Denmark, Finland and Estonia on October 2.
Distant_Evaluation	“I want to understand better where the main errors happened, whether it was purely the fault of the lack of due diligence done by the bank itself or whether there was also some mistakes at the level of supervisory authorities,” she said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Jourova told a news conference in Brussels that she will also discuss the case with the European Banking Authority to see if supervisory mistakes were made.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And in a sign of investor concern, Brussels-based consultancy firm Deminor Recovery Service said it would seek shareholder backing for an impartial investigation of the case at Danske Bank’s annual general meeting in March.
Distant_Evaluation	“STRIKING FAILURE”
Distant_Evaluation	Danish prime minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen voiced his concern over the failings exposed by the country’s biggest lender, saying he was “shocked” at the scope of the suspicious payments and pushed the bank for more answers.
Distant_Evaluation	“The fact that Denmark has been at the center of money laundering of this size is frankly quite horrible,” Rasmussen said outside a meeting of European Union leaders in Salzburg.
Cause_General	Danske Bank already faces a criminal investigation after the Danish state prosecutor for financial crime said in August it had started its own inquiry.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The case doesn’t end with this,” the PM said in reference to Wednesday’s report from Danske Bank.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Danish politicians, who are scrambling to show they take the problem seriously, agreed on a new anti-money laundering law this week that will include an eight-fold increase in the size of fines, making it one of the toughest in Europe.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s a striking management failure,” Jeppe Kofod, who chairs the European Parliament’s special committee on financial crimes, tax evasion and tax avoidance, told Reuters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The responsible people should be fired to show that such a failure has consequences,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	Danske Bank said it had taken action against former and current staff, but in Denmark, which regularly features in surveys as one of the world’s least corrupt countries, politicians were critical of it for not revealing how much money may have been laundered or who held legal responsibility.
Distant_Evaluation	Business minister Rasmus Jarlov said that Denmark wanted to avoid a scenario like the one in Latvia where ABLV was accused by U.S. authorities of covering up money laundering, leading to the bank being denied U.S. dollar funding and collapsing.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We’re dealing with it here, and we crack down hard on money laundering, and we hope this is being noticed abroad,” he said.
Main	(Reuters) - Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said on Thursday it would stop producing its Beetle compact car in 2019, ending a model that looked backward to the 1960s counterculture as the automaker prepares for a leap toward a future of mass-market electric cars.
Distant_Evaluation	The original VW Beetle, developed in the 1930s, made a journey from a product identified with Adolf Hitler to a symbol of Germany’s rebirth as a democratic, industrial powerhouse after World War Two.
Distant_Historical	In the 1960s, the Beetle was a small-is-beautiful icon of the postwar baby boom generation.
Cause_General	Volkswagen discontinued U.S. sales of the “bug” in 1979, but continued production for Mexico and Latin America.
Distant_Historical	In the mid-1990s, at a time when Volkswagen was struggling to rekindle sales in the United States, then-Chief Executive Ferdinand Piech pushed to revive and modernize the distinctive Beetle design pioneered by his grandfather, Ferdinand Porsche.
Distant_Historical	The result was a crescent-shaped car called the “New Beetle,” launched in 1998, which offered playful touches such as a built-in flower vase.
Cause_Specific	The New Beetle was a hit during its early years, with sales of more than 80,000 in the United States in 1999, but recently the car’s U.S. sales have suffered along with most other small cars.
Cause_General	Overall, VW has sold about 500,000 Beetles globally since 1998, the company said.
Cause_General	Volkswagen sold a total of 11,151 Beetles in the United States through the first eight months of 2018, down 2.2 percent from the same period a year earlier.
Distant_Evaluation	U.S. consumers looking for a small Volkswagen vehicle overwhelmingly prefer the Jetta sedan, or a Tiguan compact sport utility vehicle.
Cause_General	The Jetta, Tiguan and Beetle are built for North America and other markets at a factory in Mexico.
Distant_Evaluation	The end of the Beetle comes at a turning point for Volkswagen.
Cause_General	The German automaker’s last three years have been rocked by the fallout from a scandal caused by its admitted cheating on diesel emissions tests.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Now, Volkswagen is gearing up to launch a wave of electric vehicles to appeal to a new generation of environmentally conscious consumers - children and grandchildren of the 1960s Beetle enthusiasts.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In a statement announcing the end of the Beetle, Hinrich Woebcken, head of Volkswagen of America, said that as the company ramps up its electrification strategy, there are no plans to replace the Beetle.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, his statement did not rule that out someday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He noted the company’s I.D.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Buzz, a prototype for a 21st Century reincarnation of the microbus.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The automaker has said it intends to put a vehicle similar to the I.D.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Buzz into production as an electric vehicle.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The company said two special Beetle models will join the final lineup - Final Edition SE and Final Edition SEL - in the United States and would offer driver-assistance technology.
Main	(Reuters) - The S&P 500’s three-company telecommunications services index .SPLRCL is about to be folded into a much higher-profile group, but a brighter spotlight may not be enough to boost the stocks as investors continue to favor growth sectors.

Main	The three telecom stocks - Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), AT&T Inc (T.N) and CenturyLink Inc (CTL.N) - will be included a newly-minted S&P 500 Communications Services Sector on Monday, along with high-flyers including Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) and Facebook Inc (FB.O).
Cause_General	The telecom sector has been the biggest loser among the S&P’s 11 major sectors with an 4.4-percent decline so far in 2018, driven by AT&T’s 13.3-percent drop.
Cause_General	In comparison, many of the other companies joining the group have shown strong gains for the year with Netflix rising 91.5 percent, Twitter (TWTR.N) rising 21.7 percent and Alphabet rising 10.8 percent.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	To be sure, passive investors will end up with telecom exposure by default if they invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that mirror the new communications index.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But many active investors may still ignore telecom stocks, which are typically viewed as defensive investments because of slower, though relatively predictable, growth rates and high dividends.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Instead, they may look to faster-growing internet or media companies for exposure to the growth oriented communications sector.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Telecoms are likely to fade into the background,” according to Patrick Palfrey, equity strategist at Credit Suisse.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Investors aren’t going to look to communications for dividend yield.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They’re going to look to it for businesses that have a tremendous opportunity to grow.”
Cause_General	With interest rates rising and an economic expansion still intact, investors are putting more money into growth sectors than dividend stocks, which tend to do better in times of economic weakness.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And investors looking to balance their portfolio across different sectors with some defensive bets would be unlikely to seek safety in the communications index.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If you wanted to own safety or dividend yield you’d go to real estate investment trusts or utilities.
Distant_Evaluation	Those sectors are uniformly one theme.
Distant_Evaluation	That’s dividend yield,” said Palfrey.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Wall Street expects the S&P 500 communications sector to generate 21 percent earnings growth and 11.1 percent revenue growth for 2018, compared with 16.7 percent earnings growth and 7.4 percent revenue growth for the telecom stocks, according to data collected by Thomson Reuters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Estimates for the next 12 months imply a trading multiple of 18.4 for the communications sector compared with the telecom sector’s multiple of 10.6, according to Thomson Reuters data.
Error	GRAPHIC: S&P 500 current telecoms - reut.rs/2CHvx6F
Main_Consequence	State Street Global advisors created the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC.P) ETF to mirror the reclassified sector while Vanguard created the Vanguard Communication Services index fund (VOX.P).
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While the new ETFs will give some support to telecom stocks, the decisions of active investors, could have a bigger impact on performance after the reshuffle as passive investments represent a much smaller portion of equity investments.
Distant_Historical	According to a 2017 estimate from BlackRock, less than 18 percent of the global stock market is owned by index-tracking investors.
Cause_General	Growth funds with large-cap investments have been sharply outperforming large-cap value funds with a 16.4-percent increase in value so far in 2018 while value counterparts gained 4.4 percent.
Cause_General	In the last five years, growth funds rose 14.9 percent versus 10 percent for value funds, according to Lipper data.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some stock pickers may take a fresh look at the telephone companies when they join the bigger index, which will make up 10 percent of the S&P 500 compared with the current telecom sector’s a 2 percent weighting, according to Todd Rosenbluth, Director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And value investors seeking high dividends would still opt for telecom stocks over their faster growing counterparts in the sector because they are cheaper, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	But even the strategists who were most hopeful for a boost from the reclassification sounded cautious.
Distant_Evaluation	“Telecoms is probably one of those areas where people have been leaning too heavily on the negative side,” said Sameer Samana, global equity and technical strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute in St. Louis.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s not so much that we like it.
Distant_Evaluation	It may just be a good time to not be as negative on it.”

Main	The group, which owns a $155 billion one-third stake in Chinese technology giant Tencent, unveiled plans on Monday to hive off Multichoice to help close a more than 60 percent discount in its share price to the value of its holding in Tencent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This leaves Multichoice free to fend for itself in an increasingly competitive market where Netflix is already supplying thousands of viewers with original TV content and Hollywood hits such as “Stranger Things” and “House of Cards”.
Cause_Specific	“The intention is to basically have absolutely minimal debt going to Multichoice to provide them with flexibility to make any strategic move they want to make,” said Naspers’ chief executive Bob van Dijk.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We’re not going to suck any cash out of Multichoice.”
Distant_Evaluation	Although streaming is still rare on a continent hobbled by slow internet speeds, reaching fewer than 2 million of sub-Saharan Africa’s billion citizens, it is increasingly challenging more popular satellite-TV services.
Distant_Evaluation	Multichoice’s fledgling internet-streaming service, Showmax, is betting a blend of Hollywood blockbusters and local content such as “Real Househelps of Kawangware” and “The Bachelor South Africa” will set it apart from rivals.
Distant_Historical	It launched Showmax in 2016.
Cause_General	Naspers does not provide subscriber numbers for Showmax, but London-based Digital TV Research estimates it had 334,000 at the end of last year, fewer than half as many as Netflix and mostly in South Africa.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	SHOWMAX
Cause_General	Multichoice had 7.5 billion rand ($503 million) cash at the end of the latest financial disclosure period in March, generated largely from subscription fees of as much as 809 rand a month from some of its 13.5 million households across the continent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The listing of Multichoice Group will create a leading entertainment business on the JSE that is profitable and cash generative,” Patel said in e-mail reply to questions.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The company did not provide details on how it would deploy the money but said its balance sheet would allow it to pursue growth opportunities in African video entertainment and pay a “meaningful dividend” to shareholders.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Analysts also expect it to scale up Showmax.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I expect them to be quite a good dividend paying stock but on the other hand it is an industry that is facing structural change so I expect them to continue to invest in Showmax to defend the position,” said Renier de Bruyn, a portfolio manager at Sanlam Private Wealth.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Multichoice’s dominant position in most of its markets makes it unlikely to seek to acquire rivals.
Cause_General	Founded in 1915, Naspers has transformed itself from an apartheid-era newspaper publisher into a $100 billion behemoth thanks largely to cash flow from Multichoice that enabled it to pursue private-equity style investments in e-commerce platforms across the world.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	According to Digital TV Research the number of pay TV users in sub-Saharan Africa - a region of more than a billion people - is expected to jump by three quarters between 2017 and 2023 to nearly 41 million, with more than half of that signing up for satellite TV offerings.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Over the same period, subscriptions for streaming services - which also include Kwese, Cell C’s Black and Vodacom’s VideoPlay - are forecast to grow more than six-fold to nearly 10 million.
Distant_Evaluation	CUTTING EDGE
Distant_Evaluation	“We’re quite confident.
Distant_Evaluation	The combination of Multichoice’s reach, Showmax and DSTV Now cutting edge internet television services will provide unique and unmatched offering,” said Multichoice Chief Executive Imtiaz Patel.
Cause_General	DSTV Now is an app that allows Multichoice subscribers to live stream channels on the satellite platform.
Distant_Evaluation	The company has invested heavily in infrastructure that allows it to beam television content since its launch more than 20 years ago.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Video offering via satellite is expected to remain at the heart of video entertainment for the majority of Africans for at least the next five years despite a rapid uptake of video on demand offerings from internet streaming services.
Distant_Evaluation	The bulk of internet users rely on mobile phones to connect but hardly use their data to stream videos because of the cost.
Cause_General	In South Africa, for example, a 1GB data bundle costs around 149 rand, a stiff price in a country where the minimum wage is 20 rand an hour.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The listing of Multichoice is likely to fetch between 9 and 12 times its $627 million annual core earnings, or EBITDA, valuing it at least $5.6 billion, bankers and analysts said and making it a blue-chip Top-40 stock on the Johannesburg bourse similar in size to drugmaker Aspen Pharmacare.
Distant_Evaluation	“We endorse this decision.
Cause_General	Naspers recently raised 140 billion rand, twice the size of Multichoice, by selling 2 percent of Tencent and 33 billion rand from the sale of their Flipkart stake,” said Byron Lotter, a portfolio manager at Vestact, which owns shares in Naspers.

Main	The Illinois-based global commodities powerhouse, a major ethanol producer, accounted for roughly 61 percent of the 9.5 million barrels sold at the Chicago hub between November and August, according to the data reviewed by Reuters.
Distant_Historical	Previously, ADM had been a regular buyer: In September and October of last year, for example, ADM bought 810,000 barrels, 32 percent of the 2.495 million total trades in the Chicago hub during that stretch, according to the data.
Cause_General	ADM’s shift came amid an upheaval in the domestic ethanol market as U.S. demand flatlined and export markets, including China and Brazil, were cut off due in part to the effects of President Donald Trump’s widening trade disputes.
Cause_General	With growth in export markets slowing, U.S. ethanol inventories swelled to a record.
Distant_Evaluation	Ethanol traders say ADM is saturating the domestic market, anchoring prices and bleeding out smaller producers less equipped to manage through the tough times.
Distant_Evaluation	ADM spokeswoman Jackie Anderson, when asked about the shift in the company’s strategy, said ADM does not comment on the specifics of its commercial activity.
Cause_General	Ethanol futures prices traded on the Chicago Board of Trade late last month fell to $1.21 per gallon, lowest in over a decade.
Cause_General	Ethanol in Chicago cash markets, meanwhile, were about $1.28 per gallon, just above a low of $1.24 from December, traders told Reuters.
Cause_General	The heavy selling by ADM has led traders who have lost money on the slumping ethanol market to complain to S&P Global Platts, which provides benchmark pricing for the physical ethanol contract at different U.S. delivery points including Chicago.
Distant_Evaluation	In July, Platts hosted an ethanol pricing methodology workshop in Houston at which senior traders from the largest U.S. ethanol trading shops expressed anger about ADM’s influence on the market, according to several traders who attended.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It’s one person’s view of the market,” said one trader who attended the meeting.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Traders are angry ... and they blame ADM,” another trader said.
Distant_Evaluation	Platts said the company is conducting ongoing discussions about evolving its pricing methodology, including feedback from the July conference.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are still evaluating the feedback and continuing bilateral conversations with market participants who were not able to attend,” the company said in a written statement.
Cause_General	ADM can produce roughly 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol annually, about 10 percent of U.S. capacity.
Distant_Evaluation	Despite its massive production, it has often been a buyer on the cash market to supplement its long-term supply deals or to support a market view, dealers said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The company has told investors that a sustained trade war with China could hurt sales.
Cause_General	China, considered the top growth market for U.S. ethanol exports, imposed tariffs of about 70 percent on imports of American biofuel - all but halting shipments there.
Distant_Evaluation	BIG DELIVERIES
Distant_Evaluation	The commodity giant has also been using the futures market to show that it could deliver additional volumes in and around the Chicago hub.
Distant_Evaluation	The company can easily ship to Chicago from its large ethanol plants in Iowa.
Cause_General	On the Chicago Board of Trade, ADM registered all 579 ethanol contracts for delivery as of Tuesday, each contract representing 29,000 gallons – or enough for about one rail tanker car - the most in the history of the contract, according to CME Group data.
Distant_Evaluation	The registrations were a signal to the over 20 other companies also registered to participate in CBOT ethanol deliveries - which include Shell, Green Plains Inc, Vitol and Mercuria - that ADM has an abundant supply of biofuel in storage, to tap and sell against the futures contract.
Distant_Anecdotal	“We don’t really know or understand what they are doing,” said one CEO of a publicly-traded ethanol company.
Distant_Anecdotal	One trader noted that ADM was short 400,000 barrels last week on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Distant_Evaluation	As a major ethanol producer, they are long physical gallons so having a short position in futures as a hedge against physical price declines is not unusual, traders said.

Main_Consequence	The moves over a graft case involving members of Rajoy’s People’s Party prompted heavy selling of Spanish bonds in one of the biggest weekly moves on the euro zone government debt market in years.

Main	TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc (KMI.N) has hired investment bank TD Securities (TD.TO) to facilitate a potential sale of its Canadian business, which could fetch as much as C$2.4 billion ($1.8 billion), people familiar with the situation told Reuters this week.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Should the move succeed, it would mark the exit of the U.S. pipeline giant from Canada, having closed its sale of the Trans Mountain pipeline to the Canadian government for about C$4.5 billion at the end of last month.
Cause_General	After the Reuters report on the hiring of the bank, shares in Kinder Morgan Canada Ltd (KML.TO), which completed its initial public offering just last year, turned positive and jumped 3.7 percent to a three-month high.
Cause_General	They ended up 2.1 percent in a flat market.
Cause_General	Shares in Houston-based Kinder Morgan closed down 1.3 percent.
Cause_General	Spokeswomen for TD and Kinder Morgan declined to comment on the hiring of the investment bank and the valuation.
Cause_General	Sources declined to be identified as the process is private.
Distant_Evaluation	Pipeline companies in Canada have faced opposition from environmental groups and First Nations groups in recent times
Distant_Evaluation	in getting approval for new projects.
Cause_General	Last month, a Canadian court overturned approval of the Trans Mountain expansion, saying that Ottawa failed to adequately consider aboriginal concerns.
Distant_Evaluation	On the flip side though, this makes established pipelines highly prized assets by those operating in the country.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At a conference earlier this month in New York, Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Steven Kean indicated his willingness to sell the rest of the Canadian business, noting that the original purpose of these assets was to support the Trans Mountain project.
Distant_Historical	Kinder Morgan bought Terasen Inc in 2005, a deal in which it acquired the Trans Mountain pipeline and dramatically broadened its footprint in Canada.
Cause_General	Kinder Morgan’s remaining Canadian business includes the Edmonton, Alberta and Vancouver Wharves terminal businesses, as well as the Canadian portion of the Cochin pipeline.
Cause_General	The unit has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about C$200 million, Kean said at the time.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The assets, which could be sold separately or in one swoop, are expected to go for a multiple of 10 to 12 times EBITDA, the sources said, taking the total deal value to C$2.4 billion.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The bidding for the business is expected to come from midstream companies, private equity firms and infrastructure funds, the sources added.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Kinder Morgan would likely keep the assets if it does not get a good price as they generate solid cash flows, the sources added.
Distant_Evaluation	In a note following the Reuters report, RBC analyst Robert Kwan said “we would view a sale process as positive for Kinder Morgan Canada’s share price.”
Distant_Historical	In 2016, Williams Cos Inc (WMB.N), another U.S. pipeline company, sold its Canadian business.
Cause_General	Enbridge Inc (ENB.TO) said in July it would sell its Canadian natural gas gathering and processing business to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP (BIP.N) and its institutional partners for about C$4.31 billion.
Distant_Historical	In February, Canadian oil sands producer MEG Energy (MEG.TO) agreed to sell some pipeline and storage assets in Alberta to Wolf Midstream Inc for C$1.61 billion.
Distant_Evaluation	The occasional activist has stirred up a revolt at an annual general meeting, led a no-confidence vote against management and even taken executives to court.
Distant_Evaluation	Those have been the extreme cases.
Main	But in Europe, shareholder activism -- a term that brings to mind Carl C. Icahn or Kirk Kerkorian, unseating directors and forcing spinoffs with elbows-out tactics -- now seems to be moving toward Main Street and into the hands of ordinary investors.
Main	These no-frills activists are changing the dynamics at the top, their measured but pointed agitation pitting previously passive shareholders, who are used to expressing displeasure by simply selling their shares, against senior management.
Main	In many cases, the shareholders are gaining the upper hand, nudging up share prices and sometimes forcing out an executive or forcing the sale of the company.
Cause_Specific	Most recently, the Children's Investment Fund turned dissatisfaction into deal-making at ABN Amro, leading to rival bids for the bank, the largest in the Netherlands.
Cause_Specific	Then Peter Paul de Vries, the feisty head of the Dutch shareholder association VEB, successfully took ABN Amro's management to court, accusing it of bypassing shareholders when selling one of the bank's most attractive assets.
Distant_Evaluation	''What we have seen so far may only be the beginning,'' said Antonio Borges, chairman of the European Corporate Governance Institute and a vice chairman at Goldman Sachs in London.
Distant_Evaluation	''There are many more opportunities as there are many more underperforming companies.''
Cause_Specific	Prudential, one of Britain's largest insurers, on May 17 faced calls from Hermes, a London-based hedge fund, and other shareholders to break itself up.
Cause_Specific	Deutsche Börse, the operator of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, this month removed from the agenda of its annual shareholder meeting a motion that would have made it easier to issue new shares without asking shareholders -- mainly to appease rebellious Atticus Capital, a New York-based hedge fund.
Cause_Specific	A number of recent cases have shown that shareholder activism can pay: the UK Focus Fund of Hermes, which has taken an activist tack, had annual returns of 4.9 percentage points above the FTSE All-Share Index from 1998 to 2004, according to a 2006 study by the London Business School and the European Corporate Governance Institute.
Distant_Evaluation	Yet, activism does not come cheap.
Cause_Specific	The Children's Investment Fund hired its own press relations specialist to send out almost daily updates to journalists about its ABN Amro campaign.
Distant_Historical	Knight Vinke Asset Management, the Monaco-based activist investor, last year ran advertisements in French and British newspapers to campaign for a breakup of Suez, the French utility.
Distant_Evaluation	Small shareholder associations, whose membership fees do not cover such large campaigns, are happy to jump on the bandwagon, said Jean-Pierre Paelinck, secretary general of Euroshareholders in Brussels.
Distant_Evaluation	The efforts seem to be persuading executives that they need to listen to shareholders or risk their jobs and control over their company.
Distant_Evaluation	Rijkman W. J. Groenink, ABN Amro's chief executive, in an emotional outburst on April 28, complained to a Dutch court that his company had become ''a toy for hedge funds.''
Distant_Historical	Werner G. Seifert, who was ousted as chief executive of Deutsche Börse after an activist investor campaign, last year disclosed his frustration in a memoir called ''Invasion of the Locusts.''
Cause_General	Those who have not yet had contact with activist investors are seeking advice.
Distant_Evaluation	Calls from executives asking what to do in case an activist hedge fund buys into the company are definitely on the rise, said Philip Keevil, a senior partner at Compass Advisers, a merger advisory firm, in London.
Distant_Evaluation	Shareholder activism does not need to be confrontational, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	Managers sometimes welcome active shareholders because it gives them an opportunity to push for changes.
Cause_General	But senior executives are also being pressured to deliver shareholder returns as the investment base of companies shifts from passive institutional investors with longer-term horizons to hedge funds focused on the short term, sometimes holding as little as a 1 percent stake in a company.
Cause_General	Activism was further fueled by a realization among shareholders that selling shares, often at a loss, to protest unsuccessful management did not really change anything.
Cause_General	It simply meant the investment was now weighing on someone else's portfolio as the company continued to underperform.
Distant_Evaluation	''Activist shareholders are giving more confidence to those who felt in the past that they had no say and remind managers of their duties to account for shareholders' interest,'' said David Brooks, head of mergers at the advisory firm Grant Thornton in London.
Cause_General	The recent explosion of private equity wealth and the rising appetite for takeovers are adding to the pressure on management to listen to shareholders.
Cause_General	Analysts say shareholder activism is also focusing on a growing distrust of senior management that can be traced back to corporate scandals like those at Enron and Parmalat.
Distant_Evaluation	There is a general tendency that ''if there is a problem with the company, shareholders will say, 'Let's do something about it ourselves and don't trust the directors to do so,' '' said Roger Lawson, communications director for the UK Shareholders' Association.
Cause_General	Encouraged by the success of activist investors, traditional asset management firms like Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund company in the world, and Templeton, which never made public statements about their investments in the past, also became more vocal and in some instances publicly threw their weight behind an activist hedge fund.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Henderson Global Investors, a 73-year-old British asset management firm, is planning later this year to set up an ''active engagement fund'' to look for undervalued companies, buy a stake in them and work together with the management to improve performance and enhance shareholder value.
Distant_Evaluation	Even though shareholder activism is generally considered to be positive because it makes companies more efficient and increases shareholder returns, some analysts said that the focus on short-term returns can mean important long-term goals were neglected.
Distant_Evaluation	Under pressure to perform, managers may feel forced to come up with short-term fixes for problems that would otherwise require more time to solve, said Mr. Brooks of Grant Thornton.
Distant_Evaluation	But Mr. Borges at the European Corporate Governance Institute said these would remain exceptions because it was in the interest of short-term investors to sell their shares at a profit, and they could do so only if they found new investors who believed in the long-term potential of the revamped company.
Distant_Evaluation	Despite the possible high returns, shareholder activism remains hard work.
Distant_Evaluation	Just how hard is illustrated by the retirement plans of Mr. de Vries, who after 18 years of fighting for shareholders' rights decided to leave the Dutch shareholder group in October.
Distant_Evaluation	Until then, he said, he will fight on and wonder who will be around longer: he or Mr. Groenink of ABN Amro.

Main	STOCKHOLM, Nov. 4 (Xinhua) -- Swedish companies look to the upcoming China International Import Expo (CIIE) to promote their products in the lucrative Chinese market and enhance business ties with China.
Cause_General	According to Economic and Commercial Counselor's Office of the Chinese Embassy in Sweden, 14 Swedish companies including prominent brands such as Hasselblad, Volvo Cars, SAS, etc., registered their participation to the CIIE, to be held in Shanghai on Nov. 5-10.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We believe this Expo would offer a valuable platform which Hasselblad can fully showcase our products and innovative technology to the world,"" said Jon Diele, Vice President of Global Sales and Marketing at Hasselblad, a Swedish camera systems manufacturer."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We expect that more people are able to know Hasselblad, learn our products and experience the image quality of Hasselblad cameras,"" Diele told Xinhua."
Distant_Evaluation	"""China is a growing market for Hasselblad, which has great potential to be developed."
Distant_Evaluation	"Hasselblad's market share in China is increasing year by year."""
Distant_Evaluation	he added.
Distant_Evaluation	"Regarding the expo as ""an important platform to connect China to the world market, which will be beneficial to both China and worldwide business,"" Diele said that it is also ""a strong proof that China is willing to share the market and promote the globalization of trade, as well as increase the global economy."""
Cause_General	China-Sweden cooperation has a long history with two-way trade starting as early as in the 16th century.
Distant_Historical	In 1950, Sweden became the first Western country to establish diplomatic ties with China.
Distant_Evaluation	Over the past 68 years, thanks to the joint efforts of the Chinese and Swedish governments and the business community, the two countries continued to make achievements in economic and trade cooperation, according to the Counselor's Office.
Cause_General	"""Sweden remains China's largest trading partner and provider of capital and technology in the Nordic region,"" Han Xiaodong, China's Economic and Commercial Counselor in Sweden, told Xinhua."
Distant_Historical	"""In 2017, bilateral trade increased to 15 billion U.S. dollars, with Sweden standing on the surplus side for the first time in 25 years, which highlights the increasing popularity of high-quality Swedish products in the Chinese market,"" he said."
Cause_General	"""Two-way investment is on the rise, with Swedish companies investing up to 4.85 billion U.S. dollars in over 1,400 projects in China."

Distant_Historical	Qualcomm, the largest maker of chips in mobile phones, last year launched chips that use technology from Softbank Group Corp’s ARM Holdings to power the workhorse computer servers behind cloud-based services such as social networks.
Cause_General	Qualcomm’s push to enter the data center market puts it in direct competition with Intel Corp, which dominates data centers and now draws half of its revenue from servers and other “data centric” chips.
Cause_Specific	But in May, Bloomberg reported that Qualcomm was exploring whether to sell or shut down the server chip unit.
Main	Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon told Reuters on Monday that the chipmaker is making staff reductions in the unit but intends to keep operating it, albeit with a narrower focus on large internet companies in the United States and China.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We are not looking at strategic options.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	We are not selling.
Distant_Evaluation	We are still focused on it,” Amon told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	San Diego-based Qualcomm declined to say whether it had considered selling the server chip unit at some point in the past.
Distant_Evaluation	The company instead pointed to an April earnings call in which Chief Executive Officer Steve Mollenkopf said Qualcomm was considering cost-cutting options in areas that are not central to Qualcomm’s business, which overwhelmingly comes from selling chips and licensing technology for mobile phones.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Amon told Reuters that the server chip business will be rolled into Qualcom’s Qualcomm CDMA Technologies unit, which designs and sells mobile phone chips, to gain cost efficiencies.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Amon said the restructured server chip unit will focus on large cloud computing players.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He would not name U.S. targets, but said the company is hoping to sell to Chinese internet giants such as Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, Tencent Holdings Ltd and Baidu Inc through a joint venture in China.
Cause_General	Large internet companies tend to write much of their own internal software and can customize it for Qualcomm’s chips.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That means they will not struggle like smaller players to adapt off-the-shelf data center software that is overwhelmingly written to run on Intel’s so-called x86 chips.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s very clear to us that the ARM opportunity is focused on a few players where you don’t have the software x86 barrier to entry,” Amon said.
Main	(Reuters) - Health insurer Cigna Corp’s (CI.N) $52 billion acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co has passed U.S. antitrust scrutiny, the companies said on Monday, allowing them to proceed with a combination they say will lead to lower costs by better coordinating pharmacy and medical benefits.

Distant_Evaluation	Wall Street analysts had expected antitrust approval as the companies have little overlap in their businesses.
Distant_Evaluation	The decision bodes well for the pending U.S. antitrust review of CVS Health Corp’s (CVS.N) proposed $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N.
Cause_General	The new company will marry Cigna’s business of managing health plans for corporations and the government with Express Scripts’ (ESRX.O) role handling pharmacy benefits for those same customers.
Cause_General	Express Scripts also owns specialty pharmacies that distribute pricey drugs.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are pleased that the Department of Justice has cleared our transaction and that we are another step closer to completing our merger,” Cigna Chief Executive David Cordani said in a statement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Justice Department review of CVS’s planned purchase of Aetna may conclude this month, but will take longer because of divestitures needed to resolve competitive concerns, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	CVS spokeswoman Carolyn Castel said the company continues to expect to close its deal late in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter, a forecast it gave investors on Aug. 8 during a conference call.
Distant_Historical	The Justice Department in 2016 successfully blocked a pair of large health insurance mergers it believed would limit competition in the industry.
Distant_Historical	Those were Aetna’s plan to acquire smaller U.S. health insurer Humana Inc (HUM.N) for $37 billion, and a planned $54 billion combination of insurers Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) and Cigna.
Distant_Evaluation	Aetna and Cigna, however, were determined to seek growth through deals while responding to a changing healthcare landscape, eventually targeting mergers with the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs).
Distant_Evaluation	“We believe these two transactions add more pressure on Humana to move further down the path of vertical integration,” William Blair analyst John Kreger said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We suspect other health plans will look to follow suit.”
Distant_Evaluation	FEELING THE PRESSURE
Distant_Evaluation	Antitrust experts have described the current deals as vertical combinations that present fewer issues than the failed insurer mergers.
Distant_Evaluation	That view was bolstered after the Justice Department lost its case to stop AT&T’s (T.N) acquisition of media company Time Warner.
Cause_General	The department is appealing the decision.
Distant_Evaluation	“Everyone is feeling the pressure right now ... to react to disruption in the healthcare industry,” said Brad Haller, a director in West Monroe Partners’ mergers & acquisitions practice.
Cause_General	That disruption includes Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) moves into healthcare.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The world’s largest online retailer purchased online pharmacy PillPack, which Wall Street analysts say can help it undercut traditional prescription drug sales.
Cause_General	Amazon has also aligned itself with JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) to experiment with new business models for employee healthcare - one of Cigna’s target markets.
Cause_General	Cigna’s purchase of Express Scripts comes as PBMs’ role in prescription drug costs has come under scrutiny.
Distant_Evaluation	The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has said it is looking at how so-called industry middlemen and pharmacies such as Express Scripts and CVS impact drug costs for U.S. consumers.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The administration is looking at implementing a rule that could change or eliminate the use of rebates from drugmakers to PBMs that critics say contribute to higher drug prices.
Cause_General	Cigna and Express Scripts said they have already obtained clearances for the deal from departments of insurance in 16 states and are working with regulators in remaining jurisdictions to obtain clearance for the merger.
Distant_Evaluation	“States could still conduct a public hearing ... though it is very unlikely that they do not align with the U.S. Department of Justice’s decision,” Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The companies continue to expect the deal to close by the end of the year, subject to the satisfaction of all closing conditions.
Cause_General	Cigna shares closed up 1.4 percent at $197.84, while Express Scripts shares closed up 3.7 percent at $95.23.
Cause_General	CVS and Aetna shares also rose, closing up 1.5 percent and 1 percent, respectively.

Cause_General	Trump suffered twin setbacks on Tuesday with two former advisers facing possible prison sentences - and one of them saying Trump told him to commit a crime - possibly hurting his Republican Party’s November midterm election prospects and widening a criminal investigation that has overshadowed his presidency.
Distant_Evaluation	This dampened investor appetite for riskier investments across asset classes.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some analysts said renewed U.S. political uncertainty could keep the dollar under pressure, although the immediate currency impact was modest.
Cause_Specific	The dollar index, which fell sharply this week after Trump criticized the U.S. Federal Reserve’s interest-rate increases, was down 0.3 percent to a daily low of 94.93.
Distant_Evaluation	“Political pressure on Trump is increasing ... reducing the likelihood that he will have the political capital to continue driving fiscal stimulus in the U.S. economy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This suggests to many market participants that the era of U.S. outperformance is likely to end,” said Karl Schamotta, director of FX strategy and structured products at Cambridge Global Payments in Toronto.
Cause_General	The dollar also dipped briefly, before recovering, on the release of minutes from the Fed’s last meeting.
Distant_Evaluation	U.S. central bankers discussed raising interest rates soon to counter excessive economic strength but also examined how global trade disputes could batter businesses and households.
Distant_Evaluation	“The FX market did react negatively, with the dollar falling, to cautious comments on trade and emerging markets, as the Fed flagged the downside risks.
Distant_Evaluation	Perhaps the market is extrapolating that it could mean a pause in tightening,” said Shaun Osborne, chief FX strategist at Scotiabank in Toronto.
Distant_Evaluation	But the dollar has been on the defensive recently, said Osborne, and the market is taking any excuse to add to shorts.
Cause_General	Easing fears about a currency crisis in Turkey and the Italian budget, as well as short-covering, sent the euro up for the sixth consecutive day.
Cause_General	The euro gained 0.5 percent to a session high of $1.162.
Distant_Evaluation	That marked a nearly three-cent rebound for the single currency from 14-month lows hit last week on fears of contagion from the Turkish currency crisis and renewed worries about Italian political turbulence.
Distant_Evaluation	The U.S.-China trade talks were set to begin later on Wednesday in Washington.
Distant_Evaluation	Expectations were generally low given they do not involve high-level officials.
Cause_General	The dollar strengthened mostly against the Japanese yen to 110.53 yen.
Cause_Specific	It had weakened to 109.76 overnight, its lowest since late June.

Distant_Evaluation	Political developments in the United States have had limited effects, at least so far.
Cause_General	U.S. President Donald Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations on Tuesday and former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, was found guilty on charges of tax and bank fraud.
Distant_Evaluation	“Stock markets are mixed as trade talks still dominate the headlines,” David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said in a note.
Main	While a rise in the oil price boosted oil stocks .SXEP and miners .SXPP also powered ahead, autos .SXAP were notable underperformers.
Distant_Evaluation	The sector dropped more than 3 percent and was on track for its biggest daily fall since the Brexit vote in June 2016 after automotive supplier Continental AG (CONG.DE) dropped more than 14 percent on the back of a profit warning.
Cause_General	Continental cut its 2018 sales and margin guidance, citing lower revenues, higher costs for developing hybrid and electric car technologies, and unspecified warranty claims.
Distant_Evaluation	“While most profit warnings are by definition a surprise, this one is all the more concerning as most of these headwinds were flagged and should have been evident when the company reported H2 results on 2 August; higher warranty costs being an exception,” analysts at Jefferies said in a note.
Main	Elsewhere, shares in Belgian biopharma Argenx (ARGX.BR) rose 4.7 percent after Abbvie (ABBV.N) exercised an option to develop and commercialize a drug.
Main	Among smaller companies, Adyen (ADYEN.AS), the Dutch company which processes payments for Netflix and Facebook, reported H1 profit up 75 percent and jumped 4.3 percent.
Main	Though Atlantia (ATL.MI) rose earlier in the session, shares in the Italian infrastructure group declined steadily throughout the day and ended nearly 4 percent lower.
Distant_Evaluation	The group said it had started looking at the impact on its shares and bonds of government plans to strip it of its motorway concessions after the Genoa bridge collapse.
Main	Linde (LING.DE) dipped 0.6 percent after warning that divestments needed to secure approval for its planned tie-up with Praxair had a size that would allow either party to abandon the deal.

Distant_Evaluation	LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Jean Pierre Mustier can’t be faulted for his ambition.
Cause_Specific	In the middle of a demanding turnaround of UniCredit, the Frenchman has once again raised the idea of merging Italy’s biggest bank by assets with his former employer Société Générale, according to the Financial Times.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The much-mooted combination would create a behemoth stretching from France to Russia.
Main	But Italy’s radical new government presents a fresh obstacle.
Distant_Evaluation	There are good reasons why the idea of uniting the two lenders has been kicked around for a decade and a half – and why it has not happened.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The combined bank would derive over two-fifths of its revenue from France, Italy and Germany, and another 16 percent from eastern Europe, according to analysts at KBW.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Its bigger investment banking unit would be better able to compete with American rivals.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Jefferies analysts reckon the two could cut costs by around 1.6 billion euros a year before tax, equal to 18 percent of their combined 2017 pre-tax profit.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The merger would also fulfil the European Central Bank’s aspirations for bigger, more diversified European banks.
Cause_General	Though past talks have foundered on clashing executive egos, there is some overlap between the two lenders’ respective management teams.
Distant_Historical	Mustier once ran SocGen’s investment banking arm.
Cause_General	The 30 billion euro French group’s Chairman, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, is a respected Italian economist and former ECB board member.
Cause_General	Yet the usual barriers to cross-border European consolidation still apply.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The larger bank would face extra capital requirements and struggle to mesh disparate computer systems.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A merger would also do little to lower national barriers that require UniCredit’s German unit to maintain an unusually high capital buffer, more than a decade after the Italian group took control.
Main	The new stumbling block, however, is Italy’s politics.
Cause_General	The 32 billion UniCredit holds 51 billion euros of Italian government bonds, making it vulnerable to doubts about the new government’s commitment to the single currency.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The administration’s policies would also make Italy’s labour market less flexible, and could make it harder for lenders to seize collateral backing bad loans.
Cause_General	Despite a recent bounce, UniCredit shares are down 17 percent over the past two weeks.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Shifting UniCredit’s head office to Paris might help to insulate the bank’s non-Italian operations from political turmoil in Rome.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But unless Italy’s euro zone tantrums diminish, the SocGen merger dream looks likely to remain just that.

Main	BEIJING, Nov. 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government on Wednesday decided to carry out an assessment of its business environment, according to a statement released after a State Council executive meeting presided over by Premier Li Keqiang.
Main	The assessment will focus on areas closely related to market participants, including starting a business, getting a construction permit, obtaining a loan, paying taxes, going through bankruptcy procedures and protecting intellectual property rights.
Main	The country will push for rolling out more hard measures for improving the business environment to maintain China's attraction for domestic and foreign investment, the statement said.
Main	China will expand the implementation of practices that prove to be effective in facilitating the operations of enterprises from a number of local areas through to the whole country, according to the statement.
Main	It was also decided at the meeting that measures will be taken to increase the supply and improve the quality of elderly care services.
Main	LONDON (Reuters) - Unilever (ULVR.L) (UNc.AS) executives scrapped plans to move the company headquarters to the Netherlands on Friday in the face of a shareholder revolt, keeping one of Britain’s most valuable businesses in London ahead of Brexit.
Distant_Evaluation	The climbdown came just three weeks before planned votes on the proposal and is a victory for shareholders who opposed a change which would have removed the maker of Marmite, Dove soap and Ben & Jerry's ice cream from the benchmark FTSE 100 index .FTSE.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are pleased they have abandoned the plan to ‘go Dutch’,” said GAM portfolio manager Ali Miremadi, who intended to vote against the move.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Now the company can put its focus into the core job – driving long-term shareholder value.”
Main	Unilever’s board, led by Chairman Marijn Dekkers and fellow Dutchman Paul Polman, the chief executive, agreed to scrap the plan during a call early on Friday after it became clear that it could fall short of the approval needed, a source familiar with the matter said.
Distant_Evaluation	Unilever had decided to collapse its Anglo-Dutch structure following a review sparked by last year’s failed $143 billion takeover approach by Kraft-Heinz (KHC.O).
Distant_Evaluation	The stated aim was to make it more efficient and agile in a consumer market rocked by e-commerce, social media and upstart rivals.
Cause_Specific	But at least 10 shareholders, which collectively own around 12 percent of Unilever PLC, had publicly opposed the move.
Distant_Evaluation	They were worried about the effective forced selling of their shares with no premium, uncertainty around the future tax treatment of Dutch dividends and a perception that the move was partly aimed at securing greater takeover protection under Dutch law.
Distant_Evaluation	Unilever’s U-turn comes at a sensitive time for the British government, which is battling to protect jobs and investment as Prime Minister Theresa May fights for her proposed divorce plan from the European Union.
Distant_Evaluation	“The UK is one of the best places in the world to grow a business, and our modern Industrial Strategy commits us to being an open and competitive economy and a great place to locate global headquarters,” Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
Cause_General	Even with a single corporate entity domiciled in the Netherlands, Unilever was keeping two of its three business units in Britain, allowing it to maintain its UK staff of 7,300.
Main_Consequence	In the Netherlands, the decision has triggered political fallout for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte over his unpopular proposal to scrap a withholding tax on dividends that was seen as helping to woo Unilever.

Distant_Evaluation	He said on Friday the government was reconsidering the plan.
Distant_Evaluation	Deputy Finance Minister Menno Snel said the Dutch cabinet was meeting to discuss the consequences.
Distant_Evaluation	“We would have liked to have seen this turn out differently,” he told reporters.
Distant_Evaluation	HARD SELL
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Unilever’s exit from the FTSE would have forced funds mandated to track the index to sell their shares.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That may have pressured the price for the remaining shareholders, some of whom worried that shares in the new Unilever would be less liquid.
Distant_Evaluation	The plan’s highest hurdle was that it needed backing of a majority of UK shareholders, holding at least 75 percent of the shares.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Those two conditions meant that small shareholders, often overlooked, could have swung the vote.
Cause_General	As such, a number of independent investors holding their shares in nominee accounts had contacted their administrators in recent days to make adjustments needed to vote themselves, according to two trading platforms.
Cause_General	The Investor Forum, which works to escalate investor
Cause_General	concerns to companies, said it worked with over 20 institutions on this issue.
Distant_Evaluation	“This demonstrates the value of asset managers actively engaging with their investee companies,” said Rupert Krefting, head of corporate governance and stewardship, at M&G Investments, which opposed the proposal.
Cause_General	Unilever took the unusual step of putting a full-page advert in the British press to try to sell the idea to skeptical investors, and executives gave a round of interviews last week to make their point.

Cause_Specific	But on Friday Unilever recognized that the proposal had not received support from a significant group of shareholders.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders,” Dekkers said, adding Unilever will proceed with the plan to cancel its Dutch preference shares.
Cause_Specific	Earlier this week, influential proxy advisory firm PIRC recommended shareholders vote against the move.
Cause_Specific	Another service, IVIS - the corporate governance research service of the Investment Association - issued a “red top” recommendation on the move on Friday, its strongest level of concern.
Distant_Evaluation	Sources said Unilever saw the writing on the wall.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s always common for a vote to be pulled when it’s going to lose,” said Tim Bush, head of governance and financial analysis at PIRC.
Distant_Evaluation	WHAT NEXT
Distant_Historical	Unilever’s Anglo-Dutch structure dates back to 1929 when British soap maker Lever Brothers combined with Dutch margarine company Margarine Unie.
Distant_Historical	Unilever sold its margarine and spreads business earlier this year to KKR (KKR.N).
Distant_Evaluation	The company’s board on Friday said it still believes that simplifying its dual-headed structure is the best choice for the long term.
Distant_Evaluation	For now, investors are likely to focus on the company’s operational performance.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It will report third-quarter results on 18 October.
Cause_General	Unilever’s London-listed shares were down 0.6 percent at 1232 GMT, while its Dutch shares were roughly flat.
Distant_Evaluation	The biggest performance drivers currently are U.S. interest rates and difficulties in emerging markets, particularly related to currencies, said Liberum analyst Robert Waldschmidt.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“This change should not really affect the group’s near-term operation, although it may lead to a faster pace for CEO succession planning,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	CEO Polman will mark his 10th anniversary as CEO in January, and speculation about succession has swirled for the last year.
Cause_General	Unilever was advised by its corporate brokers, UBS and Deutsche Bank, and its legal adviser, Linklaters.
Main	RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will auction real estate owned by indebted billionaire Maan al-Sanea and his company starting next month to help repay billions of riyals due to creditors, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Cause_General	Sanea, ranked by Forbes in 2007 as one of the world’s 100 richest people, was detained last year for unpaid debts dating back to 2009 when his company, Saad Group, defaulted.
Cause_General	His case is separate from the scores of Saudi businessmen and prominent figures who were held on corruption charges last year at Riyadh’s Ritz Carlton hotel, although it touches on similar investor concerns about corporate governance.
Cause_Specific	In what was Saudi Arabia’s longest-running debt dispute, creditors have spent the past nine years pursuing Saad Group, which is based in the Eastern Province, for debt repayment.
Main	Etqaan Alliance, the consortium appointed late last year by a three-judge tribunal to resolve Saad’s debt dispute, will sell the assets over five months at auctions in the Eastern Province, Riyadh and Jeddah, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
Main	The first auction - of undeveloped and commercial land plots, a farm, and income-generating residential buildings in Eastern Province’s Khobar and Dammam - will take place in late October, the sources added.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	One source estimated sale proceeds at one to two billion riyals ($267-$533 million).
Distant_Evaluation	A creditor source said the auction had been delayed because of weakness in the local property market.
Distant_Historical	In March, Etqaan launched the first phase of the auction with around 900 vehicles owned by Saad Group, including trucks, buses, diggers, forklift trucks and golf carts.
Distant_Historical	That auction raised around 125 million riyals, which went to repay some creditors, including unpaid workers.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Proceeds from upcoming auctions will go to 34 creditors, mostly banks, the sources said.
Cause_General	It is unclear whether Sanea, who remains in detention, will be released after his assets are sold.
Distant_Historical	Saad Group, with interests spanning banking to healthcare, defaulted together with Ahmad Hamad al-Gosaibi and Brothers (AHAB) in 2009, leaving banks with unpaid debt of about $22 billion in what was Saudi Arabia’s biggest financial meltdown.
Cause_General	Earlier this year, Reemas, a financial consultancy advising al-Sanea, reached out to some creditors to try to agree to a settlement that could involve swapping creditor debts for real estate assets, but the terms are still under negotiation.
Cause_Specific	Local, regional and international banks eligible for a settlement have claims totaling 16 billion riyals, with international banks such as BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Citi (C.N), and regional lenders such as Mashreq, having claims of over 1 billion riyals each, sources told Reuters previously.
Distant_Evaluation	Some observers estimate Saad’s total debt to be between 40 billion and 60 billion riyals.

Cause_General	Economic data also failed to reassure investors with euro zone factory growth slowing to an 18-month low in June amid widespread concerns about new trade barriers.
Main	The pan-European STOXX 600 ended the session down 0.8 percent with losses across the continent and sectors.
Distant_Evaluation	“As has become the pattern of late, the markets sank on Monday morning following the latest weekend tariff talk from (U.S. President) Donald Trump, presumably to leave investors scrabbling about for any signs of trade war-avoidance across the rest of the week,” commented Spreadex analyst Connor Campbell.
Cause_General	The European Union has warned the United States that imposing import tariffs on cars and car parts would harm its own automotive industry and likely lead to counter-measures.
Main	Germany's trade-sensitive DAX .GDAXI was down 0.6 percent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Merkel is to make a last-ditch effort to end a migration row with her conservative CSU allies by holding talks with her interior minister, whose offer to resign cast doubt over whether her fragile government can survive.
Distant_Evaluation	“The risk that the CSU may walk out of the government in Berlin, turning Merkel into the leader of a minority government, remains serious,” said Holger Schmieding from Berenberg.
Cause_General	In Frankfurt, shares in consumer electronics retailer Ceconomy (CECG.DE) were up 8.6 percent after news that telecoms company Freenet (FNTGn.DE), down 2.7 percent, would acquire a 9 percent stake.

Main	French supermarket retailer Carrefour (CARR.PA) and British peer Tesco (TSCO.L) lost 0.9 percent and 0.2 percent respectively after they announced plans to form a global long-term purchasing alliance, as they seek to cut costs.
Distant_Evaluation	“An entente cordiale between the two giants of British and French retailing is yet another sign that squeezing the cost base is the biggest priority for supermarkets as they seek to contain the discounters and protect margins”, said Neil Wilson chief market analyst at Markets.com.

Main	British gambling technology company Playtech (PTEC.L) posted the worst performance, losing over 26 percent after it disappointed investors with a trading update.
Cause_General	Among rare winners, British software company Micro Focus International (MCRO.L) was up 1.5 percent after it said it had agreed to sell its Linux operating system SUSE business to a private equity fund advised by Sweden’s EQT Partners for $2.535 billion.
Main	Milan's FTSE MIB .FTMIB was down 0.9 percent with Italian pharmaceutical group Recordati (RECI.MI) falling 12.5 percent after a consortium of investment funds controlled by CVC Capital Partners has agreed to buy a stake at a discount.
Main	(Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) ousted Chief Executive Officer John Flannery in a surprise move on Monday, replacing him with outsider and board member Larry Culp, and said it would take a roughly $23 billion charge to write off goodwill in its power division, primarily from a large 2015 acquisition.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The struggling energy, health and transportation conglomerate also said it would fall short of its forecast for free cash flow and earnings per share for 2018 due to weakness in its power business, something analysts had expected.
Cause_General	GE shares jumped 7 percent to close at $12.09 as investors bet that Culp could re-energize the GE brand and more quickly transform its portfolio.
Cause_General	The stock was the top percentage gainer on the S&P 500 .SPX.
Cause_General	The shares had more than halved since Flannery, a three-decade GE veteran, became CEO in August 2017 to replace Jeff Immelt, who had led GE since 2001.
Cause_General	With a market capitalization below $100 billion as of Friday, GE was worth less than a fifth of its peak value a generation ago.
Distant_Historical	GE Power’s falling profits last year forced GE to slash its overall profit outlook and cut its dividend for only the second time since the Great Depression.
Main	GE’s board, meeting in the last few days, unanimously picked Culp as its new CEO.
Distant_Historical	Culp, 55, who was named to GE’s board in February, was CEO of industrial equipment supplier Danaher Corp (DHR.N) from 2000 to 2014, helping grow the company into a broader conglomerate through a series of acquisitions, while also growing earnings.
Cause_General	Related Coverage GE's long share price decline claims another casualty
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some analysts said that GE Power likely missed financial targets for the third quarter, contributing to Flannery’s ouster.
Cause_General	GE, scheduled to report results on Oct. 25, declined to comment.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The broad strategies are likely to be similar because the plan laid out by Flannery was made in conjunction with heavy involvement from the board, which included Culp, said Gabelli & Co analyst Justin Bergner.
Distant_Evaluation	SHADOW OF ITS FORMER SELF
Distant_Evaluation	GE’s board was unhappy with the pace of the company’s turnaround under Flannery, and when the size of the writedown in the power plant division, which makes electric generating equipment, became apparent, the board was persuaded to seek a new CEO, according to a person familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential deliberations.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, GE will not be changing its announced breakup plan, which calls for spinning off healthcare and shedding its stake in oil services company Baker Hughes (BHGE.N), the source added.
Error	FILE PHOTO: General Electric CEO John Flannery is seen at the company’s office in New York City, U.S., June 26, 2018.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Culp indicated that he will tackle the company’s problems aggressively.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We will move with urgency.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	... We have a lot of work ahead of us to unlock the value of GE,” he said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	The troubles in the power plant unit have been intensifying, as Reuters reported in July, with the news that one of its most valuable clients, Saudi Arabia, was lining up competitors to bid against GE for lucrative power plant work.
Distant_Historical	GE doubled down on fossil fuels in 2015 under Immelt with the $10.3 billion purchase of French group Alstom SA’s (ALSO.PA) power business.
Distant_Historical	The deal expanded GE’s exposure to gas, coal and nuclear power.
Distant_Historical	It added employees, dozens of factories and service centers at a time when GE was trying to cut costs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The board is signaling to the market that we are not going to give anyone free reign like we did with Jeff Immelt,” said Morningstar analyst Joshua Aguilar.
Distant_Evaluation	The power division’s outlook appeared to worsen last month when GE said several power plants equipped with its newest turbines had to be shut down because of a part failure.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Changing CEOs “won’t fix short-term problems at power, but Larry, as an outsider, will be able to make the difficult decisions on cost,” said Scott Davis, an analyst at Melius Research in New York.
Distant_Evaluation	“GE is bloated and its culture is destroyed.”

Distant_Evaluation	Davis said the stock price has probably already adjusted to expectations of no contribution from power.
Cause_General	A slimmed down General Electric - a 126-year-old conglomerate that was once the most valuable U.S. corporation and a global symbol of American business power — will focus on jet engines, power plants and renewable energy.
Distant_Historical	In June, GE lost its spot in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI after over a century.
Distant_Evaluation	“Investors grew impatient with the lack of improvement and with the sheer scale of the problems uncovered.
Distant_Evaluation	However, these problems were not created under [Flannery’s] tenure,” CFRA analyst Jim Corridore said in a note.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The market seems to be welcoming a change in leadership but the new CEO will be facing many of the same problems.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	GE said the power division’s goodwill balance is about $23 billion and the impairment charge would eliminate most of it.
Distant_Evaluation	The non-cash charge primarily relates to GE’s acquisition of power assets from Alstom in 2015, GE said.
Cause_General	GE’s long stock slide means the once-largest U.S. industrial company is now only sixth in terms of market capitalization, behind Boeing Co (BA.N), 3M Co (MMM.N), Honeywell International Inc (HON.N), United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) and others.

Main	(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is ditching plans to open a desk for trading cryptocurrencies as the regulatory framework for crypto remains unclear, Business Insider reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

Cause_Specific	In recent weeks, Goldman executives have concluded that many steps still need to be taken, most of them outside the bank’s control, before a regulated bank would be allowed to trade cryptocurrencies, the financial news website reported.
Distant_Evaluation	“At this point, we have not reached a conclusion on the scope of our digital asset offering,” Goldman Sachs spokesperson Michael DuVally told Reuters.
Cause_General	Major cryptocurrencies plunged on the news.
Cause_General	Bitcoin BTC=BTSP fell nearly 5 percent to touch five-day low at $6,985 on the Luxembourg-based Bitstamp exchange.
Cause_General	Ethereum slid 9 percent, Litecoin 7.1 percent and Ripple 7.7 percent.
Distant_Historical	In October, Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein had tweeted, “Still thinking about Bitcoin.
Distant_Historical	No conclusion - not endorsing/rejecting.
Distant_Historical	Know that folks also were skeptical when paper money displaced gold.”
Distant_Evaluation	Blankfein’s tweet was in sharp contrast to comments made by JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) CEO Jamie Dimon, who called bitcoin a “fraud.” It is worse than tulips bulbs,” Dimon had said, referring to a famous market bubble from the 1600s.
Distant_Evaluation	Goldman’s rival Morgan Stanley (MS.N) had spoken in favor of the currency, with CEO James Gorman calling it “more than just a fad.”
Cause_General	The virtual currency can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.
Cause_General	A fund holding the currency could attract more investors and push its price higher.
Distant_Historical	Bitcoin had rocketed to a record high of $16,000 in December.
Distant_Historical	Several small U.S. firms reshaped their business models to capitalize on the craze for blockchain technology, which supports cryptocurrency.
Distant_Historical	Beverage maker Long Island Iced Tea Corp’s LTEA.O shares jumped nearly 300 percent in late December after the company said it would rebrand itself Long Blockchain Corp.
Cause_General	However, regulators across the world have been intensifying their scrutiny of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrency exchanges.
Distant_Historical	Last year, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warned that some of the coins issued in ICOs could be considered securities, implying that trading them would have to comply with federal securities laws.

Distant_Evaluation	When Institutional Investor's Alpha magazine released its annual list of the highest paid hedge fund managers last month, it allowed the rest of us to play an entertaining little parlor game: what could you buy if you made as much money as those guys?
Cause_Specific	James Simons, a 69-year-old mathematician who was at the top of the list, earned $1.7 billion, which equaled the amount of money that the federal government spent last year running its vast network of national parks.
Cause_Specific	Down at No.
Cause_Specific	3 on the list, Edward S. Lampert of Greenwich, Conn., the investor who owns a large chunk of Sears, made $1.3 billion, which, if you forget about taxes, would have allowed him to buy the entire economic output of Sierra Leone.
Cause_General	We're talking about real money here.
Main	Today, Alpha magazine will release another big list, and this one offers a chance to answer another, arguably more important, question: Are these billionaire hedge fund managers really worth it?
Cause_Specific	The reason hedge funds are a license to print money is their fee structure.
Cause_Specific	A typical fund charges a 2 percent management fee, which means that it keeps 2 cents of every dollar that it manages, regardless of performance.
Cause_General	Mutual funds, on average, charge about 1 percent.
Cause_Specific	On top of the management fee, hedge funds also take a big cut -- usually at least 20 percent -- of any profits that exceed a predetermined benchmark.
Distant_Evaluation	So in a good year, a fund's managers bring in stunning amounts of money, and in a bad year, they still do very well.
Cause_General	Some quick math shows why: 2 percent of a $5 billion portfolio, which was roughly the cutoff for making Alpha's list of the 100 largest funds, equals $100 million.
Cause_General	A fund's managers get to take that fee every single year.
Distant_Evaluation	Last year was actually a pretty tough year for the industry.
Distant_Evaluation	Because hedge funds tend to make a lot of countercyclical bets -- thus the name -- they can often turn a profit even when the stock market falls.
Distant_Evaluation	When it's rising broadly, though, many struggle to keep up.
Distant_Historical	Last year, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index jumped 14 percent, while the average hedge fund returned less than 13 percent, after investment fees, according to Hedge Fund Research in Chicago.
Cause_General	But the men -- and they are all men -- who appear on Alpha's list of top earners don't manage average hedge funds.
Cause_Specific	They manage the biggest funds in the world, the ones that are winning the Darwinian competition for capital, and many of them aren't having any trouble beating the market.
Distant_Historical	One of the funds at Mr. Simons's firm, Renaissance Technologies, delivered a net return of 21 percent last year.
Distant_Historical	The other returned 44 percent after fees.
Cause_Specific	And Mr. Simons, who relies on a fantastically complex set of algorithms, doesn't charge ''2 and 20'' -- as the typical industry fees are called.
Cause_Specific	He charges ''5 and 44'' -- a 5 percent management fee and 44 percent of profits -- yet he has still been doing very well by his investors for almost two decades.
Distant_Evaluation	I realize that a lot of people find 9- and 10-figure incomes to be inherently excessive.
Distant_Evaluation	Or even immoral.
Distant_Evaluation	From a strictly economic point of view, however, they are also perfectly rational.
Distant_Evaluation	You cannot find anyone else who is providing the same returns as the best hedge fund managers at a lower price.
Distant_Evaluation	If you don't like it, you don't have to give them your money.
Distant_Evaluation	(Even if you do like it, they probably won't take your money.
Cause_General	In exchange for being lightly regulated, hedge funds are open only to wealthy investors and big institutions.)
Distant_Evaluation	Thanks to their incredible performance, the biggest funds have grown far bigger in recent years.
Distant_Historical	The 100 largest firms in the world managed $1 trillion at the end of last year, or 69 percent of all the assets in hedge funds, according to Alpha.
Distant_Historical	At the end of 2003, the top 100 had less than $500 billion, or only 54 percent of total hedge fund investments.
Distant_Anecdotal	''The best performance is coming from the largest funds,'' said Christy Wood, who oversees equities investments for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, which, like a lot of pension funds, is moving more money into hedge funds.
Distant_Evaluation	But there is an irony to this influx of money.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It all but guarantees that hedge fund pay over the next few years won't be as closely tied to performance as it has been.
Distant_Evaluation	The hundreds of millions of dollars that have flowed into hedge funds have made it all the harder for fund managers to find truly undervalued investments.
Distant_Evaluation	The world is awash in capital.
Cause_General	All that capital, of course, also translates into ever-greater management fees, regardless of a fund's performance.
Distant_Historical	The flagship hedge fund at Goldman Sachs lost 6 percent last year, but it still brought in a nice stream of fees.
Distant_Historical	Bridgewater Associates, which is based in Greenwich, has earned a net return of less than 4 percent in each of the last two years.
Distant_Historical	Yet its founder, Raymond T. Dalio, made $350 million in 2006.
Distant_Anecdotal	''When we have a bad year, we're essentially flat,'' Parag Shah, a Bridgewater executive, told me.
Distant_Anecdotal	''And when we have a good year, we have a great year.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Goldman and Bridgewater may well bounce back, but the combination of extraordinary pay and ordinary performance is going to occur more and more in the coming years.
Cause_General	Outside of the highfliers on the Alpha list, it's already the norm.
Cause_General	Since 2000, the average hedge fund hasn't done any better, after fees, than the market as a whole, according to research by David A. Hsieh, a finance professor at Duke.
Distant_Evaluation	Still, even mediocre managers, after a lucky year or two, are able to attract gobs of capital and charge ''2 and 20.''
Distant_Evaluation	So are today's hedge fund managers really worth it?
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Sure, but only if they deliver the sort of performance that Mr. Simons has, and very few will in the years ahead.
Distant_Evaluation	More to the point, it's extremely difficult to know who the stars will be.
Distant_Evaluation	In all sorts of walks of life, people tend to think that the past is a better predictor of the future than it really is.
Distant_Evaluation	That's why journeyman baseball players -- a Yankees pitcher named Carl Pavano comes to mind -- are able to sign huge contracts based on a single good season.
Distant_Evaluation	It's also why so many investors chase returns.
Distant_Evaluation	The genius of the world's hedge fund managers isn't only in how they invest their money.
Distant_Evaluation	It also lies in having set up an industry that takes advantage of a timeless human trait.

Main	SEOUL, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's central bank said Friday that it has picked 11 banks, including five foreign banks, as liquidity provider in the direct won-yuan trading market for next year.
Distant_Historical	The direct transaction market between the South Korean won and the Chinese yuan was launched here in 2014 to boost payments and settlements in trade using both currencies and reduce the exchange rate-related risks.
Main	The six domestic banks, selected to take the lead in providing bid and offer prices in the won-yuan market, included Kookmin Bank, Industrial Bank of Korea, Shinhan Bank, Woori Bank, KEB Hana Bank and Korea Development Bank, according to the Bank of Korea (BOK).
Main	The five local branches of foreign banks were Bank of Communications, China Construction Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, and HSBC.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The BOK said it would continue to support the liquidity providers and make efforts to facilitate the settlement using the South Korean won and the Chinese yuan.
Cause_General	As of December, the daily average trading volume was 1.82 U.S. dollars in the won-yuan trading market in Seoul.
Main	(Reuters) - Great-West Lifeco Inc (GWO.TO), Canada’s second-biggest insurance company, is exploring the sale of a collection of insurance contracts that could fetch as much as $2 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Distant_Evaluation	The deal would represent one of the biggest divestments of such insurance books in recent times.
Cause_General	Insurance companies have been offloading such blocks, consisting of policies in areas where no new business is being underwritten, to free up cash to invest in more profitable parts of their operations.
Cause_General	The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential.
Distant_Evaluation	A spokesperson for Great-West said “as a matter of policy, we don’t comment on speculation or rumors”.
Main	Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is arranging the sale process, the sources said.
Cause_General	A spokesperson for Goldman declined to comment.
Main	The portfolio of run-off insurance business being marketed by Great-West includes structured settlements, pay-out annuities, and corporate or bank-owned life insurance (COLI/BOLI), the sources said.
Main	Some group benefits policies are also part of the sale, one of them said.
Cause_Specific	Management at the Winnipeg-based insurer held meetings in mid-August with prospective bidders which had made it through an initial round of bidding, according to the one source.
Cause_General	Among the parties to have shown interest in the policies include other insurance firms and financial companies, a second source said.
Distant_Evaluation	Private equity firms and specialist investment firms such as Athene Holding (ATH.N) and Wilton Re have been significant buyers of run-off insurance blocks, believing they can juice the profits from administering such policies by cutting costs.
Cause_General	Among the largest such transactions in recent times are the $2.05 billion sale of Hartford Financial Services Group’s (HIG.N) life insurance and annuity run-off businesses to a group of investors, and Wilton Re’s $14 billion deal involving Aegon NV’s’ (AEGN.AS) pay-out annuity and COLI/BOLI businesses in the United States.
Cause_General	As well as Canada, Great-West Lifeco and its subsidiaries have operations in the United States and Europe and have more than $1.4 trillion of consolidated assets under administration as of June 30, according to public filings from majority shareholder Power Financial Corp (PWF.TO).

Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods increased more than expected in July and growth in shipments held firm, signaling that business investment started the third quarter on a strong note.
Cause_Specific	The Commerce Department said on Friday orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, rose 1.4 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.9 percent increase in June.
Distant_Evaluation	“That provides further reason to think that overall GDP has continued to expand at a healthy ... pace,” said Andrew Hunter, an economist at Capital Economics.
Cause_General	Business spending on equipment is being supported by the Trump administration’s $1.5 trillion income tax cut package, which came into effect in January.
Distant_Evaluation	But there are worries that trade tensions between the United States and its major trade partners, including China, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, could offset the fiscal stimulus.
Cause_Specific	Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the so-called core capital goods orders rising 0.4 percent in July after a previously reported 0.2 percent gain in June.
Cause_General	Core capital goods orders increased 7.2 percent on a year-on-year basis.
Cause_Specific	Shipments of core capital goods rose 0.9 percent last month after an upwardly revised 0.9 percent gain in June.
Cause_General	Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government’s gross domestic product measurement, so the higher estimate for shipments in June could contribute to an upward revision of economic growth in the second quarter.
Cause_General	Yields on U.S. government debt rose modestly after the data, with investors awaiting a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
Cause_General	U.S. stocks were trading higher while the dollar .DXY was down against a basket of currencies.
Cause_General	Business investment drove about a quarter of economic growth in the second quarter.
Cause_General	The economy grew at its fastest pace in the April-June period as consumers boosted spending and farmers rushed shipments of soybeans to China before retaliatory trade tariffs took effect in early July.
Cause_General	The United States has slapped duties on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods so far, eliciting the retaliation from Beijing.
Cause_General	Overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, fell 1.7 percent in July as volatile demand for civilian aircraft fell.

Main	BEIJING, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- China will reduce taxes and fees on a larger scale next year, according to the country's finance minister.
Main	Inclusive and structural tax cuts will be implemented in 2019, with priority on easing the burden on manufacturing as well as for small and micro-sized businesses, Minister of Finance Liu Kun told a national fiscal work conference held Thursday and Friday.
Main	Technology startups will also be offered tax cuts and exemptions, the minister said.
Main	"He pledged ""more significant"" fee reductions with moves to better regulate local fee charging."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The government will increase the efficiency of fiscal fund allocation and usage, optimize the structure of spending, and fully implement budget performance management next year, according to Liu.
Distant_Evaluation	"He urged governments at all levels to ""tighten their belts"" by slashing general expenditure, strictly controlling spending on official overseas visits, government-procured vehicles and official receptions, and scrapping inefficient expenses."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""In addition, management of local government debt will be strengthened next year, with a relatively large increase in special bond issuance by local governments,"" Liu said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	China will strengthen counter-cyclical adjustments in its macro policy in 2019, with bolder and more effective measures to be taken to implement the proactive fiscal policy, according to the annual Central Economic Work Conference held last week.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	LONDON (Reuters) - Schroders (SDR.L) could soon help manage the money of people with significantly less in their bank accounts than the super-rich it has targeted so far, if talks with Lloyds (LLOY.L) about a wealth management tie-up succeed.
Main	Schroders, Britain’s second largest listed fund management group by assets under management and Lloyds Banking Group, Britain’s biggest retail lender, confirmed on Sunday they are in talks, but gave no further details.
Cause_General	However, sources familiar with the discussions confirmed details of a Sky News report which said Lloyds would roll 13.8 billion pounds ($18 billion) of client money into a joint venture with Schroders, which would contribute its technology, operational platform and investment skills.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This would allow Schroders to access thousands of so-called mass affluent, those with hundreds of thousands of pounds, rather than millions or billions, in investable capital.
Distant_Evaluation	It would be the latest step in a long-standing plan by Schroders to diversify its revenues and follow other recent acquisitions in the sector as the industry consolidates.
Distant_Historical	Rathbone (RAT.L) bought Scotland’s Speirs & Jeffrey for 104 million pounds earlier this year, but as one of the only large British asset managers with a significant wealth management arm, analysts do not expect the Schroders talks to trigger copy-cat deals.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“A relationship with Lloyds could be an important source of new assets in Schroders’ home market.
Distant_Evaluation	This points to management’s flexibility in the way it goes to market and to its savvy around building distribution relationships,” Bernstein analyst Edward Houghton said in a note to investors.
Cause_General	Lloyds (LLOY.L), which is looking for ways to diversify its business mix from banking, where further expansion is limited, has targeted insurance and wealth and made them a key pillar of its most recent three-year strategy outlined in February.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The bank, which would own 50.1 percent of the joint venture, stood to gain from Schroders’ investment skills and greater diversification, analysts said.

Cause_General	Lloyds is also discussing taking a minority stake in Schroders’ Cazenove Capital wealth management arm, which manages the money of its existing wealthy clients.
Cause_General	MANDATE
Cause_General	The third pillar of the deal would see Schroders secure a high-profile new business mandate to manage 109 billion pounds of Lloyd’s insurance assets.
Cause_General	This has been up for grabs since February, when Lloyds ended a management deal with newly-merged Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA.L) which it said had become a “material competitor”.
Cause_General	The annual revenue associated with the Lloyds asset management contracts represented around 130 million pounds.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Since then, several of the world’s biggest asset managers have competed for the mandate, which analysts at UBS said could add between 5 and 7 percent to Schroders earnings.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“It would give Schroders an important scale advantage when attempting to win further mandates from insurers, given the scale-driven nature of the business,” they said, flagging a price target of 3,600 pence and ‘buy’ rating.
Cause_General	Schroders, whose shares were 0.2 percent lower at 1216 GMT, saw its existing wealth management business post a solid first half, with net income up 8 percent to 144 million pounds and pre-tax profit of 38 million pounds.
Cause_General	The FTSE 100 .FTSE index was down 0.7 percent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	For Lloyds, whose shares were down 0.9 percent, the plans involve leveraging its position to be able to offer insurance and wealth services under the same roof via its insurance subsidiary Scottish Widows.
Distant_Evaluation	“Something like this I think will be transformative from the perspective of the growth of that business,” John Cronin, financials analyst at Goodbody, told Reuters.

Main	SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) are entering a partnership in which the iPhone maker will help Salesforce build the iPhone maker’s features such as its Siri voice assistant deeper into Salesforce’s own mobile apps, which are widely used in the sales and marketing industries.
Main	In exchange, Salesforce will make software tools so that the big businesses that use its back-end technology to power their own apps can build better products with features specific to iPhones and iPads.
Cause_General	Apple and Salesforce both have huge ecosystems of third-party software developers.
Cause_General	About 20 million developers make software for Apple devices, most of them focused on the consumer, while Salesforce has about 5 million developers who tap into its back-end systems to build business applications - a market that Apple has been expanding into through deals with International Business Machines (IBM.N), Cisco Systems (CSCO.O) and Accenture (ACN.N).
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The partnership means that a salesperson can use Siri after a customer meeting to update that customer’s record with notes from the meeting, flag a customer service issue for a support team to follow-up on and many other data-entry tasks that can eat up valuable time.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We’re going to be able to provide the sales rep instant access to things using your voice instead of clicks and going through different apps.
Distant_Evaluation	We’re changing the way people work, and that’s always been at the heart of what Apple is about - changing things for the better.”
Main	In exchange, Salesforce is building tools so companies that tap into its back-end systems can make better use of Apple-specific features like Siri.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At Salesforce’s annual customer conference this week, Marriott International will demonstrate a new system that uses Salesforce and Apple tools so that hotel guests can turn up the heat, order a sandwich or hail a ride using Siri with an Apple HomePod in their hotel room.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And at the next Marriot the guest stays at, Siri will remember the guest’s preferences - even their favorite sandwich, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff told Reuters in an interview.
Distant_Evaluation	“I don’t think I’ve met with a single customer in the world that doesn’t want me to help them do more with Tim’s products,” Benioff said Cook and Apple in the interview.
Distant_Evaluation	Salesforce also runs an educational platform called Trailhead, where it says one in four people who take courses in how to build business apps with Salesforce’s tools ends up getting a raise or promotion.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As part of the deal, Apple and Salesforce will add courses on how to develop iPhone and iPad applications.

Main	HOUSTON, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices rebound during the week ending Jan. 4, with the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for February delivery increasing by 5.8 percent and Brent crude for March delivery increasing by 9.3 percent.
Cause_General	In the previous week ending Dec. 28, oil prices went down slightly.
Cause_General	WTI decreased 0.57 percent, and Brent crude decreased 3.01 percent.
Cause_General	At the end of the week, WTI settled at 45.33 U.S. dollars a barrel, while Brent crude closed at 52.20 dollars a barrel.
Cause_Specific	On Monday, the last day of 2018, oil prices advanced amid positive signs of global trade prospects.
Cause_General	WTI gained 0.08 dollar to settle at 45.41 dollars a barrel, while Brent crude increased 0.59 dollar to close at 53.80 dollars a barrel.
Cause_General	Both oil benchmarks were down more than a third during the fourth quarter of 2018, the steepest decline since the fourth quarter of 2014.
Cause_General	For the year, U.S. crude has lost almost 25 percent, while Brent crude has lost nearly 20 percent.
Cause_Specific	On Wednesday, oil prices rallied amid signs that major oil producers have been cutting back on output.
Cause_General	WTI gained 1.13 dollars to settle at 46.54 dollars a barrel, while Brent crude increased 1.11 dollars to close at 54.91 dollars a barrel.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At a meeting in December, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some other major oil producers, including Russia, pledged to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day, effective from January 2019.
Cause_Specific	On Thursday, oil prices climbed in choppy trading after separate surveys indicated crude output in major oil producers declined.
Cause_General	WTI gained 0.55 dollar to settle at 47.09 dollars a barrel, while Brent crude increased 1.04 dollars to close at 55.95 dollars a barrel.
Cause_Specific	On Friday, oil prices rallied as the number of active U.S. rigs drilling for oil declined after two straight weeks of gains.
Cause_General	WTI gained 0.87 dollar to settle at 47.96 dollars a barrel, while Brent crude increased 1.11 dollars to close at 57.06 dollars a barrel.
Cause_Specific	The number of active drilling rigs in the United States decreased by eight to 1,075 during the week ending Jan. 4.
Cause_Specific	And the number of rigs operating in U.S. oil fields decreased by eight to a total of 877.
Cause_General	U.S. crude oil inventories remained virtually unchanged in the week ending Dec. 28.
Cause_General	At 441.4 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories were about 8 percent above the five-year average for this time of year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in a report on Friday.
Cause_General	EIA also reported that U.S. crude oil refinery inputs averaged 17.8 million barrels per day in the week, which was 410,000 barrels per day more than the previous week's average.
Cause_General	Looking back on the year of 2018, the prices for both crude oil benchmarks finished the year lower than they began it.
Cause_General	Brent crude oil ended the year at 54 U.S. dollars per barrel, 13 dollars per barrel lower than it began the year.
Cause_General	WTI ended the year at 45 dollars per barrel, 15 dollars per barrel lower than it began the year.
Distant_Evaluation	In the meantime, the market will wait to see the impacts of the daily 1.2-million-barrel supply cut deal between OPEC and its allies.
Distant_Evaluation	Despite the solid gains for both oil benchmarks in the first week of 2019, the market is paying close attention to the global economy as the United States and China will hold trade talks next week.
Main	DUBAI/ABU DHABI, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Creditors of Stanford Marine Group (SMG), which has links to troubled private equity firm Abraaj, are in talks with three potential buyers, sources familiar with the matter say.
Cause_Specific	Banks are overseeing control of Dubai-based SMG after it failed to meet the terms of its debt obligations due to financial stress linked to a steep fall in chartering rates, the sources said.
Cause_General	SMG, which operates offshore supply vessels that service the oil and gas industry, is 51 percent owned by a fund managed by Abraaj.
Cause_Specific	Dubai-based Abraaj filed for provisional liquidation in June after a row with investors over the use of their money in a $1 billion healthcare fund.
Distant_Evaluation	Abraaj denies any wrongdoing.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With Abraaj’s future uncertain, SMG’s creditors are likely to remain in the driving seat for the time being, the sources said.
Distant_Evaluation	A source close to Abu Dhabi-based Waha Capital, which owns the remaining 49 percent share in SMG, said Waha was “maintaining a dialogue with the banks.”
Distant_Evaluation	“SMG, like many other companies in the industry, is in discussion with its financiers with respect to its existing financing facilities,” SMG said in a statement to Reuters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“SMG’s financiers and shareholders continue to be supportive of the business and its management and look forward to continued future success.”
Cause_General	Abraaj’s joint provisional liquidators did not respond to a request for comment.
Cause_General	Waha also did not reply to a request for comment.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With SMG in negative equity, any sale of the company would leave banks with a haircut of at least 40 percent, two of the sources said.
Cause_General	Reuters was unable to verify the names of the potential buyers.
Cause_General	One of the sources said London-based funds were among the interested buyers, while another source said they included private equity firms and “strategic” investors.
Distant_Historical	From 2013 Abraaj was considering listing SMG on the stock market or selling it but the firm’s fortunes changed with the collapse in oil prices in 2015, which led to a dramatic fall in chartering rates and a drying up of projects.
Distant_Evaluation	SMG’s statement said it had demonstrated “resilient performance in the face of continued global downturn in the offshore marine industry with healthy demand for its fleet, leading to robust utilisation rates.”
Distant_Historical	The firm’s debt problems stem from a $325 million Islamic loan restructuring signed in June 2015 and provided by a group of banks including Noor Bank, Barwa Bank, Ajman Bank, United Arab Bank, Qatar Islamic Bank, and First Gulf Bank - now part of First Abu Dhabi Bank.
Cause_General	United States-based Fulcrum Capital, which has an office in Dubai, was among the companies that had looked at buying part of SMG’s bank debt, said two sources.
Cause_General	Fulcrum didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Error	REUTERS/Toby Melville/File Photo
Cause_General	Shares in the retailer, which has issued three profit warnings this year, plunged to a new low after it widened the remit of adviser KPMG to include “longer-term options” such as a possible Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA).
Cause_General	CVAs allow retailers to avoid insolvency or administration by offloading unwanted stores and securing reduced rents on others.
Cause_General	They have been adopted by British groups including fashion chain New Look, floor coverings retailer Carpetright, mother-and-baby goods company Mothercare and most recently home improvements chain Homebase.
Cause_General	Debenhams shares plunged as much as 19.5 percent to a new low of 10.34 pence on the news, despite the company saying it would meet profit and debt forecasts for its 2017-18 fiscal year
Distant_Evaluation	“The board continues to work with its advisers on longer term options, which include strengthening our balance sheet and reviewing non-core assets,” said Chairman Ian Cheshire.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“This activity is in order to maximise value for shareholders and protect other stakeholders, including our employees.”
Cause_General	Debenhams, which employs around 27,000 people globally, said in June it might sell non-core assets, including its Danish business, to bolster its finances and in July denied it was facing a cash crisis over supplier insurance.
Main	The group is in the second year of a turnaround plan under Chief Executive Sergio Bucher, a former Amazon executive, focused on closing up to 10 stores, downsizing 30 others and renegotiating leases and rents on 25 stores up for renewal over the next five years.
Main	It is also trying to cut promotions and improve its online service.
Cause_Specific	However, progress has been hampered by a squeeze on UK consumers’ budgets, a shift in spending away from fashion towards holidays and entertainment, and intense online competition.
Distant_Evaluation	Those trends have particularly damaged the department store sector.
Cause_General	BHS went bust in 2016, House of Fraser was bought out of administration last month by Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct and even market leader John Lewis has warned on profit.
Distant_Evaluation	‘CHALLENGING MARKET’
Distant_Evaluation	“The market environment remains challenging and underlying trends deteriorated through the summer months,” said Bucher.
Distant_Evaluation	“Nevertheless the product and format improvements we have tested are gaining traction and we are ready to scale up some of our strategic activity ahead of peak (selling season).”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Debenhams said it expected to report a 2017-18 pre-exceptional pretax profit of around 33 million pounds, within the current market range of 31-36.5 million pounds, and year-end net debt of about 320 million pounds, in line with guidance and retaining significant headroom on the firm’s medium term facilities of 520 million pounds.
Distant_Evaluation	It said the early weeks of the new season had shown “more positive trends.”
Cause_General	The stock was down 1.7 pence at 10.9 pence at 1345 GMT, valuing the business at about 135 million pounds.

Distant_Evaluation	THOMASVILLE, N.C. (Reuters) - In a town where a 30-feet tall chair is the chief landmark, and which is synonymous with a U.S. furniture industry decimated over the years by imports from China, many greet the possibility of tariffs on Chinese goods with a shrug.
Distant_Evaluation	No wonder.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Of three once bustling Thomasville furniture plants in the city limits, one is being demolished and cleared for parkland, another may become the site of a new police station, and a third is being converted into apartments.
Cause_Specific	President Donald Trump is threatening to levy tariffs of up to 25 percent on $500 billion of goods imported from China each year, including roughly $20 billion of furniture, as a way to bring back hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs lost to China and other low-cost competitors.
Main	Yet, the transformation of U.S. industries since China’s emergence as the world’s low-cost producer almost two decades ago means many no longer directly compete with Chinese imports, so tariffs may not translate so easily into more U.S. jobs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At family-owned Bernhardt Furniture in Lenoir, some 90 miles west of Thomasville, executives say it would take about $30 million in capital investment - some 10 percent of annual sales - to resurrect standard wood furniture lines now mainly made in countries like China and Vietnam.
Distant_Evaluation	That is too much to commit based on a policy that a future administration could reverse.
Distant_Evaluation	“The theory is you turn (imports) off, the jobs come back.
Distant_Evaluation	That’s not really true...
Distant_Evaluation	The buildings don’t exist.
Distant_Evaluation	The people don’t exist.
Distant_Evaluation	The machinery does not exist,” to make the sorts of furniture that now gets imported, said Alex Bernhardt Jr., chief executive and the company founder’s great grandson.
Distant_Evaluation	What the company needs now, executives say, is the open markets and steady economy that have allowed it to grow its workforce from below 800 at the end of the 2007-2009 recession to almost 1,500 today - partly on the basis of exports to China.
Cause_General	DIFFERENT COMPANY
Cause_General	That growth has been largely driven by demand for more customized, higher end furniture.
Cause_General	In expanding, the 129-year-old company has been hiring not only factory workers, but also designers, marketing experts and other professionals.
Cause_General	In all, it is a different firm from what it was three decades ago when it first began dividing product lines between the United States and Asia.

Distant_Evaluation	Economists say the same is true across much of U.S. manufacturing.
Distant_Evaluation	To invest and hire more workers, executives would need certainty, for example, that consumers would prefer U.S.-made products at a potentially higher price.
Distant_Evaluation	They would need confidence that tariffs would last beyond the Trump administration and that production could not be shifted to other more cost-competitive countries.
Distant_Evaluation	Even then, there may be little incentive to go back to old product lines for industries that have changed dramatically because of globalization.
Distant_Evaluation	Across the Rust Belt and the former factory towns of the south, the transformation is apparent.
Distant_Anecdotal	In Buffalo, an old steel mill is now a solar panel factory, and a retail goods manufacturer now houses an office and restaurant park.
Distant_Anecdotal	Near Dayton, Ohio, a shuttered GM plant has reopened as a Chinese-owned auto glass company.
Distant_Evaluation	Abandoned factories throughout North Carolina have landed on the Environmental Protection Agency’s list of “brownfield” sites that need cleanup.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some companies are considering moving production from China as a result of the tariffs, but the jobs are unlikely to head home.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Illinois-based CCTY Bearing, for example, said it planned to move U.S.-bound production from Zhenjiang, China, to a new plant near Mumbai in India to keep labor costs down.
Distant_Evaluation	JLab Audio’s China-made Bluetooth products are not being taxed yet, but its chief executive Win Cramer had been scouting for suppliers in Vietnam and Mexico.
Distant_Evaluation	“I would love to build products onshore, but consumers have proven time and time again that “Made in America” isn’t as valuable a statement as it once was,” Cramer said.
Distant_Evaluation	“They make decisions based on the cost.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The price of, say, its Bluetooth earbud would jump from $20 to as much as $50 if it was made in the United States, Cramer said, far more than what tariffs would add to the cost of imports.
Distant_Evaluation	To be sure, early reactions suggest that foreign companies that make U.S.-bound goods in China may move some of that production to the United States.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Still, countries such as Vietnam may ultimately benefit the most from Trump’s tariffs.

Cause_General	Japanese construction and mining equipment maker Komatsu Ltd < 6301.T > has said it has already shifted some of its production of parts for U.S.-built excavators from China.
Cause_General	Part of that production moved to the United States, but some also went to Mexico and Japan.
Cause_General	In South Korea, LG Electronics (066570.KS) and its rival Samsung Electronics (005930.KS) are considering moving parts of U.S.-bound refrigerator and air conditioner production to Mexico, Vietnam or back home, but not to the United States, according to company sources and local media.
Distant_Evaluation	STEADY RECOVERY
Distant_Evaluation	The responses to Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum show how such steps create both winners and losers.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Producers such as U.S. Steel and Century Aluminum have said they will add at least several hundred jobs as a result of the higher prices they can charge.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mid-Continental Nail, however, laid off 130 workers because of those higher steel prices, and furniture parts maker Leggett & Platt (LEG.N) has warned that rising metal prices would prompt it to shift production abroad.
Cause_Specific	So far, Washington has imposed duties on $250 billion of Chinese imports and Trump has threatened to slap tariffs on all Chinese goods.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Many economists project new tariffs would on balance either slow down hiring or cause job losses in a manufacturing sector where employment has grown by 10 percent over the past eight years without special protection.

Cause_General	The furniture industry, among the hardest hit by Chinese imports, has added 43,000 jobs since its employment hit a low of 350,000 in 2011, helped by the recovering housing market and strong consumer demand.
Distant_Evaluation	Industry officials say skilled upholsterers and other workers are hard to find, echoing the Federal Reserve’s concern about the impact of worker shortages on the U.S. economy.
Distant_Evaluation	In Thomasville, few expect that tariffs will bring furniture manufacturing back to its heyday, nor does the community need it, says city manager Kelly Craver, whose parents worked in the furniture and textile industries.
Cause_General	Since the recession, Thomasville has become a residential hub for growing nearby cities such as Greensboro and Charlotte.
Cause_General	It also has its own mix of manufacturing and white collar jobs.
Cause_General	Mohawk Industries (MHK.N) recently expanded its Thomasville laminate flooring facility while the Old Dominion Freight Line transportation firm (ODFL.O) and the fast-growing Cook Out burger chain have corporate headquarters there.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We, for the very first time in this city’s existence, are going to have a diversified economy,” Craver said.

Cause_General	Yet the unemployment rate went up to 3.9 percent, which was highest level since July, 2018.
Cause_General	Job gains occurred in health care, food services and drinking places, construction, manufacturing, and retail trade, the bureau said.

Main	TOKYO, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- A bluefin tuna was sold on Saturday for a record 333.6 million yen (3.1 million U.S. dollars) at the first new year auction at the Toyosu fish market in Tokyo, Japan, local media reported.
Cause_General	The 278-kilogram tuna was fetched in Oma, Aomori Prefecture and cost 1.2 million yen (11,057 dollars) per kilogram.
Cause_General	The total price beat all the records of first new year biddings at the metropolitan central market since 1999 when records began.
Distant_Historical	The market was relocated from nearby Tsukiji last year, a famous destination among both tourists and local Japanese for its fresh seafood.
Distant_Evaluation	It is customary for bidders to pay a high price at the first auction of each year, particularly this year as it was the first held at the new market since it opened in October.
Cause_General	Kiyomura Corp., a Tokyo-based operator of sushi restaurant chain Sushizanmai, successfully bid for the tuna this year.
Cause_General	The company was the highest bidder at Tsukiji for six consecutive new year's auctions through 2017 and held the previous record of 155.4 million yen (1.43 million dollars) for a 222-kilogram tuna in 2013.
Cause_General	The final new year's auction at Tsukiji in 2018 saw a tuna fetch 36.45 million yen (335,852 dollars).
Distant_Historical	The Tokyo metropolitan government decided in 2001 to relocate the aging Tsukiji market to Toyosu, a new tourist attraction in Tokyo, as it is suited for controlling temperatures and sanitation and is 1.7 times larger than Tsukiji.

Main	WASHINGTON, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- An index indicated a moderation in the upward trend of U.S. economic growth, though the economy is still expanding, the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) of Philadelphia said on Thursday.
Cause_Specific	The Philadelphia Fed's U.S. index, a coincident index to summarize multiple economic indicators with one single reading, rose by 0.18 percent to hit 124.8 in November.
Cause_Specific	The November growth rate of the index was lower than the growth rate of 0.21 percent in the previous month, signaling that the upward trend in U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) was moderating.
Cause_General	The coincident index combines four key economic indicators, including nonfarm payroll employment, average hours worked in manufacturing by production workers, the unemployment rate, and wage and salary disbursements deflated by the consumer price index.
Cause_General	At the state level, the coincident indexes rose in 43 states in November, dropped in three states, and remained flat in four others.
Cause_General	Over the past three months, the index increased in 47 states and dropped in three states.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Federal Reserve recently revised down its forecast for U.S. economic growth in 2019 to 2.3 percent from the previous projection of 2.5 percent.
Main	WUXI, China/LONDON (Reuters) - With smart cancer diagnostics, one-stop-shop diabetes kits and AI systems to improve ambulance pick-ups for patients with chest pain, AstraZeneca (AZN.L) aims to move from simply supplying drugs to become a broad healthcare provider in China.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Tech tie-ups with the likes of Alibaba (BABA.N) and Tencent (0700.HK) will not directly lift the British group’s drug sales, since they are not specific for any one company’s products and in many cases will be low-cost or free.
Main	But it will expand the overall market and represents a soft power play that dovetails neatly with Beijing’s support for Internet-based healthcare systems to alleviate a lack of doctors, overcrowding and poor grassroots healthcare.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Down the line we benefit, our products benefit, because we have better relationships with doctors and hospital managers and also because we diagnose more patients and they get better treated,” Chief Executive Pascal Soriot told Reuters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Surrounded by the latest gizmos at the World Internet of Things Exposition in Wuxi, eastern China, Soriot says he wants to use the power of artificial intelligence, robots and apps to help transform diagnosis and disease management.
Cause_General	AstraZeneca has been on a tear in China, more than doubling its sales since 2012, helped by regulatory reforms to fast-track new drugs, and today generates 18 percent of revenue in the country — a far higher proportion than rivals.
Distant_Evaluation	Yet Soriot is anxious to do more to keep doctors and government officials on-side in the world’s second-biggest drugs market, as soaring demand strains the state insurance system and squeezes medicine prices.
Distant_Evaluation	The company’s underlying conviction is that it has the right medicines across chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes and respiratory disorders to win in China.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Soriot believes that can keep AstraZeneca growing in a pivotal market in the coming years, even though annual growth is likely to slow to nearer 15 percent from the breakneck 33 percent seen in the first half of 2018.
Distant_Evaluation	The company has moved quickly to exploit China’s new-found willingness to use innovative Western drugs.
Distant_Historical	Last year it won a record-fast approval for lung cancer pill Tagrisso, which is designed for patients with a genetic mutation that is particularly common in China.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It hopes to get a green light before the end of 2018 — well before U.S. approval — for a new anemia drug called roxadustat being developed with FibroGen (FGEN.O).
Distant_Evaluation	China-first approvals for drugs like roxadustat and Elunate, a colorectal cancer treatment from Eli Lilly (LLY.N) and Hutchison China MediTech (HCM.L), mark a reversal of the historical pattern of Chinese patients getting new drugs years after their launch in the West.

Distant_Evaluation	There is, however, a trade-off.
Cause_General	Multinationals that relied in the past on selling older drugs at premium prices in China are seeing prices slashed.
Distant_Historical	AstraZeneca took a 50 percent haircut last year on the price of Iressa, its predecessor to Tagrisso.
Distant_Evaluation	“The government wants to give access to better medicines to more people,” said Soriot, who admitted that pressure on prices had come sooner than he expected.
Distant_Evaluation	“To some extent the economy is growing so there is more money to do that, but there is not enough money ...
Distant_Evaluation	They have to make room in the budget for innovation.”
Distant_Evaluation	“UNMET NEEDS”
Cause_General	With 1.4 billion people, around 18 percent of the world’s population, China has more cases of cancer and diabetes than any other nation, fueled by fast food, smoking and pollution, global health data show.
Distant_Evaluation	“There are enormous unmet medical needs in China, particularly in oncology, and 30 percent of the world’s cancer patients are in China,” Christian Hogg, Chief Executive of Hutchison China MediTech, told Reuters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“There is almost an inevitability that the Chinese pharmaceutical industry is going to grow to be the largest in the world in due course.”
Cause_General	The firm, also known as Chi-Med, is working with AstraZeneca on a novel oncology drug targeting kidney, lung and stomach tumors.
Distant_Evaluation	AstraZeneca is bolstering its sales force to meet this growing demand.
Cause_General	It has around 7,500 sales staff in China and is looking to push into smaller cities — boosting volume and helping offset lower prices.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It aims to get more drugs onto a list of medicines covered by basic insurance schemes — the national drug reimbursement list — and onto fast-track approvals, Soriot said.
Distant_Historical	The list was most recently updated last year after an eight-year hiatus.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A drug joint venture, Dizal Pharmaceutical, backed by the China State Development & Investment Corporation, will promote Chinese-discovered drugs — another priority for Beijing.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s the first time a government fund works with a foreign company in researching new drugs for Chinese patients,” Leon Wang, AstraZeneca’s China head, said in an interview at the firm’s Shanghai headquarters.
Distant_Evaluation	“So we like that.”
Distant_Evaluation	Wang added there were still many patients who went undiagnosed or untreated, and that the firm’s aggressive expansion, even to “village clinics”, was helping make the difference against rivals tapping growing demand.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Chronic disease, oncology drugs, specialty care, rare disease, these will all explode I think,” he said.

Main	(Reuters) - Papa John’s International Inc (PZZA.O), the world’s third-largest pizza delivery company, has reached out to potential acquirers to ask them to submit offers, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

Cause_General	Papa John’s has come under pressure by founder John Schnatter, who owns about 30 percent of the company.
Cause_Specific	He resigned as chairman in July following reports that he had used a racial slur on a media training conference call.
Cause_General	Since then, Schnatter has been seeking ways to regain control.
Main	Papa John’s sent out information this week about an auction to sell itself to other companies and private equity firms, and expects to receive first-round bids by the end of October, the sources said.
Distant_Evaluation	There is no certainty of a sale, and Papa John’s could also explore an alternative deal, such as receiving an investment, one of the sources added.
Cause_General	The sources asked not to be identified because the matter was confidential.
Cause_General	Papa John’s declined to comment.
Cause_General	Reuters first reported last month that the company had hired Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N) to prepare the ground for a sale.
Cause_General	Papa John’s shares ended trading on Wednesday up 8.5 percent at $50.14, giving the company a market value of close to $1.6 billion.
Distant_Evaluation	Separately, Schnatter on Wednesday denied a CNBC report that said he had reached out to private equity firms about making an offer for Papa John’s.
Distant_Evaluation	“Any such report about a potential transaction involving Mr Schnatter is totally and completely false.
Distant_Evaluation	It is unfortunate that CNBC published this false story without first contacting Mr Schnatter to obtain the true facts,” a spokesman for Schnatter said in an emailed statement.
Distant_Evaluation	A CNBC spokesman said that the business news TV channel stood by its reporting.
Distant_Evaluation	Papa John’s has adopted a so-called poison pill defense to discourage a hostile takeover.
Cause_General	Schnatter sued the pizza chain’s board and chief executive at the end of August to stop what he described as “the irreparable harm” they are causing the company, according to a court filing.
Cause_General	Last month, Papa John’s posted a second-quarter comparable sales decline of 6.1 percent and cut its sales forecast, citing fallout from the company’s split with Schnatter.
Distant_Evaluation	Negative publicity surrounding Schnatter depressed July traffic in North America, the company said at the time, noting it was hard to predict how long and how badly that would affect sales.
Cause_General	Papa John’s has more than 5,000 locations worldwide, mostly franchised restaurants.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Papa John’s Chief Executive Officer Steve Ritchie has vowed to move beyond the fight with Schnatter with a new advertising and marketing campaign, while also removing Schnatter’s image from company promotions.
Distant_Evaluation	Two franchisee associations working with the company have expressed support for its strategy.
Distant_Historical	Ritchie, previously Papa John’s president, took over as CEO in January.
Distant_Historical	Schnatter came under fire in November for criticizing the National Football League’s leadership over national anthem protests by players.
Distant_Evaluation	Dealmaking in the restaurant sector is heating up.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Arby’s-owner Inspire Brands Inc said on Tuesday it would buy Sonic Corp SONC.O for about $1.57 billion in cash, adding more than 3,600 drive-in restaurants to its portfolio that includes brands such as Buffalo Wild Wings and Rusty Taco.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	For the two bidders for Clear Channel Communications, the third time may be the charm.
Main	The company, which owns the largest radio network in the nation, agreed yesterday to accept a revised buyout offer from Bain Capital and Thomas H. Lee Partners, potentially clinching a deal that had eluded the two private equity firms for months.
Distant_Evaluation	Unlike the previous offers, the latest one was drawn up with guidance by several shareholders, Scott Sperling, managing director of Thomas H. Lee, said yesterday.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We were guided to this spot by the shareholders,"" Mr. Sperling said, specifically highlighting the roles played by Highfields Capital Management and Fidelity Investments in reaching the new deal."
Cause_General	Investors will receive $39.20 a share.
Cause_General	Alternatively, they have the option of rolling their holdings into a cumulative 30 percent stake in the newly private Clear Channel, in what is known as stub equity.
Cause_General	The portion available to investors is worth about $1.2 billion, but no shareholder may hold more than 9.9 percent of the new company.
Cause_General	Bain and Thomas H. Lee have also agreed to limit their fees from the deal, as well as to allow for two independent directors for the new company.
Cause_General	Highfields will choose one, while the other shareholders will elect the other, according to people briefed on the negotiations.
Distant_Evaluation	A spokesman for Calpers, the California public employee pension fund, said it supported the latest offer; Calpers holds 3.3 million shares of Clear Channel.
Distant_Evaluation	''What we focus on is what will get the highest value for our members,'' the spokesman, Brad Pacheco, said.
Cause_General	Shares of Clear Channel closed at $38.23 yesterday, up 1.2 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	The deal is substantially the same that Bain and Thomas H. Lee offered earlier this month -- and that Clear Channel initially rejected.
Cause_Specific	But a few days later, several institutional investors, including Highfields, a hedge fund, urged the company to take more time to consider the offer.
Cause_Specific	After Clear Channel's announcement on May 7 that it would reconsider the revised buyout offer, the company took about a week before agreeing to the new bid.
Distant_Evaluation	The six-month-long contest illustrates the increased assertiveness of public investors, as private equity firms have acquired scores of companies.
Cause_General	In the bidding for Clear Channel, the power of shareholders was amplified by the law in Texas, where the company is based.
Cause_General	Under that state's regulations, approval of a buyout requires the support of two-thirds of all shareholders -- not just those voting.
Cause_Specific	Shortly after Clear Channel announced its first agreement with the buyout firms, at $37.60 a share in cash, several major shareholders, as well as proxy advisory firms, complained that the company was being sold too cheaply.
Cause_Specific	The bidders raised their offer to $39, which Clear Channel accepted, but the offer again met resistance from investors.
Cause_Specific	But after Clear Channel's initial rejection of the third buyout bid, the company received worried phone calls from scores of investors.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Though some technical details remain unresolved, the deal is expected to go through.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Clear Channel said it would postpone a vote on the deal, originally scheduled for a special meeting on May 22.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The company will instead set a new record date and a new vote, which will probably take place within the next three months, pending the filing of amended registration materials with federal regulators.
Main	THE dollar fell against many currencies in 2006, and many Wall Street analysts are predicting more of the same this year.
Distant_Evaluation	That needn't worry investors, who could profit from a continued decline in many ways.
Distant_Evaluation	But some strategists caution that it may be wiser to try to benefit indirectly from a weaker dollar -- by holding stocks or stock funds focused on certain industries and countries -- than by betting directly on foreign currencies.
Distant_Evaluation	''You've got to know your limitations,'' said Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's.
Distant_Evaluation	''Unless you make millions of dollars on Wall Street, you probably shouldn't be speculating in currencies.''
Cause_General	In 2006, the dollar fell 10.2 percent against the euro and 12 percent against the British pound, although it rose 1.1 percent against the Japanese yen.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Stovall said the best move for most individual investors would be to stock up on the shares of American multinational corporations that earn a lot of their revenues abroad, as well as on foreign stocks.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''We feel that many foreign economies are not as far along in their economic cycle, and they have good growth potential now,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	He recommended that individual investors allocate 40 percent of their total portfolios to domestic stocks, 20 percent to foreign stocks, 25 percent to domestic bonds and 15 percent to cash instruments like money market accounts and certificates of deposit.
Distant_Evaluation	In terms of domestic stocks, he favors large stocks like those in the S.& P. 500- stock index.
Cause_General	On average, the companies in this index earn 41 percent of their revenue in foreign countries.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''If you believe that international economies are going to do fairly well, and the dollar is likely to weaken,'' Mr. Stovall said, ''then you could get a good bit of tailwind if you transfer those foreign profits back to U.S.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	dollars.''
Distant_Evaluation	But averages can hide wide variances.
Cause_General	Some industries represented in the S.& P. 500 draw much more of their revenue abroad than others.
Cause_General	Companies in the energy and technology sectors, for example, generate well over half of their sales outside the United States, while the utilities and telecommunications companies in the index produce a vast majority of their revenue at home.
Cause_General	For example, the handful of telecommunications providers in the index get just 3 percent of their revenue, on average, in foreign countries.
Distant_Evaluation	Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, has recommended European stocks for a few years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He said that individual investors should now focus on developed markets -- and that if they have made a lot of money in emerging markets funds in recent years, they may want to consider rebalancing their portfolios.
Distant_Evaluation	''You have to be a little bit concerned that emerging-markets debt and equity may have gotten a bit ahead of themselves,'' he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Schweitzer said that any further appreciation of the euro could be modest this year.
Distant_Evaluation	Still, he added, European stocks were appealing investments for a host of other reasons.
Cause_General	He pointed out that the average dividend yield in the S.& P. 500 index was now 1.8 percent, compared with 3.2 percent for the MSCI United Kingdom index and 2.5 percent for the MSCI Europe index, excluding Britain.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	For Americans investing in Britain or on the continent, a further slide by the dollar against the pound or the euro could bolster those dividend advantages.
Distant_Evaluation	''Meanwhile, European companies are cutting costs and restructuring, and that's starting to show up in their earnings growth,'' Mr. Schweitzer said.
Cause_General	Earnings per share for European stocks, he said, grew almost twice as fast in the first five years of this decade as they did during the last five years of the 1990s.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On the fixed-income side of their portfolios, some investors may be tempted to profit directly from a falling dollar by buying foreign bonds or CDs.
Distant_Evaluation	But Martin J. Mauro, the fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, said he didn't think the time was ripe for investing in foreign bonds.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Interest rates are likely to fall in the United States this year but rise in many other countries, Mr. Mauro said.
Distant_Evaluation	Bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates, so both European and Asian bonds would generally be unattractive for American investors, he said.
Main	Many economists predict that the dollar will fall further against the Japanese yen than it will against the euro -- largely because the dollar rose slightly against the yen in 2006.
Main	S.& P. forecasts a dollar decline of 6.8 percent against the yen this year; Merrill Lynch sees a decline of 10 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	But Mr. Mauro said American investors would be giving up too much yield if they bought Japanese bonds or CDs.
Cause_General	Short-term interest rates are less than 1 percent in Japan, versus 5 percent in the United States.
Main	And Mr. Mauro said he expected the dollar to fall by only an additional 1 percent or so against the euro -- which he said wouldn't be quite enough to make up for the yield that Americans would sacrifice by buying European bonds or CDs.
Cause_General	One-year government bills in the United States currently pay around 5 percent, versus 3.9 percent in Germany.
Distant_Evaluation	For now, he recommends high-quality domestic bonds.
Distant_Evaluation	He said typical individual investors should put at most 5 percent of their bond portfolios into high-yield bonds, and none into emerging-market debt.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Although short-term rates are relatively high, he recommends intermediate maturities -- 5 to 15 years -- because he expects domestic interest rates to be lower next year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''If we're right, and the economy weakens and the Fed cuts rates, then what investors will earn on short-term rates will be a lot less next year,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's a tough move to make now, but they'll be better off a year from now'' if they buy longer-maturity bonds or CDs today.
Distant_Evaluation	FINALLY, if investors are really worried about the dollar, Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, advises them to put about 5 percent of their portfolios into gold.
Distant_Evaluation	He recommends buying the metal through an exchange-traded fund like StreetTracks Gold Shares or the iShares Comex Gold Trust -- both of which are backed by bars of gold in a vault.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He predicted that gold could rise as much as 20 percent in 2007, to around $750 an ounce.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A falling dollar, Mr. Metz said, may prompt foreign central banks to sell some their dollar reserves to buy gold.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He also said that rising incomes across Asia could become a factor.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''The great theme of this century,'' he said, ''will be the enormous transfer of wealth to developing nations, where they have traditionally used gold as a store of value.''

Main	BEIJING, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- China's social net wealth, an important gauge of overall national strength, totaled 437 trillion yuan (63.48 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2016, ranking only second to the United States, a report showed.
Cause_General	By the end of 2016, China had 424 trillion yuan in domestic non-financial assets and 13 trillion yuan in external net assets, according to a report released Wednesday by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
Cause_General	The total net wealth was equivalent to 70.7 percent of the U.S. wealth level during the same period, ranking second in the world.
Cause_General	In 2016, 73 percent of the country's social net wealth was owned by residents, while the remaining 27 percent was held by the government, functioning as a strong buttress for China to counter financial risks.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	To improve net wealth productivity, the report calls for improving production efficiency for non-financial firms, cutting inefficient investment and shifting away from investment-led growth model.

Main	HANOI, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam achieved gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 7.08 percent in 2018, the highest rate over the past 10 years, up from the annualized target of 6.5-6.7 percent, its General Statistics Office said on Thursday.
Cause_Specific	In the fourth quarter alone, the GDP expanded 7.31 percent against the same period last year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Vietnam's top legislature has set a target of attaining GDP growth of 6.6-6.8 percent next year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In October, the World Bank predicted Vietnam's economy would expand 6.6 percent in 2019 and 6.5 percent in 2020.
Cause_General	In 2018, Vietnam reaped export turnovers of over 244.7 billion U.S. dollars, up 13.8 percent against 2017, and import turnovers of more than 237.5 billion U.S. dollars, up 11.5 percent, posting a trade surplus of 7.2 billion U.S. dollars.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, its consumer price index (CPI), which measures changes in the prices paid by consumers for a basket of 11 goods and services, rose 3.54 percent, far below the target of 4 percent, said the office.
Main	PARIS (Reuters) - BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA), France’s largest listed bank, beat second-quarter profit forecasts on Wednesday as its global business offset a sharp fixed income trading fall and domestic weakness.
Error	FILE PHOTO: A BNP Paribas logo is seen at a bank in Paris, France, April 6, 2018.

Cause_Specific	A surge in BNP’s international financial services business, including consumer lending, insurance and its U.S. bank BancWest, helped it recover from a weak first quarter when net profit plunged to 1.57 billion euros ($1.84 billion).
Cause_Specific	Although second quarter net profit fell 0.1 percent to 2.39 billion euros from 2.4 billion euros a year before, this was above a median profit of 2.07 billion euros from four analysts polled by consultancy Inquiry Financial for Reuters.
Cause_Specific	Group revenue rose 2.5 percent year-on-year to 11.21 billion euros, compared with a median forecast of around 10.9 billion euros, while revenue from corporate and investment banking fell 6.8 percent due to continuing weakness in fixed-income trading.
Distant_Evaluation	BNP Paribas shares were up 0.2 percent at 0728 GMT and some analysts said the results were reassuring.
Distant_Evaluation	“Strong numbers across the board, their results are reassuring more than anything else,” said Sam Dawson, a Monaco-based analyst at investment bank Wood & Company.
Cause_General	Last month major Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) reported higher profits, although Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) last week reported a drop in quarterly earnings.
Cause_Specific	BNP said the weakness in fixed-income trading was due to certain factors in the European market, such as persistently low interest rates.
Cause_Specific	The corporate and investment banking division was also hit by a weaker dollar.
Cause_Specific	While low interest rates have hit parts of its investment banking business, they have conversely buoyed other businesses such as consumer lending and life insurance.
Distant_Evaluation	“Revenue driven by the specialized businesses increased in the context of economic growth in Europe, despite an unfavorable exchange effect and less favorable financial markets than in the second quarter of 2017,” BNP Paribas chief executive Jean-Laurent Bonnafe said in a statement.
Cause_Specific	Solid economic growth in the United States also lifted BancWest’s profits.
Cause_Specific	Revenue from the U.S. bank rose 22 percent in U.S. dollar terms, or 12 percent when translated into euros.
Cause_General	The strong performance at the international financial services arm also mitigated weakness in BNP Paribas’ French retail bank, where revenues fell during the quarter.
Main	(Reuters) - United Technologies Corp (UTX.N) is exploring a sale of its Chubb Fire & Security division for more than $3 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.

Error	REUTERS/Brendan McDermid
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On Sept. 14, United Technologies CEO Greg Hayes said the company will announce a decision within 60 days about whether to break up.
Cause_General	The company’s main business lines are comprised of aerospace engines, elevators and building equipment such as air conditioners.
Cause_General	Chubb was acquired by United Technologies for about $1 billion in 2003, and is now part of the company’s climate, controls and security division.
Cause_General	It has been playing catch-up for market share with rivals Securitas AB (SECUb.ST) and Tyco International Ltd. Tyco was acquired by Johnson Controls International Plc (JCI.N) two years ago for $16.5 billion.
Cause_General	United Technologies, based in Farmington, Connecticut, has hired Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) to run an auction for Chubb, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential and cautioning that no deal is certain.
Cause_General	United Technologies did not respond to a request for comment, while Bank of America declined to comment.
Cause_General	United Technologies, maker of Pratt & Whitney engines, Carrier air conditioners and Otis elevators, has a market capitalization of approximately $113 billion.
Cause_General	Chubb, headquartered in Britain, provides fire safety and security solutions for businesses and organizations around the world, although its business is predominantly in Europe.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Hayes said at an investor conference this month that United Technologies planned to close its pending $23 billion acquisition of aerospace parts maker Rockwell Collins COL.N by the end of this month.
Cause_General	That deal has been held up by China delaying regulatory approval, amid an escalating trade row with the United States.
Distant_Evaluation	Investors have increasingly shunned sprawling industrial conglomerates, forcing peers such as General Electric Co (GE.N) and Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) to also announce the sale or spinout of major divisions.
Distant_Evaluation	Activist investor Bill Ackman’s hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management LP and Daniel Loeb’s hedge fund Third Point LLC have been putting pressure on United Technologies to break up into three focused, standalone businesses.

Main	BERLIN (Reuters) - German retailer Metro AG plans to sell its struggling Real hypermarkets and is confident of interest in the chain, though bankers played down talk it might attract Amazon and a price tag of up to 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).
Error	FILE PHOTO: German retailer Metro AG sign is seen on the headquarters in Duesseldorf, Germany March 02, 2018.
Error	REUTERS/Thilo Schmuelgen/File Photo
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Industry bankers contacted by Reuters said private equity firms were the most likely bidders and that Metro might have to effectively pay a buyer to take the chain off its hands.
Cause_General	Foreign players have shunned the cut-throat German grocery market, which is dominated by discounters Aldi and Lidl, since Walmart took a loss of $1 billion when it sold its stores to Metro and pulled out of the country in 2006.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Metro says it wants to focus on its wholesale business which serves independent traders, hotels and restaurants and is more shielded from ecommerce, while doing more delivery to customers.
Distant_Evaluation	“The fact that we repeatedly had expressions of interest shows that we can take up the journey again,” Metro’s chief executive Olaf Koch told journalists on Friday.
Distant_Historical	Metro previously tried to sell Real in 2012 and a consortium of Apollo and Towerbrook made an offer, as did KKR, before the retailer opted instead to restructure the chain.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Koch expected the sales process to take up to eight months.
Distant_Evaluation	HSBC’s European retail analyst, Andrew Porteous, welcomed the plan and raised his price target for Metro shares to 14 euros from 11.50 euros.
Distant_Evaluation	“Increased focus is a positive,” he said in a note.
Distant_Evaluation	“We have consistently held that Metro needed to simplify in order to create value.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Large European retailers such as Ahold, Carrefour, Auchan, Tesco are unlikely to bid for Real, people familiar with the industry said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The chain may attract more interest from investors such as Apollo-backed Alteri, owner of Babywalz and CBR Fashion Group or from other private equity firms.
Distant_Evaluation	Buyout groups, have had mixed results though with retail in Germany and several deals - such as Sun Capital’s Neckermann investment - have turned sour.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some analysts speculated Amazon could be interested after its acquisition of U.S. grocery chain Whole Foods last year.
Cause_General	Germany is its second biggest market after the United States.
Distant_Evaluation	“Germany’s grocery ecommerce is very underdeveloped and Germany is a very important country for Amazon,” said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, adding a price of around 1 billion euros would be no hurdle for the ecommerce giant.
Cause_General	An Amazon spokesman declined to comment and the buyout groups named either declined to comment or were not immediately available.
Cause_General	FINDING A BUYER
Distant_Evaluation	Real has suffered from tough competition from the advance of online players like Amazon and has sought to build up an online grocery business in recent years.
Cause_General	Its ecommerce still only accounts for 2 percent of its 7.2 billion euro sales.
Cause_General	The business posted a loss and saw sales slide 7.2 percent in the latest quarter, which it blamed on an early Easter and unusually hot weather.
Distant_Evaluation	Bankers do not view Real as high on Amazon’s shopping list.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	One said Real could be sold for “near zero at best”, while another said Metro may have to pay to offload the business.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Koch said selling Real was not connected to Daniel Kretinsky buying a stake in Metro last month, although he said the company had met the Czech billionaire, whose move prompted speculation he could make a full bid and take Metro private.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Analysts said a financial investor might be interested in the real estate value of the 65 hypermarkets that Real owns, while other options could be a sale of parcels of stores to chains like Lidl or dominant supermarket group Edeka.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, peers need to tread carefully to avoid anti-trust concerns like those that dogged Edeka’s purchase of loss-making chain Kaiser’s in 2015.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	One of the bankers said fellow German supermarket chain Kaufland, held by Lidl owner Schwarz Group, could show an interest in some sites.
Distant_Evaluation	Koch told journalists the aim was to sell Real as a whole rather than as a bundle of stores.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Trade union Verdi criticized Metro’s treatment of Real’s 34,000 workers in recent years and said the company should be sold as a whole.

Distant_Evaluation	“First the workforce forwent part of their wages ... then the company shredded the collective bargaining agreement, and now Real is going to be sold,” said Stefanie Nutzenberger from Verdi.
Cause_General	In focusing its business, Metro has already sold its Kaufhof department stores and split from consumer electronics retailer Ceconomy.
Distant_Historical	Real’s stores in eastern Europe were sold to French retailer Auchan in 2012.
Cause_General	Metro’s shares closed down 1.2 percent in Frankfurt at 13.51 euros.

Main	BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A spokesperson of China's Ministry of Commerce (MOC) said Tuesday that if the United States loses its rationality and unveils another list of Chinese products for additional tariffs, China will have no choice but to take comprehensive measures combining quantitative and qualitative ones to resolutely strike back.
Cause_Specific	After unveiling plans to impose additional tariffs on Chinese goods worth around 50 billion U.S. dollars, the United States went even further by threatening to identify 200 billion U.S. dollars worth of Chinese products for additional tariffs.
Main	"""Such practice of imposing extreme pressure and blackmailing is contrary to the consensus the two sides have reached through rounds of consultations, and disappoints the international community,"" the spokesperson said."
Main	"""The trade war waged by the United States is against both the law of the market and the development trend of today' s world."

Main	BERLIN, Aug. 22 (Xinhua) -- German companies are planning to ramp up their investments on the African continent during the coming years, president of the German-African Business Association Stefan Liebing announced on Wednesday.
Cause_General	"""We are already witnessing a significant increase in the investment- and trading activity with our neighboring continent,"" Liebing told reporters."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	According to an estimate by the association, new investments by German companies in Africa will rise by more than 10 percent to a total of more than one billion euros (1.15 billion U.S. dollars).
Distant_Evaluation	Liebing explained that at least part of the increase reflected recent changes in the German regulatory landscape.
Cause_General	Back in June, the German government announced that it would ease the conditions which must be met for domestic small- and mid-sized enterprises (SMEs) to access export guarantees in trade with certain African countries.
Distant_Evaluation	Thomas Bareiss, secretary of state in the ministry for the economy, said at the time that closer economic ties between Germany and African nations were a key priority of Chancellor Angela Merkel's governing cabinet.
Cause_General	Towards this end, Berlin has taken steps to lower the insurance excess shouldered by these firms or the banks they work with in international trade between Germany and African states.
Cause_General	The new regulations apply to countries which have joined a G20 initiative for more international investment and were SMEs previously faced relatively steep deductible rates of up to 5 percent.
Cause_General	Amongst others, German exporters operating in the African markets of Cote D'Ivoire, Senegal, Ethiopia, Ghana and Rwanda stand to benefit from the expansion of government guarantees.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Commenting on the development on Wednesday, Liebing expressed confidence that the change would boost trade and capital flows between Germany and Africa.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It's working."
Distant_Evaluation	"A large number of projects have been successfully realized (as a consequence of the new policy regime),"" Liebing said."
Cause_General	He noted that the volume of export guarantees for Africa more than doubled during the first six months of the year to 1.09 billion euros (1.26 billion U.S. dollar) and had hence already surpassed the total annual level of 2017.
Cause_General	Liebing pointed to the opening of a Volkswagen plant in the Rwandan capital of Kigali, as well as an ongoing cooperation between German Gauff Engineering and a Chinese partner to build Africa's longest suspension bridge in Mozambique.
Cause_General	While Germany is still a relatively small player in Africa, China has emerged as one of the continent's largest trading and investment partners.
Distant_Evaluation	Liebing argued that German companies should seize opportunities to cooperate with their Chinese counterparts rather than seeing them as rivals.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Liebing said that expanding African infrastructure provision was the key to raising productivity and promoting sustainable growth and better international cooperation.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Package solutions"" offered by China in this context offered Germans an exemplary model of how to boost economic growth in Africa, he said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""We should stop viewing China exclusively as a competitor."
Distant_Evaluation	"First successful examples show how Chinese and German firms can achieve mutually-beneficial outcomes in Africa,"" Liebing told press."
Distant_Evaluation	"""The only truly-sustainable form of developmental aid is to create local jobs"", he added."
Distant_Historical	The German-African Business Association was founded in 1934 to support firms from Germany in their commercial involvement in African countries.
Cause_General	Germany's exports to Africa currently account for around two percent of its total volume of international trade.

Main	WELLINGTON, Feb. 14 (Xinhua) -- Two-tiered real estate market continues in New Zealand as five regions see record prices, but Auckland and Canterbury, the two densely populated areas, see price falls, according to the latest data released from the Real Estate Institute of New Zealand (REINZ) on Thursday.
Main	January has pointed to a two-tiered real estate market continuing with 14 out of 16 regions experiencing annual increases in the median price for residential properties, while Auckland and Canterbury saw prices fall, REINZ statistics showed.
Cause_General	The national median price for residential properties increased by 5.8 percent year on year to 550,000 NZ dollars (373,835 U.S. dollars) in January 2019.
Cause_General	Prices for New Zealand excluding Auckland, the country's largest city, increased by 10.1 percent to 473,300 NZ dollars, REINZ said.
Main	In Auckland, prices fell 2.4 percent to 800,000 NZ dollars, the lowest median price for the region since February 2016.
Main	Canterbury saw a 0.7-percent annual decline in median house prices to 431,900 NZ dollars, it said.
Cause_General	The rest of the country has seen strong price growth, including five regions achieving record median prices, said Bindi Norwell, chief executive at REINZ, adding this increase in price once again highlights how the lack of supply is continuing to push up house prices.
Cause_General	New Zealand's third warmest January on record saw Kiwis heading to the beaches rather than to open homes -- houses open to potential buyers, meaning that the number of residential properties sold during January fell by 2.5 percent year-on-year, according to REINZ.

Cause_Specific	According to the DFL 2019 Economic Report, 17 of the 18 top flight clubs generated revenue of more than 100 million euros for a 13 per cent rise compared with the 2016-2017 season.
Main	Overall, revenue of the 36 Bundesliga and second-division clubs rose for a 14th straight year to 4.42 billion euros, an annual growth rate of 8.6 per cent.

Main	JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Aspen Pharmacare has agreed to sell its infant formula business to Lactalis for 12.9 billion rand ($865 million) to focus on core activities while the French buyer looks to revive its baby milk expansion after a health scandal.
Distant_Evaluation	Investors in the South African drugmaker appeared unimpressed, however, after expectations that the deal could top $1 billion.
Cause_General	The company’s share price tumbled after the deal’s announcement on Thursday alongside full-year earnings, dropping 26 percent before paring losses to stand 16.3 percent down at 228.06 rand by 1430 GMT.
Distant_Evaluation	Rising incomes in emerging markets coupled with global population growth have made infant formula an attractive proposition in a market dominated by Nestle, Danone and Reckitt Benckiser, which acquired Mead Johnson of the United States last year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The market expected Aspen to get $1 billion to $1.5 billion dollars,” Cratos Capital equity trader Greg Davies said, adding that there is also some doubt over Aspen’s stated growth expectations.
Distant_Evaluation	FNB Wealth and Investments portfolio manager Wayne McCurrie said a “second disappointment” concerned Aspen’s rising debt levels and whether Africa’s biggest manufacturer of generic drugs had been forced to sell the infant milk business to reduce gearing levels.
Distant_Evaluation	“The market is worried that they took a decision just on debt and not on the growth prospects of the business, because this business looked quite good,” McCurrie said.
Distant_Evaluation	“They were pumping it massively over the last year or so and all of a sudden say they are selling it.”
Distant_Evaluation	Aspen CEO Stephen Saad said the disposal was in line with “our strategic intention to focus attention on our core pharmaceutical business, which includes the anesthetics, thrombosis and high potency and cytotoxic portfolios”.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	After 1.1 billion rand to be paid to partners in Asia-Pacific, Aspen will receive 11.8 billion rand, representing 23 times the unit’s earnings of 512 million rand, Deputy Chief Executive Gus Attridge said.
Cause_General	CHANCE TO REBUILD
Cause_General	For Lactalis, meanwhile, the deal represents an opportunity to rebuild its baby milk business after a salmonella outbreak at its production site in northwest France caused dozens of babies to fall sick and led to a global product recall.
Cause_General	Lactalis is the world’s largest dairy firm, with annual sales of 18.4 billion euros ($21.4 billion), but baby milk has been a relatively small part of its activities and is now at a standstill after the health scare.
Distant_Evaluation	The company’s head of communications, Michel Nalet, said the production halt in France was “one of the factors” behind the move for the Aspen business
Distant_Evaluation	“In infant formula, we didn’t have a base outside France.
Distant_Evaluation	We had the desire to be a global player in all dairy businesses,” he said.
Cause_General	Aspen’s nutritionals business sells infant milk formula in the Asia-Pacific region, sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, and has been building a growing presence in the Middle East and China.
Cause_General	Privately owned Lactalis, which said the crisis could cost it hundreds of million of euros, decided the production line linked to the contamination should be closed permanently and is now awaiting permission from French authorities to restart output at its other production line.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The acquisition will be funded with cash, Aspen said, adding that the proceeds will reduce its debt and that the deal is expected to close in the next six months.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lactalis will also receive any intellectual property and goodwill presently owned by Aspen Holdings and Pharmacare Ltd and Aspen Global Incorporated.
Cause_General	Aspen’s infant formula business contributed 3.1 billion rand to group revenue in the year to June 30.
Cause_General	The drugmaker posted full-year normalized earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 12 billion rand, up 5 percent, helped by strong growth in China, inclusion of anesthetics portfolios acquired the previous year and positive organic growth in commercial pharmaceuticals.
Cause_General	Aspen declared a dividend of 315 cents per share, up 10 percent.

Cause_General	The Yemeni government insists on retaking Hodeidah province where its forces, with support from a Saudi-led coalition, have been engaged in battles with the Houthis for months.
Cause_General	Moreover, it insists on implementing the UN Security Council's resolution 2216 which calls for Houthis' withdrawal from cities and handover of heavy weapons.
Distant_Evaluation	Griffiths said at a news conference at the opening of the consultations that the talks are being focused on Hodeidah, reopening airports, the economy, the worst humanitarian crisis in the world and releasing all prisoners.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Shortly before heading for Sweden, the government and the Houthis started arrangements for the release of all prisoners and detainees and all they need to agree on during the consultations is suitable mechanism to make that a reality.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""These political consultations in Sweden are the first step toward putting Yemen on the path to peace,"" Griffiths said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""I hope that by the end of this round, the Yemeni parties will agree on the outline of an eventual comprehensive agreement, which will then be submitted to the United Nations secretary general and then to the Security Council for endorsement,"" he added."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Any peace agreement should be based on the UN resolutions, the Gulf Initiative, and the outcomes of the national dialog conference which was attended by all Yemeni factions during 2013, he pointed out.
Cause_General	The Yemeni warring parties have held several rounds of peace talks since the conflict began after Houthis seized power in late 2014.
Cause_General	However, all talks collapsed, leading to more violence on the ground.
Distant_Evaluation	Observers argued that the Houthis will not accept to give up their arms and preconditions indicate all parties still don't have goodwill to reach a peace deal.
Distant_Anecdotal	"Abbas Al-Dhaleai, a political commentator, said ""the political process after what Saudi Arabia has done and spent in Yemen means a defeat to Saudi Arabia."
Distant_Anecdotal	The Gulf kingdom will not accept defeat.
Distant_Anecdotal	"It wants to disarm the Houthis, a thing that can't be achieved in reality."""
Distant_Anecdotal	"""The Houthis have been taking advantage of the Saudi-led coalition's confusion and political and military failures."
Distant_Anecdotal	But the most important thing is that they are not statesmen, but militants.
Distant_Anecdotal	"They can't imagine themselves living without arms,"" Al-Dhaleai added."
Distant_Evaluation	Adil Al-Shuja'a, a politics professor from Sanaa university, said foreign actors don't want to end the conflict in Yemen because they want to sell more arms.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, has been saying that the U.S. will continue to back the Saudi-led coalition, ignoring the high humanitarian cost of this war,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Big powers such as the U.S., the UK and France have convinced the world that they are arms dealers, not peace makers,"" the professor added."
Cause_General	Peace talks between the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels, coordinated by the UN, started on Thursday at Johannesberg Castle, about 60 kilometers north of Stockholm, Sweden.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The talks are expected to last for one week, depending on the consultations' progress, according to Hanan Eldawadi, chief public information officer at the office of the Special Envoy of the UN Secretary-General for Yemen (OSESGY).
Cause_General	The Yemeni government delegation landed at Stockholm Arlanda Airport Wednesday afternoon, while the delegation of the Houthi rebels, together with Griffiths, arrived in Sweden on Tuesday evening.

Main	BERLIN, Sept. 19 (Xinhua) -- German intelligence chief Hans-Georg Maasen will be promoted to a more senior post in the interior ministry, the country's federal government announced on Tuesday night.
Cause_Specific	The decision to relieve Maasen of his duties as president of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) and instead offer him the better salaried position as secretary of state for interior- and cyber security was reached during an emergency cabinet session.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Earlier, the German Social Democrats (SPD) had threatened to quit the ""grand coalition"", formed together with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), unless Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) personally ensured that Maasen was sacked by Wednesday."
Cause_General	The previously-little known national intelligence services executive, the former BfV president, has recently sparked heated public debate in Germany by questioning the authenticity of a video footage in which right-wing extremists were seen chasing and accosting stereotypically foreign-looking civilians on the streets of Chemnitz.
Cause_General	In doing so, Maasen directly contradicted chancellor Merkel and local security officers on the issue before backtracking on the statement in question during a subsequent report.
Distant_Evaluation	As a consequence, senior SPD politicians complained that the uncertainty created by Maasen and the resulting impetus provided to online conspiracy theories, as well as a growing impression that the BfV president has personal sympathies for the far-right, rendered him unsuitable for the task of protecting the German constitution.
Cause_General	Maasen has previously already been accused of offering clandestine advice to the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on how to prevent its monitoring by the BfV, a claim he vigorously denies.
Distant_Evaluation	Nevertheless, interior minister and CSU leader Horst Seehofer, whose ministry is responsible for nominating the leadership of the BfV, insisted that his trust in Maasen remained intact.
Main_Consequence	In his new role, Maasen will once again report to Seehofer while receiving a monthly salary of 14,100 euros (16,500 U.S. dollars) compared to 11,500 euros at the BfV.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The interior minister is scheduled to provide detailed information about the responsibilities of Maasen as secretary of state on Wednesday.
Distant_Evaluation	"CDU leader Merkel, CSU leader Seehofer and SPD leader Andrea Nahles described Maasen's promotion as a sensible compromise which would ensure the continued existence of the ""grand coalition"" and thus enable the federal government to return to its regular work."
Distant_Evaluation	However, the unusual personnel decision in response to widespread allegations of inappropriate behavior was met with a wave of criticism in the German media, the ruling parties themselves and the opposition.
Distant_Evaluation	"The magazine ""SPIEGEL"" wrote that the final outcome and way in which a decision was reached in the affair offered an ""exemplary case of how to promote frustration with politics."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"SPD vice-president Ralf Stegner similarly told the German press agency (dpa) on Wednesday that the development was a ""disaster"" which would cause support in his party for a continuation of the ""grand coalition"" to fall even further to dangerously low levels."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	For Kevin Kuehnert, the leader of the SPD youth organization (Juso) and one of the most outspoken critics of Merkel, Seehofer and Maasen, the time has come for the party to exit Merkel's fourth ruling cabinet.
Distant_Evaluation	"Kuehnert argued in the newspaper ""Rheinische Post"" that the ""price for the continued existence of the coalition is too high."""
Distant_Evaluation	"He lamented that Maasen's promotion was a ""slap in the face"" for everybody who had to shoulder the full responsibility for themselves and their behavior at work every day."
Distant_Evaluation	"The Greens (Gruene) and Left party (Linke) both attacked the move as a being a ""farcical"" solution in separate statements."
Distant_Evaluation	Free Democratic Party (FDP) vice president Stephan Thomae interpreted the surprising success of Maasen in securing a new government post under Seehofer as a sign of Merkel's rapidly eroding authority in her won cabinet.

Distant_Evaluation	WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on Friday signaled patience in the central bank's policy contemplation for this year despite a higher-than-expected job growth data released on the same day.
Distant_Evaluation	"At a panel discussion in Atlanta with former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke, Powell said economic data suggest ""ongoing momentum heading into 2019,"" adding that Fed officials will be ""patient"" as they ""watch to see how the economy evolves."""
Main	The central bank chief's remarks came on the heels of a report released Friday by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showing U.S. nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 312,000 in December, well above the average monthly job gains of 254,000 for the last three months and the strongest average employment increase in more than two years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That robust figure, however, will not as of now change the Fed's plan to conduct two rate hikes this year, as the central bank awaits more economic indicators coming in the next few months.
Main	The December job report also indicated that unemployment rate was up 0.2 percentage point month-on-month to 3.9 percent, and that average hourly earnings for all employees on private nonfarm payrolls rose 11 cents, or 0.4 percent over November, to 27.48 U.S. dollars.
Distant_Evaluation	"""That's quite welcome,"" Powell said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""And also, for me at this time, it does not raise concerns about too-high inflation."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Currently, the U.S. inflation rate remains below what the Fed considers an optimal 2 percent level, meaning there is still space for economic expansion and workers are just beginning to benefit from the growth.
Distant_Evaluation	"The Fed raised its benchmark interest rate four times in 2018, with the latest announced on Dec. 19, when Powell said his institution's policy decisions are ""not on a preset course."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Echoing that assertion, the central banker said at the Atlanta event that the Fed was ready to change course ""significantly if necessary."""
Distant_Evaluation	Powell denied the criticism that the Fed's gradual reduction of its holdings of Treasuries, mortgage bonds and other assets - amounting to 4.5 trillion dollars when the Fed began its balance sheet normalization program in Oct. 2017 - had exacerbated the stock market turbulence in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We don't believe our issuance is an important part of the story,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	At the same time, he reassured investors of the Fed's flexibility.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""If we ever came to the conclusion that any aspect of our plans"" was part of a problem, ""we wouldn't hesitate to change it."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Analysts predicted that job reports for January and February will be more of a policy reference for the Fed than the December report as they would provide a clearer picture of how tightened financial conditions affect the U.S. economy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The central bank will convene its first policy meeting this year on Jan. 29 and 30, followed by a second at the end of March.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	BEIRUT (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday that Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, who Lebanon’s president says is being held hostage by Saudi Arabia, will visit France with his family in coming days.
Error	Lebanese President Michel Aoun meets with Lebanese journalists and media executives at the presidential palace in Baabda, Lebanon, November 15, 2017.

Cause_Specific	Hariri travelled to Riyadh on Nov. 3 before abruptly resigning in a televised statement a day later.
Distant_Evaluation	He has stayed in Riyadh and top Lebanese officials and senior politicians close to Hariri have told Reuters he was forced to quit.
Distant_Evaluation	Hariri and Saudi Arabia have both denied he is being held in Riyadh or was coerced to resign.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Hariri has said he will return to Lebanon in the next few days to formally submit his resignation.
Distant_Evaluation	The crisis has thrust Lebanon onto the frontline of a Middle East contest for power pitting a Saudi-led bloc against Iran and its allies, including the Lebanese Shi’ite group Hezbollah.
Cause_General	French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement that he had invited Hariri to France after speaking to him and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Distant_Evaluation	The invitation is to visit for a few days and is not an offer of political exile, Macron said, speaking in Germany.
Main	“We will not accept (Hariri) remaining a hostage whose reason for detention we do not know,” Lebanese President Michel Aoun said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil, the head of Aoun’s political party, said the situation was “not normal” but that Beirut wanted “good relations” with Riyadh.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Aoun has said he will not accept Hariri’s resignation until he returns to Lebanon to formally tender it and explain his reasons, which Hariri has said he will do in the coming days.
Distant_Evaluation	Saudi Arabia has long been considered Hariri’s main external supporter.
Cause_General	Aoun is a political ally of Lebanon’s Hezbollah, a powerful Shi’ite Muslim group with close ties to Iran.
Distant_Historical	Lebanon’s coalition government was formed last year through a political deal that made Aoun president, Hariri prime minister, and included members of Hezbollah in the cabinet.
Cause_General	Saudi Arabia last week accused Lebanon of having declared war on it because of Hezbollah’s role in other Arab countries.
Cause_General	It regards Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.
Cause_General	Riyadh’s main ally, the United States, has struck a different tone, continuing its support for Lebanon including military aid.
Cause_General	The European Union has also repeatedly stated its support for Lebanon, which hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In an interview on Sunday night with a television station he owns, Hariri warned of economic sanctions against Lebanon and of a threat to the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of Lebanese workers living in Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies.
Cause_Specific	“Nothing justifies Hariri’s lack of return for 12 days.
Main	We therefore consider him detained,” Aoun said.
Distant_Evaluation	He added that Lebanon had confirmed that Hariri’s family were under detention in their house in Saudi Arabia and were searched whenever they entered or left it.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Speaking in Italy, Foreign Minister Bassil said: “We will continue all steps...for this problem to be solved in a brotherly way through good relations that we want to have with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He added, however: “If Saudi Arabia has a problem with Iran or with Hezbollah, they have to solve it with Iran, not with Lebanon and not with all the Lebanese.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“PERFECTLY FINE”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Hariri wrote on Twitter that he was “perfectly fine” and would return, “God willing, to dear Lebanon as I promised”.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On Wednesday he said he would return in a couple of days but that his family was staying in Saudi Arabia, calling it “their country”.
Cause_General	Hariri holds Saudi nationality and his family fortune is based on the construction company - Saudi Oger - built by his father Rafik al-Hariri, who served twice as Lebanese prime minister and was assassinated in 2005.
Distant_Evaluation	Okab Sakr, a member of parliament for Hariri’s Future Movement, told Reuters he had spoken on Wednesday to Hariri and that he told him neither he nor his family were being held.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On Tuesday, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said after meeting Bassil in Paris that she expected Hariri and his family to return to Lebanon soon.
Distant_Evaluation	Sources from across Lebanon’s political spectrum have said Hariri struck a more compromising tone in his Sunday interview than in his resignation statement, when he bitterly attacked Iran and Hezbollah.
Error	Slideshow (4 Images)
Distant_Evaluation	The sources said this represented a retreat by Riyadh attributable to Western pressure.
Distant_Evaluation	On Wednesday, Aoun said Riyadh had not responded to Arab countries who tried to secure Hariri’s return so he had asked the international community to help.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian arrives in Riyadh late on Wednesday and is due to discuss Lebanon with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and meet Hariri on Thursday, a French diplomatic source said.
Cause_General	France has close relations with Lebanon, which was under French control between the world wars, and with Hariri, who has a home in France and spent several years in the country.

Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. senator said on Thursday she will ask Facebook Inc (FB.O) and the Justice Department about a media report that the company hired an outside firm to attack critics, warning that such action could raise campaign finance issues.
Main	Senator Amy Klobuchar told the Senate Judiciary Committee she would send a letter seeking details about a New York Times article that named the Minnesota Democrat as a target of an aggressive Facebook lobbying campaign that relied partly on a Republican opposition research firm.
Cause_General	Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Klobuchar.
Cause_General	But Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg told reporters that he ended the company’s relationship with the outside firm, Definers Public Affairs, after he became aware of it while reading the New York Times story.
Cause_General	Definers did not respond to a request to comment.
Cause_Specific	The New York Times said Facebook conducted an aggressive campaign to combat critics, shift public anger toward rival companies and fend off new regulations contained in proposed legislation that Klobuchar supports.
Distant_Evaluation	“This is a pretty serious matter for those of us on the receiving line,” Klobuchar told the committee.
Distant_Evaluation	“I would like to know what was going on with elected officials,” she said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If they in fact were taking actions against critics, this could be a campaign finance issue...
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It could also have other legal ramifications.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If Facebook spent money trying to influence the outcome of an election, it would have been required to disclose that spending to the Federal Election Commission and failure to do so would be a violation of the law.
Cause_General	However, recent Supreme Court rulings have given companies leeway, requiring that they directly call for someone to be elected, or lose their office, to trigger the campaign finance laws.
Cause_Specific	The Times report said Facebook hired the Republican firm to discredit activist protesters and lobbied a Jewish civil rights group to cast some critics of the company as anti-Semitic.
Cause_Specific	Its issue with Klobuchar involved legislation known as the Honest Ads Act, which she has supported along with Democratic Senator Mark Warner and the late Arizona Republican Senator John McCain.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The bill would compel Facebook and other internet firms to disclose the sponsors of political ads on their websites.

Main	WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S.
Main	Senator Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, said Friday that he will not seek re-election in 2020.
Cause_General	Roberts, 82, has served in the U.S. Senate since 1997.
Distant_Historical	He last won reelection in 2014.
Distant_Evaluation	"""I will serve the remainder of this term as your senator, fighting for Kansas in these troubled times,"" Roberts announced in Topeka, state of Kansas."
Main	"""However, I will not be a candidate in 2020 for a fifth Senate term."""
Cause_General	Roberts, the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, has helped craft eight farm bills during his tenure.
Distant_Historical	He had also served in the House for 16 years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	His retirement is set to spark interest in his seat from other Kansas Republicans, signaling a potentially crowed 2020 primary.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Republicans expect the seat to remain safely in their control as Kansas has not sent a Democrat to the Senate since the 1930s.
Cause_General	Roberts is the second Republican senator to announce not to seek re-election in 2020, following Tennessee's Lamar Alexander.
Main	The White House is planning an aggressive effort to sell Congress and the American public on President Bush's new strategy for Iraq, beginning with a prime-time address to the nation on Wednesday night, followed Thursday by a presidential trip to Fort Benning, Ga., and appearances on Capitol Hill by the secretaries of state and defense.
Cause_General	With Democrats vowing to oppose any plan to send more troops to Iraq, and some Republicans openly skeptical, Mr. Bush and his aides are already in the thick of an intense sales pitch.
Main	It began on Monday, when the president had back-to-back meetings with Republican senators, urging them to hear him out before passing judgment on his plan.
Distant_Evaluation	The sessions stood in stark contrast to the bipartisan meetings Mr. Bush held with lawmakers on Friday.
Distant_Evaluation	Senators attending those sessions said that Mr. Bush was careful not to reveal his thinking about whether he was committed to the plan to increase troops.
Distant_Evaluation	By Monday, though, he made his intentions clear.
Distant_Evaluation	''It was clear that he has thought long and hard about this change in strategy,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who supports the troop increase.
Distant_Evaluation	''He emphasized that this is not just about more troops.
Distant_Evaluation	That's just one small component of it.
Distant_Evaluation	It's a change in economic, military and political strategy.''
Main	White House officials were still planning details of the speech on Monday.
Cause_General	The president's aides were contemplating having Mr. Bush deliver it from the White House Map Room, a site replete with the history and imagery of World War II -- imagery that Mr. Bush has invoked as he has sought to compare the campaign against terrorism to the struggle against totalitarianism and the Nazis.
Cause_General	But the Oval Office, a more traditional setting, was also being considered.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Bush's aides are planning a highly orchestrated introduction of the plan.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Before Wednesday night's speech, which is expected to last about 25 minutes, reporters will receive briefings from senior administration officials, and leading members of Congress will be notified of the president's intentions.
Main	On Thursday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates are scheduled to testify before Congress, and both are expected to make trips to the Middle East soon to drum up support from international allies.
Distant_Evaluation	''All the world is really watching,'' the White House press secretary, Tony Snow, said Monday, ''and it is important to get this right.''
Main	The president himself will go on the road on Thursday, to Fort Benning, a site chosen because its soldiers are heavily involved in operations in Iraq.
Main	A senior administration official involved in shaping the strategy said the president would follow Wednesday night's speech with less formal remarks to the troops.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''He will thank them, and explain, just like he will have the night before to the American people, some of the specifics of the new way forward,'' the official said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The official said the strategy also included continuing consultation with members of Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's not just one speech,'' the official said.
Distant_Evaluation	''This is so complicated you couldn't do it all in one speech.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	So there will be an ongoing and sustained effort to educate the American people.''
Distant_Evaluation	Despite Mr. Bush's insistence that he does not govern by polls, the White House is acutely aware that a vast majority of the American public disapproves of the job Mr. Bush is doing in Iraq.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But advisers to the president believe that the public is willing to give Mr. Bush another chance -- especially if he puts forth a policy that is heavy on specifics.
Distant_Evaluation	The president's advisers are also mindful of polls showing that while the public wants the situation to improve in Iraq, it does not necessarily favor immediate withdrawal.
Distant_Evaluation	''They're going to cast it as a choice between withdrawal and surge,'' said one Republican strategist close to the White House.
Distant_Evaluation	''The public is not for immediate withdrawal or even a quick withdrawal, but they're not for the status quo.
Distant_Evaluation	I think they feel as if the public is more likely to support the president's position, which is putting a stake in the ground in Iraq and saying were going to try to win.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The hope is that Mr. Bush can win over the public, and bring Congress along.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But it might be a tough sell.
Cause_General	At the White House, Mr. Bush told skeptical senators that he came away from a recent meeting in Jordan with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq persuaded that Mr. Maliki was committed to moving toward national reconciliation.
Distant_Evaluation	At least two Republicans, Senators Gordon Smith of Oregon and Olympia Snowe of Maine, said they were not convinced.
Distant_Evaluation	''I expressed reservations,'' Ms. Snowe said.
Distant_Evaluation	''I said, 'Why should we expect any different result than previously,' that I didn't believe the Maliki government had demonstrated the political will or capacity or resoluteness for reconciliation, that the reason Americans are not supporting the war is because they see Iraqis fighting among themselves rather than for themselves, and I didn't see the surge addressing the root causes of the violence.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Smith, who delivered a speech on the Senate floor before Christmas saying he was at the end of his rope on Iraq, said: ''What this sets up is a classic war powers confrontation between the White House and the Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	Clearly he has the powers to commit troops; the question is whether the Congress has the convictions to deny funding.''
Distant_Evaluation	The senator said he, for one, does not have the appetite for that.
Distant_Evaluation	''It would be a dishonorable thing,'' he said, ''to budget away the bullets.''

Main	WASHINGTON, Oct. 6 (Xinhua) -- Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's second Supreme Court nominee, was sworn in on Saturday evening, shortly after the Senate passed his contentious confirmation by a vote of 50-48 amid fierce partisan fights focusing on sexual misconduct allegations against him.
Cause_General	COURT MOVES RIGHTWARD
Distant_Evaluation	Hailed as a big political victory for Trump and the Republican Party, Kavanaugh's lifetime appointment as the 114th Supreme Court justice appeared to secure a solid majority of conservatives on the U.S. highest court for years.
Cause_Specific	Nominating Kavanaugh was the second time in two years that Trump has made a Supreme Court pick.
Cause_General	The 53-year-old succeeded 82-year-old Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired on July 31 after having served as a pivotal swing vote between conservatives and liberals on the nine-member bench for years.
Main_Consequence	As a result, the court now consists of five conservatives and four liberals.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There will be no swing vote if none of the conservative justices move to the middle.
Distant_Evaluation	"The court ""will perfectly reflect the deep polarization of the American public and political system,"" Adam Liptak with the New York Times commented."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The rightward trend of the U.S. highest court is expected to have long-term substantial effects on many issues deeply dividing Americans, such as abortion, affirmative action, voting and gun rights.
Cause_General	The Supreme Court decides matters that shape the U.S. politics.
Cause_General	It is both the highest appeals panel and a constitutional court in the country.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	PARTISAN FIGHT
Cause_Specific	Kavanaugh was confirmed by a margin of 50 votes to 48 in the Senate final floor vote, the slimmest for a Supreme Court nominee in more than a century.
Cause_General	Senator Joe Manchin, who was facing tough re-election campaign in red state West Virginia, was the only Democrat to vote for Kavanaugh's confirmation.
Distant_Evaluation	Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Saturday that the bitter partisan battle over Kavanaugh's confirmation has revved up Republican voters across red states.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Our base is on fire,"" the top Senate Republican said in an interview with The Hill news daily."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, Democrats also say their voters are now more fired up than ever to deliver a rebuke to the Republicans in the midterm elections, citing women's anger as a force.
Cause_General	"During the Senate final voting on Saturday, hundreds of protesters were demonstrating on Capitol Hill, chanting ""November is coming"" and ""We believe survivors."""
Cause_General	Capitol Police said later in the day that 164 of them were arrested.
Cause_General	Amid partisan fights over the confirmation, three women came forward last month to accuse Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting or harassing them during his high school and university years.
Cause_General	Kavanaugh has denied all the accusations.
Distant_Evaluation	The results on the upcoming midterm elections seem to be complicated.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, it appears the two mainstream parties in the country would continue fighting each other in a likely more polarized way, analysts say.

Main	MOSCOW, Sept. 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin will discuss Syrian issues with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Russia's Sochi on Monday, the Kremlin said in a statement Sunday.
Cause_General	The meeting will take place at a time when the Syrian government forces backed by Russia and Iran are preparing an offensive against rebels' last major stronghold in Idlib province, although Turkey and the United States have repeatedly warned against any operation.
Cause_General	Erdogan's call for a cease-fire in Idlib, which borders Turkey, was accepted neither by Russia nor Iran at the tripartite summit in Tehran on Sept. 7.
Cause_General	Last week, four Russian warplanes stationed in Syria's Hmeymim airbase attacked militants in Idlib and the Russian Foreign Ministry said it was important and urgent to eradicate terrorism in Idlib.
Cause_General	Russian strategic bombers have simulated striking targets in Syria.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Turkey and the United States reject the possible offensive in Idlib, citing that it could cause great civilian casualties and even a humanitarian disaster.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are expected to negotiate over Idlib on the sidelines of the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly that will open on Tuesday.

Cause_Specific	The 82-22 vote in favor of Vizcarra’s six-month-old government commits lawmakers to passing his judicial and political reforms by Oct. 4, a rare victory over the conservative opposition party, Popular Force, that controls Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	Earlier on Wednesday, Popular Force leader Keiko Fujimori, a twice-defeated presidential candidate and the daughter of former autocrat Alberto Fujimori, accused Vizcarra of trying to stage a legislative coup d’etat.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Under Peru’s constitution, a vote of no-confidence would have forced Vizcarra to replace his entire cabinet.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But since Congress has already dismissed one cabinet, he would also have been able to call new legislative elections in response.
Cause_General	Vizcarra called for unity after the vote.
Distant_Evaluation	“There are not winners or losers here,” Vizcarra said on Twitter.
Distant_Evaluation	“Only Peru wins.”
Cause_General	Vizcarra had called for a vote of confidence late on Sunday to force passage of legislation aimed at curbing entrenched graft and rebuilding trust in public institutions following back-to-back scandals in the past year-and-a-half.
Cause_General	Critics of Popular Force had pressured Vizcarra to take a more confrontational stance toward the opposition party after it helped to topple his predecessor, former president Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.
Distant_Historical	Kuczynski resigned due to graft allegations on the eve of a second impeachment vote backed by Popular Force in March.
Distant_Historical	Vizcarra, his vice president, took office to replace him with promises to fight graft “at any cost.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	I have “total confidence in receiving the vote of confidence today,” Vizcarra told journalists surrounded by his cabinet before the vote.
Distant_Evaluation	“The four bills must be approved.”
Cause_General	Vizcarra’s proposals, which require modifying the constitution, include a new system for selecting judges, a return to a bi-cameral Congress, stricter campaign financing rules and a ban on the re-election of lawmakers.
Cause_General	He pitched the proposals in July after an influence-peddling scandal in the judiciary triggered street protests and anger at the political class.
Distant_Evaluation	Popular Force has denied trying to stall the legislation, arguing that parts of it were not as urgent as other matters, such as rebuilding areas affected by severe flooding last year.
Distant_Evaluation	Fujimori told a crowd of supporters on Wednesday that Vizcarra called for the confidence vote to cover up potentially damaging revelations from ongoing graft probes.
Distant_Evaluation	“What this kind of threat shows is nervousness,” Fujimori said in a video of her speech to supporters posted on Facebook.
Distant_Evaluation	“No matter what they try to do...all Peruvians must know the truth,” she said.

Cause_General	Benjamin Harnwell, director of the Dignitatis Humanae Institute based in a mountaintop monastery not far from Rome, told Reuters Bannon had been helping to build up the institute for about half of its eight-year life.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Cardinal Raymond Burke, a leading Vatican conservative who is president of the Institute’s board of advisers, said Bannon would be playing a leading role there.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Burke told Reuters he looked forward to working with Harnwell and Bannon “to promote a number of projects that should make a decisive contribution to the defense of what used to be called Christendom”.
Distant_Evaluation	Bannon’s increased engagement with the Institute demonstrates how his involvement in Europe extends beyond electoral politics to an effort to build a populist faction inside the Catholic Church.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Bannon told Reuters this week that after Nov. 6 Congressional elections in the United States, he will spend “80-90 percent” of his time in Europe building up his Brussels-based populist “Movement”.
Main	Bannon, who has visited the Institute’s home at the 800-year-old Monastery of Trisulti and addressed the organization by video link, is helping to draw up the coursework for a training program for conservative Catholic political activists and leaders, Harnwell said.
Cause_General	Bannon is also raising funds for the institute in both Europe and the United States, he added.
Distant_Evaluation	The institute has set “very high academic standards”, Harnwell said.
Cause_General	Harnwell, a former European Parliament staffer, also is advising Bannon on his campaign to build a populist Movement across Europe that will support far-right parties in next year’s European Parliament elections, he and Bannon said.
Cause_General	Bannon and the Vatican did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this story.
Cause_General	EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
Cause_General	Harnwell said he founded the institute while working as an aide to a British Conservative European Parliament member.
Cause_General	At the time, one of the legislature’s committees was trying to block Rocco Buttiglione, a confidant of Pope John Paul II, from becoming European Commissioner for justice and security.
Distant_Evaluation	During a confirmation hearing, Buttiglione, who was nominated to the European Commission by then-Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, described homosexuality as a sin and said the principal role of women was to have children.
Cause_General	Amid political uproar, Buttiglione withdrew from consideration for the Commission.
Distant_Evaluation	Harnwell said Buttiglione was a “founding patron” of the Dignitatis Humanae Institute, whose mission he described as “defending the Judeo-Christian tradition” and promoting “human dignity based on the image of God”.
Distant_Evaluation	Harnwell added: “If you don’t have a culture of religious principle, we no longer have a credible basis for life.”
Distant_Evaluation	Buttiglione, who described himself as a convinced pro-European, said there were some differences between him and Harnwell.
Distant_Evaluation	“I am interested in a cultural dialogue with the so-called Populists but I am not one of them and, first and foremost, I am a Catholic and I stand by the pope,” he said in statement to Reuters.
Cause_General	Harnwell said the Institute was setting up two training programs: a leadership course that Bannon is helping to design, which Harnwell described a an “academy for the Judeo-Christian West”, and the Cardinal Martino Academy, named after a former papal ambassador to the United Nations, which will promote pro-life Catholic social teachings.
Distant_Historical	RABBLE-ROUSING
Distant_Historical	Bannon, a rabble-rousing conservative media entrepreneur and activist popular with Trump’s base, was fired from the White House a year ago, but the former adviser remained a Trump ally.
Cause_General	Bannon returned to the right-wing Breitbart News website, which he had headed before running Trump’s presidential campaign.
Distant_Historical	In January, Bannon quit as Breitbart’s executive chairman after angering Trump by harshly criticizing his eldest son.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Leaving Breitbart threatened Bannon’s dream of leading a new political movement that supports his “America First” agenda of tougher trade deals and immigration laws.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Harnwell said the Institute expects to present its first courses next year.
Cause_General	The monastery is large enough to accommodate 250-300 students at a time.
Cause_General	Burke, the former Archbishop of St. Louis, has been a leading light at the Institute since 2013 and is an outspoken critic of some policies of Pope Francis.
Cause_General	Since Francis’ election in 2013, Burke has led the charge by conservatives who have sharply criticized the pope, saying he has left many faithful confused by pronouncements that the church should be more welcoming to homosexuals and divorced Catholics and not be obsessed by “culture war” issues such as abortion.
Cause_General	Burke is president of the Institute’s “advisory board”, Harnwell said.
Distant_Evaluation	The cardinal has condemned Islam as a threat to the West, a position that strongly parallels one of the principal political campaign themes of both Bannon and Trump.
Distant_Historical	In 2014, Pope Francis removed Burke as chief of the Vatican’s Supreme Court, the Apostolic Signatura, and demoted him to become patron of the Order of Malta, a charitable organization.

Distant_Evaluation	Bannon is in “communication” regularly with Burke, although Harnwell acknowledges that the three-times divorced Bannon “doesn’t pretend to be a model Catholic”.
Distant_Evaluation	Harnwell said the institute itself “takes no view on the pope” or his policies.
Cause_General	Burke has met several times with Matteo Salvini, Italy’s far-right deputy prime minister, Harnwell said.
Cause_General	Earlier this summer, Salvini ordered Italian ports to stop allowing landings of ships carrying refugees fleeing Middle East strife.
Cause_General	After meeting Bannon in Rome last weekend, Salvini announced that he was joining the populist Movement Bannon was setting up aimed at disrupting the European Union.
Error	In this file photo taken on June 15, 2018 Paul Manafort arrives for a hearing at U.S. District Court on June 15, 2018 in Washington D.C., the United States, Manafort was found guilty on 8 charges of tax and bank fraud on Aug. 21, 2018.
Error	(AFP Photo)
Main	"WASHINGTON, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Paul Manafort, U.S. President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, will cooperate with Special Counsel Robert Mueller ""fully and truthfully"" as part of his guilty plea deal, a prosecutor said in Washington D.C. federal court on Friday."
Main	Speaking at the plea hearing in court, prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said that Manafort has agreed to cooperate with investigators, as part of the 17-page deal in which Manafort pleaded guilty to only two out of seven charges.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The deal will not release Manafort from prison, but calls for an up to ten-year cap on Manafort's jail time though it may not include any likely sentence for his conviction of eight counts last month in Virginia.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The deal will also dismiss deadlocked charges from last month's mistrial of other ten charges in Virginia federal court, the report added.
Distant_Evaluation	In court on Friday, U.S. District Court judge Amy Berman Jackson asked if the veteran Republican lobbyist understood what rights he's giving up.
Distant_Evaluation	"""I understand."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Manafort answered, ""I plead guilty."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""Has anybody forced you, coerced you or threatened you in any way?"""
Distant_Evaluation	she asked later.
Distant_Evaluation	"""No,"" Manafort replied."
Distant_Evaluation	"Manafort's lawyer Kevin Downing told reporters after the hearing that his client ""wanted to make sure his family remained safe and live a good life."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""He has accepted responsibility."""
Distant_Evaluation	Downing said of Manafort.
Cause_General	However, so far all the charges against Manafort are not related to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, as the White House immediately pointed out in a quick response.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This had absolutely nothing to do with the President or his victorious 2016 Presidential campaign,"" White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a brief statement."
Distant_Evaluation	"""It is totally unrelated."""
Distant_Evaluation	she said.
Cause_General	Trump has not yet tweeted any comments about Manafort's plea deal.
Cause_General	The several tweets he issued on Friday so far were focused on the rescue of Hurricane Florence which made landfall in the U.S. East Coast Friday morning, causing severe damage.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	According to documents filed in court prior to the hearing, Manafort intends to plead guilty to two charges of the seven he faced at his second trial: conspiring to defraud the United States and conspiring to obstruct justice.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Manafort cheated the United States out of over 15 million dollars in taxes,"" the document says, referring to the veteran Republican lobbyist's income in secret offshore accounts."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Also as part of the plea deal, the government plans to seize four properties, including a nearly 2-million-dollar house in Virginia owned by one of his daughters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The deal also calls for forfeiture of four financial accounts and a life insurance policy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Local analysts say Manafort's cooperation with Mueller could provide new clues or evidence over the ongoing probe into alleged Russia meddling into the 2016 U.S. elections.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, the guilty plea would allow him to avoid his second trial scheduled to begin later this month and last for weeks, which will save Trump from relative bad headlines before Nov. 6 midterm elections.
Cause_General	All the charges against Manafort largely stem from his time working for a pro-Russian leader in Ukraine years before the 2016 U.S. elections.
Cause_General	As a result, they do not directly address any alleged collusion between Trump associates or officials and the Russian government, which the Mueller team has been investigating since last year.
Distant_Evaluation	"Trump has repeatedly attacked the Mueller probe as a ""rigged witch hunt."""
Cause_General	Manafort, 69, was a veteran Republican lobbyist.
Distant_Historical	He joined Trump's campaign team in March 2016 and spent three months as Trump's campaign chairman until mid August of that year.
Main	A planned visit to Syria next week by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi drew criticism on Friday from the White House, which accused the Democratic Congressional leader of failing to heed the administration's admonitions against travel to Damascus.
Cause_Specific	Ms. Pelosi is leading a bipartisan delegation on a weeklong tour of the Middle East that is scheduled to include a meeting with Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad.
Cause_General	The Bush administration has resisted significant contact with the Syrian government, accusing it of meddling in Lebanon, supporting terrorism and being unhelpful on Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	''We don't think it's a good idea,'' said the White House deputy press secretary, Dana Perino, of the Congressional visit.
Distant_Evaluation	''We think that someone should take a step back and think about the message that it sends.''
Cause_Specific	As the House started a spring break on Friday, Ms. Pelosi and six members of Congress began a trip to Israel, Syria, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia.
Cause_General	While the United States government has engaged in tentative contact with Syrian officials recently, Ms. Pelosi is the highest-level American official to travel to Syria in years.
Distant_Evaluation	The White House said it had not been informed that the delegation would be stopping in Syria.
Distant_Evaluation	A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, Brendan Daly, denied that assertion on Friday.
Distant_Evaluation	He said the speaker recalled discussing her Syria trip directly with President Bush on Thursday during his brief visit to the Capitol.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Daly also dismissed suggestions that the State Department had warned the Congressional delegation not to visit Syria.
Distant_Evaluation	He said the speaker was following the Iraq Study Group's recommendations to ''discuss a wide range of security issues'' with Middle East governments, including Syria.
Cause_General	In an interview Friday, Mr. Daly said a separate group of Republicans, including Representatives Frank R. Wolf of Virginia, Joe Pitts of Pennsylvania and Robert B. Aderholt of Alabama, also was visiting Syria.
Cause_General	The United States, which believes that Iran and Syria are involved in fueling sectarian violence in Iraq, has declined to conduct direct talks with either government.
Cause_General	Earlier this month, an American official attended a conference in Baghdad with representatives of both governments, but there have been no high-level meetings among leaders.
Distant_Evaluation	''In our view, it is not the right time to have these sorts of high-profile visits to Syria,'' Sean McCormack, a spokesman for the State Department, said.
Cause_General	During the Israel portion of the trip, Ms. Pelosi is scheduled to address the Knesset.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	She is the highest-ranking American woman to speak before the country's Parliament, her spokesman said, and she plans to detail ''America's commitment to Israel and the challenges facing the two nations in the Middle East.''
Error	THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ
Main	BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovakia demanded on Thursday that Vietnam explain media reports that Vietnamese agents used a Slovak government plane to smuggle home an ex-oil executive they kidnapped from Berlin last year.
Cause_Specific	The German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reported last week that Vietnam may have used a Slovak plane to transport Trinh Xuan Thanh, who Germany said was kidnapped in a Berlin park last July.
Distant_Historical	Thanh, who had sought political asylum in Germany, was sentenced to life in prison in January for violating state regulations and embezzlement.
Main_Consequence	The Slovak Foreign Ministry said on Thursday it had summoned the Vietnamese ambassador to relay its questions and concern over the case.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If these allegations are confirmed, we will see it as a serious incident with a negative impact on our bilateral relations,” the ministry said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“We strongly refuse that Slovakia had anything to do with such act ... “
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It said it may take further diplomatic steps if Vietnam does not provide a credible explanation.
Cause_General	The Vietnamese government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside office hours.
Distant_Evaluation	On Wednesday, Slovakia’s Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini distanced the government from the report that Slovakia helped Vietnam with the alleged kidnapping and also said there was no evidence that Thanh was on the plane.
Distant_Evaluation	“The only possible explanation would be an abuse of Slovakia’s hospitality, but nothing suggests that was the case so far,” Pellegrini told reporters before leaving for a meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Distant_Historical	Slovakia lent a government plane to a Vietnamese delegation last year to fly to Moscow from Bratislava after a meeting between then-interior minister Robert Kalinak and Vietnam’s minister of public security, To Lam.
Distant_Historical	Kalinak told Slovak news website www.aktuality.sk that the Vietnamese delegation was supposed to fly out of Vienna, just 45 km (28 miles) west of Bratislava, but requested the plane after its itinerary changed unexpectedly.
Distant_Historical	According to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, the car supposedly used for the abduction was parked in front of the Slovak government hotel where the Slovak-Vietnamese meeting was held three days after the abduction, according to GPS records.
Cause_General	Thanh, a former high flyer in Vietnam who was accused of mismanagement and causing losses at PetroVietnam Construction JSC, has been given two life sentences in Vietnam since he was brought home.
Cause_General	A Vietnamese man has been brought to trial in Germany for allegedly helping in the kidnapping.

Main	LIMA, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) -- Peru's Supreme Court on Wednesday overturned the humanitarian pardon of ex-president, Alberto Fujimori, and ordered the former head of state be captured and returned to prison to serve the rest of his sentence for human rights abuses.
Main	Judge Hugo Nunez Julca, president of the Supreme Investigation Court of the Supreme Court, declared that the pardon, granted in December 2017 by former president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, was unlawful.
Distant_Evaluation	The pardon was heavily criticized by opposition and human rights groups, who claimed it was Kuczynski's attempt to avoid impeachment by allies of the former president.
Distant_Historical	Kuczynski resigned in March following the release of a video showing his allies trying to buy votes from opposition lawmakers ahead of a second impeachment vote in the corruption scandal.
Main	Judge Julca ordered Fujimori, 80, be captured and returned to prison to see out the remaining 14 years of his 25 year sentence, the Supreme Court said through Twitter.
Distant_Historical	Fujimori, in power from 1990 to 2000, was sentenced in April 2009 for human rights abuses, including being responsible for the killings of 25 people, including an 8-year-old boy, in the Barrios Altos and La Cantuta neighborhoods of Lima.
Distant_Historical	The massacres were carried out by the paramilitary group Colina in 1991 and 1992 respectively.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Fujimori's lawyer, Miguel Perez, said he would appeal the ruling, and added that the judge's decision ""is not an immediate order."""
Cause_General	Perez stated that he had not yet been able to speak to Fujimori because the former president had just learned of the decision.
Distant_Evaluation	Wednesday's ruling surprised politicians and Peruvians alike.
Cause_General	Despite the country's government, headed by President Martin Vizcarra, making good headway with anti-corruption reforms, the nation's Congress is controlled by opposition parties.
Cause_General	The largest opposition party is the Popular Force (FP) party, led by Alberto Fujimori's daughter, Keiko Fujimori.
Distant_Evaluation	"The visibly upset Keiko Fujimori declared the ruling to be ""persecution."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""Without doubt this is a persecution and not just against my family."
Distant_Evaluation	Enough.
Distant_Evaluation	"I feel the hate and cruelty from of all our political enemies,"" she said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""This decision is unjust, inhumane, and will be appealed,"" added the FP leader."
Distant_Evaluation	However, Salvador Heresi, leader of the Peruvians for Change (PPK) party which was founded by former President Kuczynski, requested that politicians accept the court's decision.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The Supreme Court must be respected by Congress,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	Heresi stressed that Peruvian politics already faces many challenges and that further questions over the ruling may be unhelpful.
Cause_Specific	The Supreme Court's decision came following a recommendation from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which declared the pardon to be illegal.
Main	BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian President Ivan Duque’s campaign promise to eschew traditional deal-making with the legislature may make it hard for him to pass business-friendly tax proposals, modifications to a peace deal with Marxist rebels and other measures that are unpopular with some centrist and leftist legislators.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Duque took office early last month with a thin legislative majority, and will struggle even before proposed laws reach the floor.
Cause_General	His government lacks majorities in several of the committees where lawmakers initially discuss bills.
Main	Yet he has pledged to stop special interest groups from trading support for politicians for government favors or funding.
Distant_Evaluation	Colombians call the practice “marmalade” because money and influence are spread around.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Opposition politicians have scoffed at the promise, saying Duque will be obliged to make deals to get his laws through.
Cause_General	Graft has become a major issue in Colombia following a raft of scandals involving everything from vote-buying to embezzlement from a school lunch program.
Cause_General	Nearly 12 million voters backed anti-corruption measures in a referendum last month, and at least 10 current or retired lawmakers were investigated or tried in a scandal involving kickbacks by Brazilian construction company Odebrecht.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But Duque’s promises to avoid backroom dealings could limit his ability to pass measures needed to salvage the country’s investment grade credit rating and keep his promise to tighten restrictions on former FARC rebels.
Cause_General	His coalition has a slender Senate majority of 54 out of 106 seats.
Cause_General	In the lower house his backers hold just 83 of 170 seats, which is less than half.
Distant_Evaluation	“He has a weak majority and the challenge is big because Duque is trying to do politics without handing out jobs or contracts to lawmakers,” political analyst Marcela Prieto said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Changing that political culture will not be easy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It will cost him a lot to pass his legislative proposals.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Duque’s weak backing has analysts and ratings agencies worried that he will have trouble passing an expansion of the tax base and cuts to duties for companies.
Cause_General	Colombia has an investment grade rating and a stable outlook from Fitch and S&P.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Political fragmentation or confrontation may complicate the task of passing those reforms,” Samar Maziad, vice-president of Moody’s said.
Distant_Evaluation	“That’s part of the negative outlook we have on the rating.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The government has forecast that Colombia’s $300 billion economy will grow 2.7 percent this year.
Cause_General	It has a 3.1 percent deficit target for 2018, and a quarter of local Treasury bonds are held by foreign investors.
Cause_General	Beyond his Democratic Center party, Duque has the Conservatives, the U Party and four others in his stable.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some members of U Party, which led a governing coalition under ex-President Juan Manuel Santos, have said they will not back the administration.
Cause_General	Centrist parties likes the Liberals and Radical Change have declined to join the coalition, making their votes wild cards.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Duque has also pledged to push through a justice system modernization and modify the 2016 peace deal that allowed FARC rebels to demobilize and form a political party.
Distant_Evaluation	Ex-guerrillas accused of war crimes should be tried before they take up political posts, Duque has said, but changing the deal would require two-thirds majorities.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lawmakers from independent parties could tilt the balance in Duque’s favor.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They may be more likely to back the tax and justice system reforms and anti-corruption measures that proved popular in the recent referendum, including a three-term limit for lawmakers.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“When we’re not supporting him, he’ll have problems,” said Senator German Varon of the Radical Change party.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Opposition Senator Jorge Robledo, from the left-wing Democratic Pole, says independents may back the government if offers of patronage are on the table.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“With clientelism they’ll arrange majorities,” Robledo said.
Distant_Evaluation	“That isn’t to say that the president won’t have hurdles, problems, that could cause him a crisis.”
Main	(Reuters) - The bitter fight over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh spilled over into a key U.S. Senate race in Indiana on Monday, as the Republican challenger, Mike Braun squared off against Joe Donnelly, the Democratic incumbent.
Cause_General	Braun, a businessman, hammered Donnelly over his opposition to President Donald Trump’s latest nomination to the top court, seeking momentum in a race that polls show to be tight a month before Nov. 6 elections that will determine control of Congress.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Democrats need to gain a net total of two seats to win control of the Senate, which will require defending seats in several states that voted for Trump in 2016, including Indiana.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Control of the Senate would allow them to block moves by Trump, including Supreme Court nominees.
Error	Reuters Interactive Can Democrats regain control of the House?
Distant_Evaluation	Donnelly, who is seeking a second Senate term, has been a top target of Republicans in a state Trump won by almost 20 percentage points two years ago.
Distant_Evaluation	“I voted against Judge Kavanaugh because of concerns about his impartiality and concerns about his judicial temperament,” Donnelly said early in the first debate between the candidates, held in Westville, Indiana, a small town in the northwest corner of the state.
Cause_General	Kavanaugh was accused by California university professor Christine Blasey Ford of sexual assaulting her when they were high school students in 1982.
Cause_General	He mounted a passionate defense of his innocence in the Senate and was confirmed by 50-48 in a near-party-line vote on Saturday.
Distant_Evaluation	Braun’s campaign has pointed to Donnelly’s “no” vote as a lack of support for the Republican president’s agenda.
Distant_Evaluation	On Monday, Braun charged that Donnelly was unwilling to buck his party in opposing Kavanaugh.
Distant_Evaluation	“Democrats including Joe Donnelly will do or say anything when it comes to their political interests,” Braun said.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is a blood sport.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Republicans believe the fight over Kavanaugh has engaged conservative voters who otherwise have not been paying attention to the elections and may make a difference in several close Senate races.

Distant_Evaluation	Donnelly accused Braun of not supporting insurance coverage for pre-existing healthcare conditions in the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, an attack line that has been a staple of Democratic campaigns.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Braun pledged during the debate that he would never support a replacement for Obamacare “unless it covered pre-existing conditions.”

Main	TOKYO, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba on Friday held a policy debate on a variety of pivotal issues as campaigning continues ahead of next week's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) leadership contest.
Main	"Abe, who if he wins his third successive three-year term as head of the LDP, will effectively become Japan's longest serving prime minister, pledged to address Japan's severe demographic issues, calling Japan's aging and shrinking population a ""national crisis."""
Main	He proposed to overhaul the social welfare system to allow workers who are aged 65 or older to continue working beyond their retirement age, as well as allowing people aged over 70 to chose for themselves when to start receiving pension payouts.
Main	Ishiba, for his part, highlighted the fact that the funding necessary for the country's social welfare system must be secured, and reiterated his stance on revitalizing regional economies as they could become potential new growth drivers.
Main	He said that he does not believe that big businesses expanding will have any benefit on regional economies.
Cause_General	In terms of social security costs, the government has requested a record high budget of 102.5 trillion yen (916 billion U.S. dollars) for fiscal year 2019, with Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare asking for 31.90 trillion yen (285 billion U.S. dollars), a new record high and a 2.5 percent increase from the previous budget, as it continues to grapple with swelling spending on welfare costs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	According to the ministry, its expenditure is set to rocket to more than 32 trillion yen (286 billion U.S. dollars), up by about 600 billion yen (5.36 billion U.S. dollars).
Cause_General	"This comes against a backdrop of various iterations of the prime minister's ""Abenomics"" brand of economic policies, yet Japan, the world's third largest economy, has a public debt amounting to 236 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), which remains the worst in the industrialized world."
Main	"Ishiba, during Friday's debate, voiced his criticism of ""Abenomics,"" which has failed to fix or significantly impact Japan's woeful fiscal health, while the Bank of Japan continues to struggle to definitively pull the nation out of deflation and hit its lofty 2 percent inflation target."
Main	As for other key themes, Abe said his career goal of amending Japan's pacifist constitution remained unchanged.
Main	"""I'm determined to start a new era for Japan by tackling what we haven't been able to do for the past 70 years since the end of the war, a constitutional revision,"" said Abe."
Main	The prime minister wants to specifically reference the Self-Defense Forces in the constitution so as there is no ambiguity about their constitutionality.
Main	But Ishiba, who has taken a cautious stance towards Abe's plans, maintained that the Constitution should not be amended without a full and sincere explanation to the public.
Main	"""It doesn't mean all is well as long as the SDF is written,"" Ishiba argued."
Main	He said that he disagrees with Abe's methodology of changing the charter and said they both remain duty-bound to present all the facts to the public as that is where sovereignty resides.
Main	He added that a more fundamental approach should be taken.
Main	On disaster prevention, as the nation has been battered by torrential rains, typhoons and earthquakes recently, Abe vowed to carry out emergency measures over the next three years to help prevent and mitigate the effects of disasters when they occur and improve the nation's resilience.
Main	Ishiba said that a dedicated government office that specializes in disaster preparedness should be created and overseen by a minister, with its staff in a state of preparedness 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Distant_Evaluation	The return of the 36-year-old musician, known by his stage name of Bobi Wine, has rattled the government headed by 74-year-old President Yoweri Museveni, who has been in power since 1986 and leads a nation where nearly 80 percent of the population is below the age of 30.
Distant_Evaluation	Though a political novice — he was elected in a parliamentary by-election last year — Kyagulanyi’s popularity has skyrocketed particularly among disillusioned youths who say they see few prospects under the rule of Museveni.
Cause_General	When Kyagulanyi arrived at Entebbe International Airport from the United States, police escorted him into a vehicle and whisked him to the capital Kampala where his whereabouts were for a time unknown, leading supporters for a while to fear he had been arrested.
Cause_General	He had received medical treatment in the United States for injuries which he said were sustained during torture by security forces last month.
Distant_Evaluation	The government has denied any mistreatment but says it is investigating.
Cause_General	But Kyagulanyi later appeared atop a car outside his home in Kampala to address hundreds of cheering supporters.
Main	“I am resuming immediately ...
Main	I am on the mission already, I am on the fight for freedom and liberty already,” he said, surrounded by throngs of people.
Main	Leaning on a cane, he said his “desire for liberty” was as strong as “the desire of the millions and millions of people in Uganda to be free.” Ugandans, he said, were “slaves in our own country”.
Cause_General	His supporters had earlier in the day defied a heavy security presence and gathered at his residence to welcome him, but once he arrived by police escort, security forces did not attempt to stop crowds from gathering at his home.
Cause_General	Many of his supporters wore red t-shirts and hats.
Cause_General	The color has come to be associated with his “People Power” movement, and demonstrators at Ugandan embassies in London, Nairobi and elsewhere have donned the same color during protests.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Police had on Wednesday banned rallies to welcome Kyagulanyi home and said they would escort him to his home.
Cause_General	The legal basis for the escort was unclear.
Cause_General	Ahead of Kyagulanyi’s arrival, security forces had deployed around the airport and the highway linking it to Kampala to prevent supporters from greeting him.
Cause_General	Armored personnel carriers and police vehicles lined the route and journalists were prevented from traveling to the airport to cover the arrival.
Distant_Evaluation	Kyagulanyi is increasingly seen as posing a significant challenge to Museveni, who has ruled since 1986.
Distant_Evaluation	His message - that young Ugandans need a dynamic new head of state to tackle the myriad problems they face - has electrified citizens who say they are fed up with corruption, unemployment, and state repression of dissent.
Distant_Evaluation	The government denies allegations of corruption and of stifling opposition.
Cause_General	Museveni has won praise in the West for his support against militant Islam and his role as power-broker in the volatile Great Lakes Region.
Cause_General	Uganda has also welcomed foreign investors such as France’s Total, China’s CNOOC and Britain’s Tullow as part of a plan to start pumping oil from 2021.

Cause_General	But the government is facing growing criticism from its allies, particularly main donors the United States and the European Union, who have deplored the torture alleged by opposition politicians including Kyagulanyi.
Cause_General	Kyagulanyi attracted a youth following through songs critical of Museveni and his status rose higher due to an incident in August in which his driver was shot dead and he was detained and charged with treason over what authorities said was the stoning of the president’s convoy.
Cause_General	The politician, who has pleaded not guilty to the treason charges, said he was beaten with an iron bar in detention in northern Uganda.
Distant_Evaluation	The government denies that he was mistreated.

Cause_General	The country of 2 million, a quarter of whom are ethnic Russians, is a frontline state in Europe’s and NATO’s increasingly tense relationship with Vladimir Putin.
Distant_Evaluation	The pro-Russia party Harmony remained the biggest with 20 percent, due to its support from Russian-speakers, but will find it difficult to get in government as parties that oppose it because of its Moscow ties won enough votes.
Distant_Evaluation	Latvia has long been plagued by corruption and money-laundering issues.
Cause_General	The country’s central bank governor is currently awaiting trial for accepting a bribe.
Cause_Specific	In part because of those issues, two newcomers, populist party KPV LV and anti-corruption party the New Conservatives, both won around 14 percent of the vote each to became the second- and third-biggest parties.
Distant_Evaluation	“This political party doesn’t take instructions or orders, whims of its founders, supporters or various other people who stand behind it,” Janis Bordans, party leader for the New Conservatives, told supporters after the election.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Faith in the rule of law will return to the people!”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The new parliament will be more fragmented and a broad coalition of ethnic Latvian parties is seen as the most likely outcome by political analysts.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, with seven parties winning seats, coalition talks could go on for weeks or months.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Forming a new government will be very difficult,” current Prime Minister Māris Kucinskis of the Union of Greens and Farmers said after the election.
Distant_Evaluation	The ruling coalition consisting of his party, the National Alliance and the Unity party appear to have lost almost half of its votes.
Distant_Evaluation	“The messages that the voters have tried to send is that we’re going to have some new faces in politics,” Janis Ikstens, political scientist at Latvia University, told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	“And perhaps they’re not happy with the neglect of social needs.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Before the election, some Latvians feared a strong result for Harmony and KPV could lead to them forming a government and bringing the Latvia’s foreign policy closer to Putin’s Russia.
Distant_Evaluation	But given the result, that looks unlikely, according to Ikstens.
Cause_General	Harmony recently rebranded itself as a Western-style Social Democratic party, saying it is committed to the European Union and NATO.
Distant_Evaluation	But it only last year ended its official cooperation agreement with Putin’s United Russia Party, raising concerns its transformation is only skin deep.
Cause_General	Latvia, a member of the European Union and NATO, shares a 276-kilometre (167 miles) border with Russia.
Cause_General	NATO currently has more than 1,000 troops deployed in the Baltic country of 2 million and even the potential of a minor shift in allegiance in Latvia will worry both Brussels and Washington.

Cause_General	(Reuters) - Mitt Romney’s restart of his political career hit a roadblock Saturday.
Main	The 2012 Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts governor failed to win the Utah Republican Party’s nomination, which means he must face 11 challengers in a June primary for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Sen. Orrin Hatch.
Cause_Specific	Romney needed at least 60 percent of the votes from delegates at the Utah GOP convention Saturday to head to the November election unopposed, but he earned only 49.12 percent, CNN and other media reported.
Distant_Evaluation	Romney was considered the political favorite by political observers and U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed Romney in February.
Distant_Evaluation	The president said on Twitter in February that Romney “will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement!”
Cause_General	But Romney and the president have not always been political allies.
Distant_Historical	Romney excoriated Trump in the 2016 presidential campaign and said he was a “fraud” who was “playing the American public for suckers.” Trump responded that Romney had “choked like a dog” in his 2012 campaign against President Barack Obama.
Distant_Historical	Despite the criticism, Trump briefly considered making Romney his Secretary of State.
Distant_Evaluation	Romney said in February that he generally approves of Trump’s agenda, but would call out the president if needed.

Distant_Evaluation	“I’m with the president’s domestic policy agenda of low taxes, low regulation, smaller government, pushing back against the bureaucrats,” Romney said.
Distant_Evaluation	“I’m not always with the president on what he might say or do, and if that happens I’ll call them like I see them, the way I have in the past.”
Distant_Evaluation	Romney was criticized by some delegates for being a latecomer to the state, moving to Utah relatively recently, CNN reported.
Cause_General	Romney’s campaign could not be reached for comment early Sunday.
Main	NEW DELHI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - India has launched its first national register of sex offenders in a bid to stem crimes against women as the country reels from a series of high-profile rape cases.
Main	The database will be accessible only to law enforcement agencies and not to the public, with 440,000 names registered, including those convicted of rape, gang rape, child sex crimes and sexual harassment, according to a home ministry statement.
Main	It will also provide their photos, addresses and fingerprints, without compromising “any individual’s privacy”.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The National Database on Sexual Offenders (NDSO) ... will assist in effectively tracking and investigating cases of sexual offences,” the ministry said in the statement late Thursday.
Cause_Specific	The register comes as a spate of sexual assault cases have rocked the country, which was named the most dangerous in the world for women by experts in a survey published by the Thomson Reuters Foundation in June.
Cause_General	Earlier this week, police arrested the principal and four staff members of a boarding school in northern India over the rape of a teenage student.
Cause_General	Police said they detained four male students for the rape, which left the girl pregnant.
Distant_Evaluation	The school staff are accused of destroying evidence and covering up the crime.
Cause_General	In southern Kerala state, protests and calls grew this week for the arrest of a bishop accused of repeatedly raping a nun over a period of two years.
Cause_General	In August, police in northern Uttar Pradesh state rescued 20 girls and three boys from a home where they were sold for sex.
Cause_General	That raid came just weeks after police rescued nearly 30 girls who were sexually assaulted and tortured at a shelter in Bihar state.
Distant_Evaluation	PRIVACY CONCERNS
Distant_Historical	The urgency to establish a sex offenders register gained momentum following nationwide outcry over the rape and murder of a Muslim girl in a Hindu-dominated area of Jammu and Kashmir state earlier this year.
Cause_General	The accused, all Hindus, are currently on trial.
Cause_General	The case prompted the government to approve the death penalty for the rape of girls under 12, and also increase the prison term for the rape of older girls and women.
Distant_Evaluation	Despite various measures, India’s rape epidemic has shown no sign of dying down.
Distant_Historical	More than 100 cases were reported daily in India in 2016, the latest government data shows.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	An op-ed piece in the Hindustan Times newspaper on Friday called the new sex offenders register “timely”, but worried the government could overreach and misuse data, and warned it “may tarnish a person’s life forever if he is reformed”.
Distant_Anecdotal	Jayshree Bajoria of Human Rights Watch had similar concerns, telling the Thomson Reuters Foundation that even a rumor could prove dangerous in a country where incidents of mob justice have spiked recently.
Distant_Anecdotal	“For any real change, the government must do the hard work of actually implementing the laws and policies” that were put in place after the gang rape of a young woman in Delhi in 2012 on a moving bus, she said.
Distant_Anecdotal	Bajoria urged authorities to focus on supporting and protecting victims of sexual assault to ensure they are able to report crimes and receive justice without facing stigma and harassment.
Cause_General	Many countries, such as the United States, Britain and South Africa keep a record of people who have been convicted of sexual offences such as pedophilia and rape.
Cause_General	The United States, for example, has an online database which is open to the public.
Cause_General	It provides information including the offender’s photograph and address, as well as details of the crime.
Cause_General	In other countries, such as Britain, the policy entails offenders registering with their local police station.
Cause_General	Key people within the community such as doctors, youth leaders, landlords are informed and police monitor the offender.
Main	Issuing a stinging challenge to President Bush, the Senate on Thursday approved a spending measure that provided more than $97.5 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but ordered troop withdrawals from Iraq to begin within 120 days and set a goal of removing most armed forces within a year.
Cause_General	Democrats, preparing for a veto fight, immediately sought to paint the president as obstinate in the face of broad public sentiment against the war.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They said he would be the one abandoning American forces should he reject a final bill that lawmakers expected to produce in a few weeks.
Distant_Evaluation	''If the president vetoes this bill, it is an asterisk in history,'' said Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, after a vote of 51 to 47 on the measure.
Distant_Evaluation	''He sets the record for undermining the troops more than any president we have ever had.''
Distant_Evaluation	But Mr. Bush was not wavering.
Distant_Evaluation	He stood on the North Portico of the White House, flanked by Republican House leaders, and delivered his veto threat one more time.
Distant_Evaluation	''We stand united in saying loud and clear that when we've got a troop in harm's way, we expect that troop to be fully funded,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''And we've got commanders making tough decisions on the ground, we expect there to be no strings on our commanders.
Distant_Evaluation	And that we expect the Congress to be wise about how they spend the people's money.''
Cause_General	Two Republicans, Senators Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Gordon Smith of Oregon, joined 49 Democrats in backing the bill, which totaled $123 billion when money for Gulf Coast hurricane relief, agricultural aid and other domestic projects was added.
Cause_General	The bill also includes the Democratic plan to raise the minimum wage by $2.15 over two years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Reid promised that negotiators would quickly begin to reconcile the new Senate measure with a version passed by the House last week and have a bill ready to be approved and sent to the president soon after the House returns from its spring break on April 16.
Distant_Evaluation	The administration has said the military needs the money by April 15, and the White House said Thursday that the Pentagon was already having to juggle accounts, shifting money from one program to another to buy more vehicles better able to withstand mines.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Dana Perino, the deputy White House spokeswoman, said, ''This, again, underscores the need to get the show on the road, get the bill to the president, he will veto it, and then, we'll take it from there.''
Distant_Evaluation	Democrats said the president was at fault there as well, saying he took too long to send his financing request to Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	They also dismissed Republican complaints that they were micromanaging military policy, saying that Congress had Constitutional authority equal to that of the executive branch and that Democrats were forced to intercede because of Mr. Bush's refusal to heed public demands for withdrawing forces.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''It begins to return Iraq to the Iraqi people and to return our troops home,'' Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said about the legislation.
Distant_Evaluation	Republicans said the measure was a colossal mistake that told insurgent forces in Iraq when American troops would begin leaving.
Distant_Evaluation	''We are sending mixed messages to the world, we are sending mixed messages to our allies, we are sending a clear message to our enemies: when the times get too tough, America's going to walk away regardless of what's going on on the ground,'' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, the chairwoman of the Republican Policy Committee.
Distant_Evaluation	''We're putting a bull's-eye on our troops with boots on the ground.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Though both the House and Senate have now called for military exits from Iraq, they must resolve significant differences between their approaches.
Cause_General	The Senate bill, saying American troops ''should not be policing a civil war,'' directs Mr. Bush to begin moving troops out of the country within 120 days of the measure becoming law, ''with the goal of redeploying, by March 31, 2008, all United States combat forces.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The House measure ties its push for withdrawal to the ability of the Iraqi government to meet certain objectives but is more definitive about a pullout, calling for most troops to be removed by Sept. 1, 2008.
Distant_Evaluation	The bills differ in many details as well.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said Thursday that he was confident that lawmakers in the two chambers would reach agreement and that he expected Mr. Bush would ultimately make a deal with Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	''Nicaragua ended with a compromise,'' Mr. Obey said.
Distant_Evaluation	''El Salvador ended with a compromise.
Distant_Evaluation	Vietnam did, too.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The president will compromise.''
Distant_Evaluation	Representative John P. Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat who has led the push for a new Iraq policy, said that simply responding to American public sentiment was reason enough for the administration at least to try to negotiate with Congress.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''This will take a lot of conversation with the White House, the Defense Department, unless they don't want to negotiate,'' Mr. Murtha said in an interview, playing down the veto threat.
Distant_Evaluation	''That's always the way it sounds, but it seldom ends up that way.''
Cause_General	For all the public confrontation between the president and the Democratic leaders of Congress, Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Bush were chatting amicably on Thursday afternoon in the Capitol Rotunda during a ceremony honoring the Tuskegee Airmen.
Distant_Evaluation	Among the topics, aides later said, was the Iraq spending bill and how they intend to break their deadlock.

Cause_General	On the website of Moscow region’s election commission, Monson is listed as fourth on the ruling United Russia party’s list of candidates for the Krasnogorsk city council.
Cause_General	United Russia won 47.9 percent of this vote, automatically securing a seat for the MMA fighter, who was born in the U.S. state of Minnesota.
Cause_General	Writing on social media, Monson, who has previously cultivated ties to the Russian Communist Party, said he ran as an independent.
Distant_Evaluation	“I was invited by United Russia party to run but I am independent.
Distant_Evaluation	Unfortunately I learned there are no communists in Communist party in Russia,” Monson said on Monday.
Distant_Historical	Monson, a vocal critic of U.S. foreign policy, said in January 2016 he was applying for Russian citizenship because he had felt a solidarity with the Russian people since he first visited their country in 2011.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I have big plans for work with children, am preparing various projects, including projects focused on promoting healthy lifestyles,” Monson was cited as saying on election day by the local division of the United Russia party.

Main	ADEN, Yemen, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- The Saudi-backed Yemeni government and the Houthi rebels concluded the UN-sponsored peace talks in Sweden on Thursday with an agreement on cease-fire in the flashpoint Red Sea port city of Hodeidah.
Cause_General	They also agreed to withdraw the warring forces within days, a significant progress witnessed by the UN chief Antonio Guterres who participated in the Yemeni negotiating teams at the closing ceremony of the seven-day peace talks.
Distant_Evaluation	Guterres said what was done during the talks was an important step for the benefit of the Yemeni people.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""You have reached an agreement on Hodeidah port and city, which will see a mutual re-deployment of forces from the port and the city, and the establishment of a province-wide cease-fire,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""The UN will play a leading role in the port,"" he added."
Cause_General	According to a statement from the UN Special Envoy for Yemen Martin Griffiths, the parties reached an agreement on the city of Hodeidah and the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Issa, an executive mechanism on activating the prisoner exchange agreement, and a statement of understanding on Taiz.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"The two warring sides will be committed ""to fully implementing the agreement and to working toward the removal of any obstructions or impediments to its implementation; and to refraining from any action, escalation or decisions that would undermine the prospects for full implementation of the agreement,"" the statement said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The delegations representing the two sides will be committed to continuing the consultations unconditionally in January 2019 in a location to be agreed upon in Sweden, it added.
Distant_Evaluation	Yemeni political analysts and observers praised Sweden's deal and considered it a significant win for the exhausted Yemeni people and a key breakthrough for the UN-sponsored talks aimed at ending the country's conflict.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But some fear the interpretation and the implementation of Hodeidah's cease-fire deal and other agreements will be likely more difficult than the announcement.
Distant_Anecdotal	Abdul-Raqeeb Hidyani, a political analyst and writer, told Xinhua that Sweden's deal was an important step in the long road of solving Yemen's complicated issue that caused these tragedies.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""The implementation and the interpretation of the agreements in Sweden is the most important thing because many previous agreements failed just days after the signing ceremonies,"" Hidyani said."
Distant_Anecdotal	Nadwa Dawsari, a Yemeni researcher and conflict specialist, said it's too early to get excited about the new deal.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""The devil is in the details."
Distant_Anecdotal	"At best, it will lead to improving humanitarian conditions and easing some tensions, but it will be highly unlikely lead to ending the conflict,"" he warned."
Distant_Anecdotal	Yahya Abu Hatim, a strategic military expert and observer, said Houthis is likely the only side that benefits from the agreements.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""The Houthis participated in the talks just to show themselves in front of the international community as a group that respect politics and that is not true because Houthis did not respect many political agreements in the past and only resort to military actions,"" he said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Sources confirmed that the withdrawal of the warring forces from Hodeidah will be conducted within 14 days in two phases.
Cause_General	The two parties have been discussing the details of re-opening the airport in Sanaa, de-escalation measures in both Taiz and Hodeidah, and implementation of the agreement on exchanging prisoners, as well as the economic situation, Griffiths said.
Cause_General	Yemen has been mired in a civil war since 2014 when the Houthi rebels overtook the capital Sanaa and toppled the government of President Abd-Rabbuh Mansour Hadi.
Cause_General	A Saudi-led coalition has been fighting the Houthis since 2015.
Cause_General	The war has killed more than 10,000 people and created the world's worst humanitarian crisis.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The latest peace talks tackled a wide range of substantive issues, with the aim of putting Yemen back on the path of peace, and alleviating the suffering of the Yemeni people.

Main	BERLIN, Nov. 5 (Xinhua) -- Hans-Georg Maassen, the controversial former president of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) in Germany, is considering launching a new career in politics instead of taking up a replacement post offered to him at the country's interior ministry, German media reported on Monday.
Cause_Specific	"The reports cited the transcript of a speech which Maassen recently delivered before the ""Bern Club"" of international intelligence chiefs and was subsequently sent to BfV employees in an internal message."
Cause_Specific	"""I can certainly also image a life outside of civil service, for example in politics or business,"" an excerpt of the document read."
Cause_General	The Maassen affair, which first began when the ex-BfV president publicly questioned the authenticity of video-footage depicting far-right violence in Chemnitz in September, has recently taken another twist as a consequence of the defiant speech.
Distant_Evaluation	"Even before the full texts was published, media reported on Sunday that the interior ministry was preparing to retract an offer for Maassen to assume a new post there because he had doubled-down on earlier Chemintz-related comments and launched a searing attack on alleged ""left-radical"" elements in the German Social Democrat (SPD) party when addressing the ""Bern Club""."
Distant_Evaluation	"""From my perspective, this was a welcome opportunity for left-radical forces in the SPD which were always against as coalition with the CDU/CSU to provoke a break-up of this coalition,"" Maassen said."
Cause_General	"Earlier, the ruling ""grand coalition"" formed by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Christian Social Union (CSU) and SPD reached an awkward and ultimately short-lived compromise to remove Maassen from the BfV by transferring him to a more senior and better-paid position as secretary of state in the interior ministry led by Horst Seehofer (CSU)."
Cause_General	Faced with an angry public backlash, the government was then forced to backtrack on the decision again and announced that it would instead make Maassen an advisor to Seehofer.
Distant_Evaluation	"Responding to the latest revelations surrounding Maassen's incendiary speech, SPD secretary general Lars Klingbeil criticized the departing BfV president's ""inappropriate"" statements and urged Seehofer to reach a final decision on his future at the interior ministry."
Cause_General	According to the Funke media group, Maassen has himself already requested to be retired rather than taking up the replacement post created for him at the interior ministry.
Cause_General	"Today, a ""disappointed"" interior minister Seehofer personally informed the public that Maasen would be sent to early retirement because of ""inacceptable statements""."

Error	(Xinhua/Chen Jing)
Main	KAMPALA, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- Uganda, the host of the largest number of mountain gorillas in the world, has called for continued efforts to conserve the primates despite their population going up.
Main	Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), a state conservation agency, in a statement to Xinhua on Thursday said more efforts are needed to conserve the giant apes if their number is to continue growing.
Main	"""We don't have to be complacent, more is still needed, we have to ensure the population of mountain gorillas continue to increase, this will happen if we put poaching to zero levels and ensuring they don't contract diseases that can kill them,"" the statement said."
Cause_Specific	The statement follows a report by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, which announced that mountain gorillas had been struck off their Red List of Threatened Species.
Cause_Specific	The body said on Thursday that mountain gorillas among others were no longer a threatened species since their world population had surpassed the 1,000 mark.
Cause_General	The increase in the number is attributed to the conservation efforts by the three host countries, Uganda, Rwanda and Democratic Republic of Congo.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	UWA said it will intensify its anti poaching campaigns and do day and night patrols to protect the gorillas.
Cause_General	Mountain gorillas, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, were a highly endangered sub-species of primate.
Cause_General	They live in forests that have suffered from considerable human impact in the form of timber extraction and other human activity.
Cause_General	The primates are also a major source of tourism revenue to countries that host them.
Cause_General	According to UWA, tourists who come to see the gorillas contribute a considerable percentage to Uganda's tourism revenue.
Cause_General	Uganda earns over 1.4 billion U.S. dollars from the tourism sector annually.

Main	“Engage with Labour, work with us,” was the message from Labour’s envoy for financial services to businessmen and women at a business drinks reception at the party’s annual conference.
Cause_General	With Brexit negotiations at an impasse and Prime Minister Theresa May’s future uncertain, Labour and business — at times uneasy bedfellows since veteran leftist Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader in 2015 — are taking more notice of each other.
Cause_General	Alongside its conference in the northern city of Liverpool, Labour has run a business forum attended by more than 100 business people, including representatives from major investment banks, seeking to shape the party’s business pitch.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We take huge pride in the UK being a global financial center, there will always be a seat at the table for the finance sector with us,” Labour’s financial services spokesman Jonathan Reynolds told the business drinks event.
Distant_Evaluation	“Remember the Labour Party now counts a membership in the hundreds of thousands,” he added.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Discussions that are being had here at conference ... will have a relevance for the economy and for your businesses going forward.”
Cause_General	Hours earlier, Labour’s would-be finance minister John McDonnell set out plans to “shift the balance of power” to ordinary people with policies including nationalizing key industries, putting workers on boards and handing employees up to 10 percent of company shares.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Labour has also said that in government it will raise corporation tax, increase income tax for the highly paid and introduce a financial transaction tax, hoping to break with policies it says were responsible for the 2008 financial crisis.
Distant_Evaluation	“The concern that arises for so many businesses is that when they hear the tone and content of the speeches in the conference hall, there is a chilling effect,” Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is a litany of things one after the other that really just sets an unhelpful tone,” said Marshall, whose organization represents 75,000 companies employing nearly six million people, calling on Labour to do more to allay business concerns about the impacts of some of their policy proposals.
Distant_Evaluation	ON THE BOARDROOM AGENDA
Distant_Evaluation	But after Labour’s plan to end austerity and borrow to invest in public services captured the imagination of voters at a snap election last year, reducing May to a minority government, business has no option but to engage.
Cause_General	Labour said the exhibition zone at conference, which features businesses including tech firm Google, transport manufacturer Bombardier and oil company BP, was the largest and most lucrative it has been since Corbyn became leader.
Cause_General	Of 165 stands, 22 are new exhibitors.
Cause_General	There is a also a small business zone with six exhibitors.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are definitely seeing an increase in interest from clients preparing, contingency planning, for a Labour government, particularly in financial services,” said one attendee at the business drinks, who worked for a business advisory firm.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is on the boardroom agenda.”
Cause_General	May’s Conservatives have traditionally considered themselves the party of business, advocating free markets and lower taxes, but relations between government and business have been strained by worries over the impact leaving the EU will have on business.

Main	WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. senator on Monday called on the U.S. intelligence community to issue a public assessment report on the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Main	"CIA chief Gina Haspel and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats should ""come out and provide the American people and the Congress with a public assessment of who ordered the killing of Jamal Khashoggi,"" Ron Wyden, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, was quoted by U.S. political media The Hill as saying in a statement."
Main	"Wyden, a democrat from the state of Oregon, also repeated his demand in a tweet later in the day, calling on the U.S. intelligence leaders to ""provide a public assessment"" over the death of Khashoggi."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said the U.S. full report over the death of Khashoggi would come in the next two days.
Distant_Evaluation	"While Turmp described the coming CIA report as ""a very premature"" one, U.S. media, citing insiders, reported on Friday that the CIA has concluded that the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered to kill Khashoggi."
Cause_General	It was not clear if the report will be made public.
Cause_Specific	Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, has been missing since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Cause_Specific	"The Saudi authorities said that Khashoggi died in a ""brawl"" in its consulate."
Cause_General	After releasing the results of its initial investigation, the Saudi Public Prosecution announced that 18 people were arrested for their alleged connections with the killing.
Cause_General	U.S. Congress has urged a thorough investigation of the case, and threatened to take more actions against Saudi Arabia if those responsible were not held accountable, such as suspending U.S. military sales.
Main	VILNIUS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite called for legislative changes to boost transparency in the country's political process on Thursday, following a probe by the Parliamentary Committee on Nation Security and Defense (NSGK) on business influence on politics.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Grybauskaite said she hopes the findings of NSGK about the influence of business groups on politics would lead to real actions aimed at improving transparency in political processes.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We hope the half-year work by the Parliamentary Committee on National Security and Defense would also lead to amendments and new judicial instruments to improve transparency in political processes,"" she said."
Cause_Specific	Late on Wednesday, NSGK announced key findings and conclusions of its long-awaited probe into unlawful influence of business groups on political processes in Lithuania.
Cause_Specific	The key findings in the 48-page document are based on information provided by the country's State Security Department.
Cause_Specific	NSGK found out that large business groups tried to influence politicians, authorities and top decision-makers during the last ten years to benefit from major energy projects and public procurement.
Cause_Specific	The probe focused on activities of MG Baltic and Vilniaus prekyba, the country's two largest business groups, as well as representatives of Rosatom, Russia's State Atomic Energy Corporation, on influencing dismantle of Lithuania's nuclear power plant in Ignalina and the country's efforts to achieve energy independence.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We have to stop these people and cut that kind of operations,"" the head of NSGK Vytautas Bakas commented on the findings of the probe to local media."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We have to look at this from the perspective of national security, and if their activities are considered as contradictory to interests of national security, they have to be banned from strategic sectors,"" said Bakas."
Distant_Evaluation	"MG Baltic called the conclusions of the Committee ""a political farce and nothing more""."
Distant_Evaluation	"""These so called conclusions are a selective, politically motivated mix of rumors."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Because of this process the entire business environment in Lithuania will suffer negative consequences,"" MG Baltic said in a statement."
Distant_Evaluation	Vilniaus prekyba said the conclusions are false.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Vilniaus prekyba suffers huge damage to its reputation,"" the company told local media."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	NSGK also concluded that there should be new investigations into the country's previous energy projects which involved state cooperation with private companies.
Cause_General	The Committee also provided proposals on preventing influence of business groups on political processes, media regulation, and improving political parties' financial accountability.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	NSGK also proposed to establish the institution of intelligence ombudsman to help ensure better control of security services.
Distant_Evaluation	Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis says he backs the idea.
Distant_Evaluation	Opposition parties questioned the impartiality of the Committee's probe.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The results of the probe leave an impression of selectiveness and fragmentation,"" the head of the largest opposition party Homeland Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats Gabrielius Landsbergis said on Thursday in a statement."
Cause_General	He noted the probe didn't look into Agrokoncernas, the country's major fertilizer trading and agri-business company, tied to the leader of the country's ruling Peasants and Greens Union Ramunas Karbauskis.

Main	PHNOM PENH, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia is reviewing its law in order to allow banned opposition politicians to return to politics, the government said in a statement on Monday.
Cause_Specific	"A total of 118 former Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) senior leaders have been barred from joining politics for five years since November 2017 after the CNRP was dissolved by the Supreme Court following the arrest of party leader Kem Sokha over ""treason"" charges."
Distant_Historical	The Phnom Penh Municipal Court granted bail to Sokha in September, allowing him to be transferred from the prison to his house in Phnom Penh on health reasons.
Cause_General	However, the 65-year-old former opposition leader was put under court surveillance with some conditions.
Main	"""In order to further promote democracy and the rule of law, the National Assembly is reviewing legal provisions to enable individuals who were banned from politics to resume their political activities,"" the statement said."
Distant_Evaluation	It once again defended the July 29 general election that saw the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) of Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen won all 125 National Assembly seats.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The election of the sixth legislature of the National Assembly on 29 July 2018 was conducted in a free, fair, peaceful and transparent manner,"" the statement said."

Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Opposition among Americans to Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, has increased in the wake of his testimony last week before a U.S. Senate committee in which he defiantly denied sexual misconduct allegations, Reuters/Ipsos polling data showed on Wednesday.

Cause_Specific	In the latest seven-day average in a survey of U.S. adults, 41 percent of respondents opposed Kavanaugh, 33 percent supported the conservative federal appeals court judge and 26 percent said they did not know.
Cause_General	Opposition to Kavanaugh grew 4 percentage points after the Sept. 27 Judiciary Committee hearing in which university professor Christine Blasey Ford detailed a sexual assault allegation against Kavanaugh and he denied it, portraying himself as the victim of a “political hit.”
Cause_General	Opposition grew every day after the hearing in the poll, conducted between Sept. 25 and Oct. 1.
Distant_Evaluation	The increase in opposition to Kavanaugh, facing a confirmation vote in the Senate after being nominated by Trump for a lifetime position on the court, appears to be driven by those who previously did not have an opinion.
Cause_General	The percentage of respondents with no opinion on Kavanaugh decreased by about 7 percentage points compared to a week before the hearing.
Cause_General	Support for Kavanaugh has remained relatively stable, the polling showed, rising slightly after the hearing.
Cause_General	Opposition rose among Democrats by 6 percentage points to 71 percent and was relatively unchanged among people unaffiliated with a political party compared to before the hearing, according to the poll.
Cause_General	Support among Republicans stood at 70 percent, rising 4 percentage points in the days after the hearing, but was lower among Republican women, at 64 percent.
Cause_General	Among independents and people unaffiliated with a political party, 31 percent opposed Kavanaugh, 20 percent supported him and 49 percent said they did not know.
Cause_General	The fight over Kavanaugh’s nomination comes against the backdrop of the #MeToo movement fighting sexual harassment and assault that has toppled a succession of powerful men.
Cause_General	The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English.
Cause_General	It gathered responses from 4,057 U.S. adults, including 1,347 Republicans and 1,653 Democrats.
Cause_General	It has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 2 percentage points
Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.
Main	Senator John McCain, a former prisoner of war in Vietnam who ran for president in 2008 as a maverick Republican and became a prominent critic of President Donald Trump, died on Saturday.
Cause_General	He was 81.
Cause_General	A senator from Arizona for more than three decades, McCain had been suffering from brain cancer since July 2017 and had not been at the U.S. Capitol this year.
Main	He died on Saturday afternoon at his ranch in Arizona with his wife, Cindy, and other family members at his bedside.
Cause_General	McCain frequently battled with Trump and his family has said he did not want the president to attend his funeral.
Cause_General	Flags flew at half-staff at the White House on Sunday.
Distant_Evaluation	Trump has tweeted his “deepest sympathies and respect” to McCain’s family, although he added no words of praise for McCain himself
Cause_General	All five living former presidents - Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W.
Cause_General	Bush and Jimmy Carter - paid tribute to McCain’s courage and character.
Distant_Evaluation	Cindy McCain said her husband had “passed the way he lived, on his own terms, surrounded by the people he loved, in the place he loved best.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	McCain will lie in state in the Arizona Capitol on Wednesday and in the U.S. Capitol in Washington on Friday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There will be a memorial service at the Washington National Cathedral on Saturday, with U.S. and international leaders invited to attend, and McCain will then be buried in a private ceremony at the U.S.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, on Sunday.
Distant_Evaluation	AFFABLE, CANTANKEROUS
Main_Consequence	McCain’s death brings to 50 the number of Republican-held seats in the 100-member U.S. Senate, with Democrats controlling 49.
Main_Consequence	Republican Arizona Governor Doug Ducey will appoint a member of his own party to succeed McCain after the funeral.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That could also give Republicans a slight edge in the battle to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court because McCain had been too ill to vote this year.
Distant_Evaluation	Alternatively affable and cantankerous, McCain had been in the public eye since the 1960s when, as a naval aviator, he was shot down during the Vietnam War and tortured by his North Vietnamese Communist captors.
Distant_Historical	He was edged out by George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 but became his party’s White House candidate eight years later.
Distant_Historical	After gambling on political neophyte Sarah Palin as his running mate, McCain lost to Obama, who became the first black U.S. president.
Distant_Evaluation	Obama said in a statement that he and McCain, despite their different backgrounds and political views, shared a belief in American ideals.
Distant_Evaluation	“We saw our political battles, even, as a privilege, something noble, an opportunity to serve as stewards of those high ideals at home, and to advance them around the world,” Obama wrote.
Distant_Evaluation	McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, was a frequent critic and target of his fellow Republican Trump, who was elected president in November 2016.
Distant_Evaluation	McCain denounced Trump for, among other things, his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and other leaders the senator described as foreign “tyrants.”
Distant_Historical	“Flattery secures his friendship, criticism his enmity,” McCain said of Trump in his memoir, “The Restless Wave,” which was released in May.
Distant_Evaluation	McCain castigated Trump in July for his summit with Putin, calling their joint news conference in Helsinki “one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president in memory.”
Distant_Evaluation	Defense Secretary James Mattis saluted McCain as a figure who “always put service to the nation before self.”
Distant_Evaluation	In Germany, whose government has clashed with Trump over a range of issues including trade and defense, Chancellor Angela Merkel said: “John McCain was guided by the firm conviction that the value of all political work could be found in serving freedom, democracy and the rule of law.”
Distant_Evaluation	French President Emmanuel Macron called McCain “a true American hero (whose) ... voice will be missed” and British Prime Minister Theresa May said he “embodied the idea of service over self.”
Distant_Historical	THUMBS-DOWN
Distant_Evaluation	McCain, a traditionally Republican foreign policy hawk, was admired in both parties for championing civility and compromise during an era of acrid partisanship in U.S. politics.
Distant_Evaluation	But he also had a famous temper and rarely shied away from a fight, including several with Trump.
Distant_Historical	He was the central figure in one of the most dramatic congressional moments in Trump’s presidency when he returned to Washington shortly after his brain cancer diagnosis for a middle-of-the-night vote in July 2017.
Distant_Historical	Still bearing a black eye and scar from surgery, McCain gave a thumbs-down signal in a vote to scuttle a Trump-backed bill that would have repealed the Obamacare healthcare law and increased the number of Americans without health insurance by millions.
Distant_Historical	Trump was furious about McCain’s vote and frequently referred to it at rallies.
Distant_Historical	After Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015, McCain condemned his hardline rhetoric on illegal immigration and said Trump had “fired up the crazies.” Trump retorted that McCain was “not a war hero,” adding: “I like people who weren’t captured.”

Distant_Historical	MCCAIN VERSUS OBAMA
Distant_Historical	McCain, the son and grandson of U.S. Navy admirals, was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1982 after more than two decades of Navy service.
Distant_Historical	Arizona next elected him to the U.S. Senate in 1986 to replace Barry Goldwater, the 1964 Republican presidential nominee revered by conservatives.
Distant_Historical	In running for president in 2008, McCain tried to succeed fellow Republican Bush at time when the United States was mired in wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and stuck in a financial crisis.
Distant_Historical	It was a stark contrast between McCain, then a 72-year-old veteran of Washington, and the 47-year-old Obama, who was offering a “Yes, we can” message of change.
Distant_Historical	McCain tried to inject some youth into his campaign with his selection of Palin, Alaska’s governor, as his running mate.
Distant_Historical	But her political inexperience and shaky interview performances raised concerns about her qualifications.
Distant_Evaluation	McCain voiced regret in his new memoir for not choosing then-Senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat turned independent, as his running mate.
Distant_Historical	WAR INJURIES
Distant_Historical	McCain flew attack planes off aircraft carriers during the Vietnam War.
Distant_Historical	In October 1967, his A-4 Skyhawk was shot down on a bombing mission over North Vietnam’s capital and he suffered two broken arms and a broken leg.
Distant_Historical	A mob dragged him from a lake, broke his shoulder and stabbed him.
Distant_Historical	Held at the notorious “Hanoi Hilton” prison and other sites, McCain was beaten and tortured, suffering broken bones and dysentery.
Distant_Historical	He was released on March 14, 1973, but left with permanent infirmities.
Cause_General	Several U.S. citizens living in Vietnam adorned a monument erected at the site of the plane crash with flowers on Sunday in tribute.
Distant_Evaluation	“Not only did Senator McCain actively contribute to Vietnam-U.S. ties, he was a friend of Vietnam who won huge love from Vietnamese people at many levels,” Vietnam’s ambassador to the United States, Ha Kim Ngoc, told the state-run Voice of Vietnam radio service.
Distant_Evaluation	In Congress, McCain prided himself on his history of working across party lines on immigration, climate change and campaign finance reform.
Distant_Historical	He supported Bush’s 2003 invasion of Iraq but also spoke out against the Bush administration’s use of waterboarding, a type of simulated drowning widely considered torture, and other extreme interrogation tactics in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Distant_Historical	McCain was born on Aug. 29, 1936, at an American naval installation in the Panama Canal Zone - U.S. territory at the time - where his father was stationed.

Distant_Historical	McCain divorced his wife Carol after 15 years of marriage in 1980 and weeks later married the then Cindy Henley, daughter of a wealthy beer distributor in Arizona.
Distant_Historical	A dark period for McCain came as one of the “Keating Five” group of senators accused of improperly intervening with federal regulators to help political contributor and bank executive Charles Keating, whose Lincoln Savings and Loan failed in 1989, costing taxpayers $3.4 billion.
Distant_Historical	McCain was cleared of wrongdoing in 1991 but the Senate Ethics Committee rebuked him for poor judgment.
Distant_Historical	On July 25, 2017, McCain delivered a Senate floor speech not long after his cancer diagnosis that was widely seen as his farewell address.
Distant_Historical	It called on fellow Republicans to stand up to Trump and for all lawmakers to work together to keep America as a “beacon of liberty” in the world.

Main	Demand for commercial airtime is particularly strong ahead of elections for one third of the U.S. Senate seats, and all 435 House of Representatives seats as well as positions such as state governorships, because U.S. President Donald Trump’s Republican party is fighting to keep its majority in both houses of Congress while Democrats are battling to turn the tables.
Cause_General	Politicians and their supporters from both political parties are looking to win voters with their stances on hot button issues such as gun control and abortion rights.
Distant_Evaluation	“There’s a lot of excitement and probably a lot of paranoia and a lot of fear, and those things drive political dollars,” Kevin Latek, chief legal and development officer at Gray Television, told investors on Tuesday, according to a conference call transcript.
Cause_General	Gray posted second-quarter political ad revenue of $18.1 million, 20 percent above the high end of its forecast and 9 percent above the same quarter in 2014, the last mid-term election year.
Cause_Specific	Political ads brought about 7 percent of total second-quarter revenue at Gray, which forecast a third-quarter range of $41 million to $45 million for the segment versus $41 million in 2014.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	After reporting bumper second-quarter political revenue on Wednesday, Sinclair raised its 2018 target for the segment to $160 million from a range of $140 million to $150 million.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The new target would be 5.8 percent of total revenue, according to analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters data.
Distant_Evaluation	Of course the momentum could change as 80 percent of political ad spending typically occurs between the start of September and election day, which is Nov. 6 this year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But analysts are hopeful the early strength will continue.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“It looks like its going to be a record year even without a Presidential race,” said Daniel Kurnos an analyst covering broadcasters at Benchmark Company.
Distant_Historical	For 2018, political advertising could generate $2.4 billion revenue for local broadcasters compared with $2.1 billion in 2014, according to Kantar Media CMAG unit’s latest forecast issued in 2017.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Steven Passwaiter, vice president and general manager at CMAG, said he aims to update the estimate this month.
Distant_Historical	The 2016 U.S. presidential election generated $2.85 billion for local broadcasters, according to Passwaiter.
Distant_Historical	The presidential race tends to attract more advertising dollars than local mid-term battles but 2016 spending was much weaker than expected as Trump relied far more on free media than past candidates.
Error	(reut.rs/2M8IPNw)
Distant_Evaluation	That disappointment, which pummeled broadcasters shares in 2016, is fuelling hopes that forecasts are more solid this year.
Distant_Evaluation	“Everybody got burned two years ago because the presidential spend turned out to be a dud.
Distant_Evaluation	I think these guys are going to be incredibly careful not to raise expectations to disappoint the street again,” said Passwaiter.
Cause_General	Gray Television shares rose 14.8 percent in the two sessions after its Aug. 7 quarterly report.
Distant_Historical	In 2016, the stock fell 24.7 percent from June to October.
Cause_General	Sinclair’s shares rose 4 percent on Wednesday after its report, although enthusiasm was dampened by the collapse of its effort to buy Tribune Media (TRCO.N).Sinclair stock fell 20.6 percent from June to October in 2016.
Cause_General	Another local broadcaster E.W.
Cause_General	Scripps (SSP.O), rose 5.7 percent after it reported results on Aug. 3 including political ad revenue of $14.9 million, compared with $7 million pro forma political revenue in the 2014 quarter.
Cause_General	Political brought 5.3 percent of its total second-quarter revenue.
Distant_Evaluation	Investors are careful about making bets on political revenue for broadcasters as it only shows up every two years, before elections and is unpredictable.
Distant_Evaluation	The amount a broadcaster generates varies a lot in election years as it depends on how many of their stations serve battleground states where campaigns spend heavily in a particular year for reasons such as close polls.
Distant_Evaluation	Also, strong demand for political commercials tends to eat into core advertising revenue from clients like carmakers as broadcasters only have a finite number of timeslots, said Leo Kulp, analyst at RBC Capital Management.
Distant_Evaluation	But even if broadcasters can’t bank on future political windfalls, a strong season is still a big positive, according to Kulp.
Distant_Evaluation	“What it does is help generate incremental free cash flow.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It’s going to translate to the companies deleveraging more and giving them more capacity to do M&A,” he said.
Cause_Specific	SEOUL (Reuters) - When North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed in June to help return the remains of American troops killed in the 1950-53 Korean War, it was seen as one of the more attainable goals to come out of his summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Main	American officials expect North Korea to hand over around 50 sets of remains in coming days or weeks, but the drawn-out process of negotiations to get to this point highlights the complications involved in the issue.
Main	At the heart of the difficulty, former officials involved in previous recovery missions say, are likely demands from North Korea for cash compensation, as well as the unsolved tensions over North’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile arsenal.
Cause_General	More than 7,700 U.S. troops who fought in the Korean War remain unaccounted for, with about 5,300 of those lost in what is now North Korea, according to the Defence POW/MIA Accounting Agency (DPAA), the U.S. military agency tasked with tracking down prisoners of war and troops missing in action.
Cause_General	The Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty, leaving the United States and North Korea still technically at war.
Cause_General	Soon after the June summit, Trump announced North Korea had returned the remains of 200 soldiers that had already been found, but this has yet to take place and negotiations over the actual handing over of the remains have dragged on.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Trump told an audience of veterans on Tuesday that he hoped “fallen warriors” would begin to come home “very soon.”
Distant_Evaluation	Bill Richardson, a former U.S. diplomat with experience negotiating with North Korea, including during the recovery of the remains of seven Americans in 2007, said Pyongyang was using the issue as “a bargaining chip”.
Distant_Evaluation	“They’re stalling,” he told Reuters.
Main	“I think in the end the North Koreans will turn over the majority of the remains that they have - but it will have a price.
Main	Not just a financial price.”
Distant_Historical	REMAINS RETURNED
Distant_Historical	Between the 1990s and 2005, more than 400 caskets of remains found in North Korea were returned to the United States, and the bodies of some 330 Americans were accounted for, according to the DPAA.
Distant_Historical	Decades-old remains that North Korea has handed over in the past have not always been identifiable as U.S. troops.
Distant_Historical	The U.S. and North Korea worked together on so-called joint field activities (JFAs) to recover remains from 1996-2005, until Washington halted operations, expressing concerns about the safety of its personnel.
Distant_Historical	A Congressional Research Service (CRS) report said the United States paid $28 million to North Korea for assistance in the effort.
Distant_Evaluation	“To the best of my knowledge, it was never based on a per body calculation.
Distant_Evaluation	Payments were made in support of each field mission – each joint recovery operation,” said Frank Jannuzi, a former Democratic Senate Foreign Relations Committee staffer focusing on East Asian and Pacific affairs.
Distant_Evaluation	Payments were to compensate North Korea for direct expenses incurred such as fuel costs, disruption of agricultural planting, or equipment costs, he said.
Distant_Historical	In 2011, President Barack Obama’s administration agreed with Pyongyang to restart recovery missions, offering to pay $5,669,160 in “compensation” for services provided by North Korea.
Distant_Historical	Those planned missions never happened, however, as Washington called off the deal after North Korea tested a rocket in early 2012, said Paul Cole, author of “POW/MIA Accounting.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If the past is any indicator, the (North Koreans) are demanding up-front deliveries of food, fuel and at least $5 million in cash,” Cole told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	“In the era of ‘maximum pressure,’ the dilemma for the Trump administration is whether to give the (North Koreans) massive amounts of food, fuel, trucks, SUVs and millions in cash, or cancel the deal.”
Distant_Evaluation	Former officials say typically North Korea has not asked for compensation when it unilaterally returns remains it recovers, such as the roughly 200 currently being discussed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But if the United States hopes to send its own teams into North Korea, there will likely be a cost.
Distant_Evaluation	Asked whether the cost of future joint field activities would be similar to what was paid in the past, the Pentagon’s DPAA Public Affairs Office said: “As of yet, there are no JFAs scheduled in North Korea so we cannot speculate on what such activities may cost.”
Cause_Specific	The U.S. State Department did not have an immediate comment on the negotiations, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week North Korea had committed to return the first remains “in the next couple of weeks.” [nL1N1UE1A3]
Distant_Historical	According to CRS, the United States also paid for recovery operations in Vietnam.
Distant_Evaluation	As with North Korea, critics complained the Vietnamese government charged “extraordinarily high fees for providing support ... and that the services received are by no means as lavish as the bills presented indicate”.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	South Korea’s former vice minister of foreign affairs and trade, Kim Sung-han, said Pyongyang would likely want to use the return of remains to improve its relations with Washington, while avoiding addressing more touchy subjects such as denuclearization.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“North Korea wants the war declared ended sooner rather than later, so trust can be built and progress on its international standing can be made,” he said, adding that any “reimbursements” were likely to violate sanctions.
Distant_Evaluation	Besides being politically sensitive, however, handing the North Korean government stacks of cash offers no guarantee that authenticated U.S. servicemen’s remains would be recovered, Jannuzi said.
Distant_Evaluation	“We might spend a million dollars and come up with nothing.”
Main	GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala deployed members of the feared Kaibil special forces unit on Wednesday to stop protesters from interrupting a session of parliament, triggering anger among opposition leaders who say President Jimmy Morales is using the military to cow critics.

Cause_General	The deployment of thousands of police and soldiers was the latest example of Morales resorting to displays of military strength since he announced the shuttering of a U.N.-backed anti-graft commission late last month.
Main_Consequence	That move, and his subsequent barring from Guatemala of the head of the commission, have triggered global criticism and mounting street protests across the Central American nation.
Distant_Evaluation	Many Guatemalans have been sensitive to the use of military for internal security and political purposes since the country’s 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996, and successive military governments in the 1970s and 1980s.
Distant_Evaluation	“There is free expression of thought in Guatemala ... but freedom does not mean to hit, abuse, break or stain,” Morales said to applause from his allies in a speech to mark Independence Day in Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	“I repeat my call for peace, for unity,” he said, as Kaibil soldiers in red berets bearing semi-automatic weapons formed a cordon around the building.
Cause_Specific	In a statement, the army said the deployments were normal measures for presidential security.
Main_Consequence	The heavy security presence, which also involved more than 2,000 police, prevented a large march from getting close to Congress, after protesters on Tuesday crowded lawmakers and shouted abuse to oppose a bill they say weakens independent institutions.
Cause_General	Guatemala celebrates independence from Spain on Sept. 15.
Cause_General	Created in the 1970s to fight a counter-insurgency campaign against Guatemala’s leftist guerrillas during the civil war, which left over 200,000 dead, the Kaibils were infamous for their brutality and involvement in an emblematic massacre.
Distant_Evaluation	“I decline to participate in the solemn session in parliament, because I cannot take part in an event with the unnecessary and intimidating presence of the army toward a population that has the legitimate right to protest,” the country’s Human Rights Ombudsman, Jordan Rodas, said on Twitter.
Distant_Evaluation	His sentiments were echoed by several opposition lawmakers who described the security measures as disproportionate for a peaceful protest.
Cause_General	The police and troops blocked off parts of the city center as farmers and students marched for a third day, carrying signs that said “No more corruption” and demanded the resignation of Morales.
Cause_General	Late last month, Morales said the country would not renew the mandate of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) that had brought down his predecessor and also tried to have Morales impeached.
Cause_General	The United Nations has expressed serious concerns about the decision.
Distant_Anecdotal	“We demand the president let the CICIG continue.
Distant_Anecdotal	We do not want more corruption,” said Cirilo Perez, a local indigenous leader who helped organize protests.
Cause_General	Demonstrators are also protesting two legislative initiatives that lawmakers who back Morales are aiming to pass in the coming days.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	One bill would limit the ability of investigators to strip politicians of their immunity from prosecution and another would permit almost 80 congressmen who have defected from the opposition to join Morales’ party.
Distant_Historical	Working with Guatemala’s attorney general, the CICIG in 2017 sought to prosecute Morales, a former comedian, over illegal financing allegations during his election campaign two years earlier.
Cause_General	Morales denies any wrongdoing and says the CICIG has overstepped its remit.

Cause_General	When Morales announced his decision not to renew CICIG’s mandate he was flanked by rows of soldiers.
Cause_General	U.S.-donated military vehicles appeared at the commission’s offices that day in a move criticized by U.S. lawmakers as a political statement.
Cause_General	CICIG has a year to exit the country.
Cause_General	Despite previous staunch support from the United States for the anti-corruption body, the State Department has not spoken strongly to back it this time.

Main	LONDON, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Theresa May will face a vote of no confidence Wednesday from Members of Parliament (MPs) in her own Conservative Party that could see her kicked out of her role as prime minister and the Party leader.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If that were to happen, May would still remain as prime minister until her successor had been chosen.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That could see May remaining in Downing Street into January, with important government business effectively put on hold, and most significantly no progress being made on any Brexit deal.
Cause_General	The vote of no confidence in May will be carried out by the so-called 1922 Committee, the representative group for Conservative MPs.
Cause_Specific	The vote was triggered early on Wednesday morning when the necessary quota of 48 letters from MPs asking for a leadership vote was reached, which represents 15 percent of Tory MPs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If May can win the support of 158 Tory MPs, 50 percent of MPs plus one, then she can stay as leader and as prime minister.
Cause_General	"""May only has to win a simple majority in this no confidence vote in order to stay as leader,"" constitutional expert Tim Bale, professor of politics at Queen Mary University London (QMUL), told Xinhua."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The rules of the leadership process state that the leader can face just one confidence vote in a year, so if May wins on Wednesday evening she will be immune from challenges until next December.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, if the vote is a close one May could feel that she is too politically damaged to continue, and she would step down as leader and prime minister.
Distant_Evaluation	"""You can win a confidence vote by one vote and stay in place, but I would suggest that that kind of majority would not be sufficient,"" Bale said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""It might be a technical win, but it would mean the Conservative Party leader is fatally wounded,"" he added."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If May is defeated, or if she steps down as a result of the vote, then the Conservative Party will immediately begin the process of choosing a leader, who will become the new prime minister.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The head of the 1922 Committee Graham Brady will agree a date for the first round of the leadership election with the prime minister.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Then, candidates for leader will come forward from among Conservative MPs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Each candidate needs just two other MPs to nominate them for the election.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This could see an initially large field of candidates running for leadership, and a series of votes will be held among Conservative MPs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In each round of the vote, the lowest polling leadership candidate will fall out of the race until there are just two left.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Both those candidates will then be put to a postal ballot by the entire membership of the Conservative Party across the whole of Great Britain.
Cause_General	Figures from March this year show that this electorate is about 124,000 strong.
Distant_Historical	May went through the initial parts of this process in the summer of 2016 when she was eventually chosen to replace outgoing David Cameron, who quit the morning after the June referendum set Britain on a path to leave the European Union (EU).
Distant_Historical	At that time, the initial rounds of voting among Conservative MPs to reduce the field to two candidates took 10 days, and a postal ballot of party members was not necessary as the other candidate in the election with May withdrew from the race.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The first part of the process, the voting rounds for MPs, could take the process up until just before Christmas.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With the disruption of holidays and to the postal system, it would not be possible to hold a ballot of the full party membership until the New Year.

Main	WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday said the U.S. full report over the death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi will come over the next two days.
Cause_General	On a trip to California, Trump told the media that he had talked with the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Gina Haspel, over the killing of Khashoggi.
Main	"Referring to the incident as ""a horrible thing"" and ""a very, very bad situation,"" Trump said ""we'll be having a very full report over the next two days, probably Monday or Tuesday."""
Cause_Specific	The CIA has concluded that the Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered to kill Khashoggi, U.S. media quoted insiders on Friday as saying.
Distant_Evaluation	"However, Trump said the CIA has not ""assessed anything yet."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""It's too early."
Distant_Evaluation	That was a very premature report.
Distant_Evaluation	"But that's possible -- we're going to see,"" he said."
Main	"""But we're going to have a report on Tuesday."
Distant_Evaluation	"And it'll be very complete."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We're going to come up with a report as to what we think the overall impact was and who caused it, and who did it,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	"On Friday, Trump said ""we also have a great ally in Saudi Arabia."
Distant_Evaluation	They give us a lot of jobs and a lot of business and economic development.
Distant_Evaluation	"They have been a truly spectacular ally in terms of jobs and economic development."""
Distant_Evaluation	Also on Friday, the State Department said the United States has not made a final conclusion on the death of Khashoggi.
Distant_Evaluation	"In a statement, spokesperson Heather Nauert said ""recent reports indicating that the U.S. government has made a final conclusion is inaccurate,"" and that ""there remain numerous unanswered questions with respect to the murder."""
Cause_General	"However, Nauert noted that the U.S. side will ""maintain strategic relationship"" with Saudi Arabia."
Cause_Specific	Khashoggi, a columnist for The Washington Post, has been missing since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Cause_Specific	"The Saudi authorities said that Khashoggi died in a ""brawl"" in its consulate."
Cause_Specific	After releasing the results of its initial investigations, the Saudi Public Prosecution announced that 18 people were arrested over their alleged connections with the killing.
Cause_General	The U.S. Congress has urged a thorough investigation in the murder of Khashoggi, and threatened to take more actions against Saudi Arabia if those responsible were not held accountable, such as suspending the U.S. military sales to Saudi Arabia and sanctioning the kingdom.
Cause_Specific	On Thursday, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on 17 individuals over their alleged roles in the killing of Khashoggi.
Distant_Evaluation	The parallels are striking: bold new Congressional majorities swept into power by public dissatisfaction with White House policies.
Cause_General	The administration and Congress digging in for a test of wills over federal spending.
Distant_Evaluation	A watershed presidential election looming.
Distant_Evaluation	Memories of the rancorous 1995 budget fight between President Clinton and leaders of the Republican revolution are casting a distinct shadow over the current impasse between President Bush and Congressional Democrats on Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	Each side believes it can apply lessons learned from that earlier battle to its strategy in the current showdown.
Distant_Historical	The 1995 budget fight grew out of the push by Republicans -- riding their historic House takeover the year before -- for cuts in federal spending, with Medicare as their poster child for a bloated federal program.
Distant_Historical	When Mr. Clinton refused to go along with trimming the program, budget talks collapsed, and the resulting 21-day shutdown put nearly 300,000 federal workers on furlough and disrupted public services.
Distant_Historical	Republicans were outmaneuvered in that battle, and found that the public blamed them for a shutdown of federal agencies.
Main	Today, they stand behind the executive branch, with 150 Republican House members promising Mr. Bush they would sustain his veto of a war spending measure that sets a timeline for leaving Iraq.
Main	Democrats, who sided with the president in 1995, are the ones challenging the White House now, bolstered by public sentiment against the war.
Distant_Evaluation	Even as those in the middle of the current clash strategize about the next move, some figures central to the past fight say the differences are more pronounced than the similarities.
Distant_Evaluation	''There were no Americans risking their lives at the Washington monument in 1995,'' said Newt Gingrich, the Republican speaker at the time whom critics accused of badly overplaying his hand.
Distant_Evaluation	''There were no Americans being shot at the Interior Department in 1995,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''We were engaged in a domestic political debate over being serious over a balanced budget.
Distant_Evaluation	The Democrats risk sending signals to our enemies that kidnapping British sailors and killing young Americans is acceptable.''
Distant_Evaluation	Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader in 1995, sees differences as well, but believes they play to Democratic strengths, with Mr. Bush defending an unpopular war and Democrats treading more carefully than did Mr. Gingrich and his coterie.
Distant_Evaluation	''Newt Gingrich boasted of shutting the government down,'' recalled Mr. Daschle.
Distant_Evaluation	''He was proud of the fact he was doing that just to show his will.
Distant_Evaluation	Republicans felt they had a mandate and could do what they wanted.
Distant_Evaluation	I don't think you could find a Democrat who thinks they have a mandate, but we do have a chance.''
Distant_Historical	Almost from the beginning of the budget fight in 1995, Mr. Clinton's poll numbers edged up and those of Mr. Gingrich, the Republican speaker of the House, dipped as the public perceived the president as the one trying to resolve the problem and Republicans as inflexible.
Distant_Evaluation	One difference with 1995 was that in that episode, there was tangible fallout for Americans as parks and museums closed, benefit checks were delayed and an array of federal assistance was suspended.
Cause_General	Today, the administration is making the case that the military will be denied resources, and some tours in Iraq might have to be extended if no bill is approved.
Cause_General	But the Pentagon appears to have the flexibility to pay for operations at least through May and possibly longer with substantial juggling.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Nevertheless, any event detrimental to the troops that could be tied to the impasse could cause a backlash for Democrats.
Distant_Evaluation	Republicans say they continue to believe that much of the public still regards the president as the nation's pre-eminent leader and that Congress should not meddle in White House business too deeply.
Distant_Evaluation	''With us it was a bridge too far,'' said Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, recalling the duel with Mr. Clinton.
Distant_Evaluation	''Tactically, we made a mistake and found the American people still liked the office of the presidency having some dominance.
Distant_Evaluation	This is the Democrats' government shutdown.''
Distant_Evaluation	But Democrats say that Mr. Bush is operating in an atmosphere of deep skepticism and that he must fight his own low poll numbers as well as public frustration with the war -- even though a recent survey showed a slight gain in optimism about Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	''We have had a chance to study 1995, and Democrats are bound and determined to make sure it won't happen to them,'' said Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader.
Distant_Evaluation	''Here we have a president seriously at odds with the American people.''
Distant_Evaluation	Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the current chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and a senior aide in the Clinton administration, said Mr. Bush was retracing the missteps of Mr. Gingrich, courting conflict, while Mr. Clinton displayed a willingness to compromise.
Distant_Evaluation	''President Clinton started off with, 'Come on, let's talk, let's negotiate,' '' said Mr. Emanuel.
Distant_Evaluation	''President Bush has started off with confrontation.''
Distant_Evaluation	Indeed, the White House has drawn a hard line, saying it will not legitimize a Democratic withdrawal plan of any sort by accepting it as part of legislation.
Distant_Evaluation	Two Democrats said that Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, urged Mr. Bush to work with Democrats on the war while the two mingled in her office before a Capitol Rotunda ceremony last week; the Democrats said that Mr. Bush's reply was essentially, ''I am where I am.''
Cause_General	Both sides are trying to exploit openings.
Cause_General	Republicans, aware of Mr. Bush's low standing, point to the added domestic spending in the House and Senate bills, trying to build resentment to pork-barrel projects.
Cause_General	The White House is employing its presidential megaphone, particularly with Congress out of town for Easter.
Cause_General	Mr. Bush took to the Rose Garden on Tuesday to warn of ''significant consequences for our men and women in the armed forces.''
Cause_General	Democrats immediately fired back, accusing the president of being out of touch with the public and calling on him to negotiate.
Distant_Evaluation	''I saw a lot of what happened when my husband had a Republican Congress,'' said Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, as she toured Iowa as part of her presidential campaign.
Distant_Evaluation	''We would stake out one position, they would stake out one position.
Distant_Evaluation	And then people would begin to try to figure out how to narrow the difference.
Distant_Evaluation	That's what should be happening here.''
Distant_Evaluation	It is difficult to predict who will prevail.
Distant_Evaluation	After all, no one foresaw in the fall of 1995 that a simple legislative dispute would end up stalling the momentum of a determined new majority and enhancing the standing of an embattled president.

Error	U.S. President Donald Trump speaks to reporters before leaving for the G20 Summit in Argentina from the White House in Washington D.C., the United States, on Nov. 29, 2018.
Error	(Xinhua/Ting Shen)
Main	MOSCOW, Nov. 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia expressed disappointment at U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to cancel his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Argentina, saying that the move was a result of U.S. internal politics and lack of an agenda.
Main	"""We regret the U.S. administration's decision ..."
Main	"It meant the presidents' discussion on serious issues on the international and bilateral agenda has been postponed indefinitely,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday."
Distant_Evaluation	"On Thursday, Trump tweeted that considering the unsolved Russia-Ukraine confrontation, it would be ""best"" to cancel his meeting with Putin, which was previously scheduled for Dec. 1 on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) summit."
Cause_Specific	Russia on Sunday seized near the Kerch Strait three Ukrainian naval ships that allegedly breached the Russian border, although Kiev denied the allegations.
Distant_Evaluation	"The White House reiterated Friday that the reason for cancelling meeting was Ukraine, adding that the ongoing Russia probe ""probably does undermine"" the U.S. relationship with Russia."
Distant_Evaluation	Despite Washington's repeated citing of the Kerch Strait incident, Russian experts believed that Trump used the tensions between Russia and Ukraine as a pretext for canceling the talks.
Distant_Evaluation	"""If one really decided to come to an agreement on something, this incident could not have prevented the meeting,"" Russian political scientist Mikhail Sinelnikov-Orishak told Xinhua."
Distant_Evaluation	Russian experts were skeptical about the meeting from the very beginning.
Distant_Evaluation	No breakthroughs were expected due to U.S. internal politics.
Distant_Evaluation	The fundamental difference between Russia and the United States in approaches to solving regional problems, such as the Syrian and Ukrainian issues, is another reason behind aborting the meeting.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""A meeting between Trump and Putin is only possible with prior coordination of positions and an agenda, which will allow discussing various kinds of issues and finding points of contact,"" said Nikita Danyu, deputy director of the Institute for Strategic Studies and Forecasts of Russia's RUDN University."
Distant_Evaluation	He noted that the only topic that could bring together the two leaders is global security, which includes Washington's plans to withdraw from arms control treaties.
Distant_Evaluation	However, the Trump administration has little interest in these issues, according to Pavel Zolotaryov, head of the Military and Political Research section of the Moscow-based Institute for United States and Canada Studies.
Distant_Evaluation	"""U.S. President's National Security Affairs Assistant John Bolton is also not very inclined to deal with this problem, maybe only in the sense of getting rid of these treaties."
Distant_Evaluation	"He believes that the U.S. has no need of them,"" Zolotaryov said."
Distant_Evaluation	Despite disappointment, Putin is ready for dialogue with his U.S. counterpart, Peskov said Friday.

Error	German Chancellor Angela Merkel attends a press conference at the headquarters of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Berlin, capital of Germany, on Oct. 29, 2018.
Error	German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Monday that she would not run for another term as chancellor in 2021 when the current term ends.
Error	(Xinhua/Lian zhen)
Error	By Ren Ke, Zhang Yuan
Main	BERLIN, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- Angela Merkel, the veteran German Chancellor and crisis manager, on Monday announced her withdrawal from political career after the chancellorship term ends.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The 64-year-old Merkel told a press conference at the headquarters of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) that she will remain as chancellor for the remainder of the legislature, which started this March and will end in 2021.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In addition, she announced that she will not run again for CDU leadership at the party's next federal conference in Hamburg in December.
Distant_Evaluation	In general, a CDU chancellor is at the same time leader of the party in a bid to govern easily, and Merkel also said before the two positions should belong in one hand.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It's time to open a new chapter!"""
Distant_Evaluation	said Merkel at the press conference.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	She added that she will not take any other political positions after the chancellorship term ends, dispelling some reports that she will serve in Brussels.
Cause_General	Merkel has informed her decision to Horst Seehofer, leader of Christian Social Union (CSU) and Andrea Nahles, chairwoman of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD), the two parties in the current German federal coalition government.
Cause_General	Merkel is CDU chairwoman since April 2000 and German Chancellor since November 2005.
Distant_Historical	On March 14 this year she was sworn in for the fourth term as Chancellor in German federal parliament.
Cause_General	She successfully led the country to withstand the 2007/2008 international financial crisis, and led the EU out of a Eurozone debt crisis, winning worldwide prestige of her leadership.
Distant_Evaluation	Her leadership, however, began to wither since the 2015 European refugee crisis, when she welcomed over one million refugees to enter Germany, triggering the rise of right-populist politics and the fragmentation of the country's party politics.
Distant_Historical	Merkel's Christian Democrats suffered a significant drop in 2017 September federal elections, but she could not help win back voters lost as she promised.
Cause_General	Instead, the Merkel-led coalition government was stuck into quarrels over migration policy, an issue called as Merkel's Achilles Heel.
Cause_General	Her announcement of initiating political withdrawal came after the state election in Hesse on Sunday, in which the CDU's votes decreased by more than 10 percent compared to the last election five years ago, while the environmentalist Green Party became the greatest winner and the right-populist Alternative fuer Deutschland (AfD) has successfully crossed the 5-percent threshold and entered all state parliaments in Germany.
Cause_General	The setback in Hesse followed the similar one earlier this month that CSU, CDU's Bavaria-only ally, lost absolute majority in the state election.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The image given by the government is unacceptable...As chancellor and the chairwoman of the CDU, I carry the responsibility both for the successes and for the failures,"" Merkel told the press conference, describing the results in Hesse as bitter and disappointing."
Distant_Evaluation	"""I am convinced that we have to stop,"" said Merkel, referring to the state elections in Hesse."
Distant_Evaluation	"""And I wish that we take yesterday's election day as a break, that we put everything to the test, which we have said and done since the election of the Bundestag until today."""
Cause_General	Merkel also confirmed the candidacy for the new CDU party leadership, including the party's secretary-general Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer and German Federal Health Minister Jens Spahn.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""I want my party gets the freedom to prepare well for the future,"" said Merkel."
Distant_Evaluation	Merkel's renunciation as CDU leader put the coalition government at risk.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A Merkel loyalist and successor like Kramp-Karrenbauer will probably last longer, while a CDU leader like Spahn, a Merkel critic, will bring more uncertainties.
Distant_Evaluation	SPD chairwoman Andrea Nahles said she saw no direct effects on the coalition government.
Distant_Evaluation	"She said Merkel has done an ""extraordinary"" job at the helm of the CDU, steering it out of deep crises."
Distant_Evaluation	Nahles said Merkel not only withstood criticism but also reorganized the content of the CDU and established a new style of leadership.
Distant_Evaluation	The CSU chairman Seehofer regretted the Merkel's renunciation as CDU chairwoman.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It's a pity,"" Seehofer was quoted by DPA, ""We have had some discussions, but it has always been a trusting, mutually respectful cooperation...And in that respect, I think it's a shame that this caesura should take place."""
Distant_Evaluation	The Greens' leader Annalena Baerbock praised that Merkel has opened the party for a modern image of society.
Distant_Evaluation	The Free Democratic Party (FDP) leader Christian Lindner, however, said at a press conference on Monday that Merkel gave up the wrong office, but the chancellorship.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"AfD leader Joerg Meuthen said that Merkel's decision to give up the CDU chairmanship was ""good news,"" saying that he expected her to ""give up her chancellorship soon."""
Cause_General	LIMA (Reuters) - Until this week, Martin Vizcarra led a quiet life as Peru’s ambassador to Canada, overseeing the two nations’ friendly relations from Ottawa, the Canadian capital.

Main	But Vizcarra also happened to be Peru’s first vice president, and he will now swap stately dinners with diplomats for the scorched earth of Peru’s presidency, after Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned this week under the pressure of graft allegations.
Main	Vizcarra, 55, was sworn in as president of the Andean nation of 32 million people on Friday, promising to fight corruption “at any cost” and calling on lawmakers to end the acrimonious disputes that accompanied Kuczynski’s downfall in one of region’s most stable economies.
Distant_Historical	A tall and lanky civil engineer married to a schoolteacher, Vizcarra plunged into politics after seeing his native Moquegua, a small mining region in southern Peru, languish under corrupt local leaders and neglect from policymakers in Lima, the capital.

Distant_Evaluation	“He makes decisions when he has to make them, and reflects a lot before doing so,” said Luis Marchese, the Peru manager for Anglo American Plc.
Distant_Evaluation	Marchese credits Vizcarra with defusing opposition that threatened to derail the company’s $3.3 billion proposed mine, Quellaveco.
Distant_Historical	After 20 months of negotiations led by Vizcarra, the company and community leaders reached a deal that modified the project’s water-use plan.
Distant_Evaluation	But Vizcarra now faces a much taller task.
Cause_General	Kuczynski’s epic battle with the opposition-controlled Congress and the far-reaching graft scandal over Odebrecht - a Brazilian builder that admitted to bribing officials in Peru for a decade - has sparked demands for new elections to purge a political class widely seen as corrupt.
Cause_General	“IN TOUCH WITH REALITY”
Cause_General	Vizcarra was in Quebec at a meet-and-greet with Peruvian expatriates on Wednesday when he heard that Kuczynski had resigned in the face of near-certain impeachment, a source close to Vizcarra said.
Cause_General	He arrived in Lima after police fired tear gas at protesters marching against the political establishment.
Distant_Evaluation	Vizcarra’s biggest asset might be his low profile.
Distant_Historical	He started to distance himself from the government last year as Kuczynski came under fire from the rightwing opposition party that controls Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	Unlike Kuczynski, a Princeton-trained former Wall Street banker, Vizcarra tends to watch the Sunday night news shows that often set the week’s agenda in Peru and is a more shrewd politician than he appears, the source said.
Distant_Historical	In September, Vizcarra left Peru, choosing to be ambassador to low-key Canada instead of the United States to learn more about mining in the developed world, the source said.
Distant_Evaluation	“I don’t know much about him,” Anderson Vasquez, a Lima office worker said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“But I’m hoping for the best.
Distant_Evaluation	Peru looks bad to the rest of the world, and we need to get on with things.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Kuczynski had promised to modernize Peru by the end of his scheduled term in 2021.
Distant_Evaluation	Instead, bombshell revelations that he had financial ties with Odebrecht - despite repeated denials - put him in the opposition’s crosshairs.

Distant_Historical	The two teamed up to launch an unlikely 2016 presidential ticket that combined Kuczynski’s experience in international finance with Vizcarra’s appeal as a Lima outsider.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But where Kuczynski is prone to gaffes and name dropping, Vizcarra’s more modest style may be welcome in a country used to more formality from its leaders.
Distant_Evaluation	“Vizcarra’s sensible and in touch with the reality of the country.
Distant_Evaluation	That’s the big difference” with Kuczynski, said Peruvian political analyst Diethell Columbus.
Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court begins its new term on Monday in an awkward position, down one justice as the fierce fight unfolds in the Senate over confirmation of President Donald Trump’s nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to a lifetime job as a justice.

Error	REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/File Photo
Main	With eight justices rather than the usual nine, the court was set to hear arguments in two cases as it opens its nine-month term, according to tradition, on the first Monday of October.
Cause_General	Justice Anthony Kennedy retired effective in July, leaving the court ideologically deadlocked with four conservatives and four liberals on the bench awaiting the outcome of the Kavanaugh battle.
Distant_Evaluation	Trump nominated the conservative federal appeals court judge in July but his confirmation in the Senate remained in doubt over sexual misconduct allegations that he denies.
Distant_Evaluation	Unlike prior years, when a series of major cases awaited the justices, there are no blockbusters yet on their calendar.
Cause_General	Their first argument on Monday is a property rights case involving protected habitat for a warty amphibian known as the dusky gopher frog.
Distant_Historical	The court’s previous term, which ended in June, included more 5-4 decisions than usual, with conservatives in the majority.
Distant_Historical	These rulings included approving Trump’s travel ban on people from several Muslim-majority nations, prohibiting a type of regulation of anti-abortion clinics, and banning certain public-sector union fees.
Distant_Evaluation	“After a term of challenging cases and issues, and an unusually high number of 5-4 decisions, as I see it, we needed our summer break,” Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joked to an audience last week.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	For the current term that runs through next June, the court does have some important cases, though none yet of the magnitude of the biggest from the previous term.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	One case over whether a state and the federal government can each prosecute a person for the same crime could impact Trump’s willingness to pardon people like Paul Manafort.
Cause_General	Trump’s former campaign chairman was convicted in August of financial crimes by a jury in Virginia and then pleaded guilty in September to reduced charges in Washington brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller as part of an investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 election.
Cause_General	Other cases include whether the U.S. attorney general has too much power in determining to whom the federal sex offender registry applies, and whether a state can execute a convicted murderer who, after a series of strokes, forgot the crime.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A number of hot-button issues may still be teed up for the justices this term, including disputes the court did not resolve last term over the constitutionality of an electoral map-drawing practice called partisan gerrymandering and whether people who run businesses can refuse service to gay couples because of religious objections to same-sex marriage.
Distant_Evaluation	“The real meat of the coming term is what’s in the pipeline,” Trump administration Solicitor General Noel Francisco said at an event organized by the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers’ group.
Cause_General	Major cases making their way up from lower courts include disputes over various abortion restrictions in Republican-led states, whether a federal law against sex discrimination also prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation, and Trump’s plan to restrict transgender troops in the military.
Distant_Evaluation	Even if only some of those issues come before the justices “we might be talking about this term as one of those blockbuster years that is comparable to what we saw last year,” Francisco said.
Main	ORLANDO, Florida/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a “good talk” on Monday with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the Justice Department official in charge of the federal investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election, and has no plans to fire him.
Cause_Specific	There has been widespread speculation that Trump might oust Rosenstein, a frequent target of Trump’s tweeted criticism, after a New York Times report that he had made remarks about Trump’s fitness for office and offered to record conversations with him.
Cause_Specific	Rosenstein traveled with Trump on Air Force One to Orlando on Monday, where the president gave a speech to police chiefs.
Distant_Evaluation	Upon landing, Rosenstein was seen smiling and appeared at ease as he walked down the front stairs of Air Force One alongside Trump’s chief of staff, John Kelly.
Distant_Evaluation	It was not immediately clear whether Trump and Rosenstein talked about the controversy during their 45-minute-long conversation on the flight, where Kelly and another Department of Justice official, Ed O’Callaghan, were also present.
Distant_Evaluation	They talked about support for law enforcement officials, border security, crime in Chicago and “general DOJ business,” White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said.
Distant_Evaluation	“The press wants to know, ‘What did you talk about?’” Trump said at the start of his speech after he thanked Rosenstein for being there and noted the intense media interest.
Distant_Evaluation	“We had a very good talk, I will say.
Distant_Evaluation	That became a very big story, actually.

Distant_Evaluation	BANGKOK (Reuters) - When Thailand’s army took power in a bloodless coup four years ago, it promised to bring happiness back to the “Land of Smiles” and return the country to democratic rule within two years.

Distant_Evaluation	The military said the coup was needed to stop further violence after months of street protests and to stamp out corruption which had plagued Thailand for decades.
Main	But as the coup’s fourth anniversary approaches on May 22, the ruling junta, or National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), is facing a public perception crisis, according to international and domestic polls which say corruption is as endemic as ever.
Cause_Specific	The government has also repeatedly delayed the general election, with the latest date set for February 2019.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some analysts say the date could be pushed back again.
Distant_Evaluation	When it first came to power, the NCPO vowed to tackle everything from so-called ‘taxi mafias’ to the illicit logging of forests.
Distant_Evaluation	Its military-backed parliament has passed 298 laws since 2014 and the junta has issued more than 500 orders, according to the National Legislative Assembly, making “huge changes to the legal system,” said Yingcheep Atchanont, a program manager at iLaw, a Thai legal monitoring group.
Cause_Specific	But in recent months the military government itself has been the subject of a protest in the northern city of Chiang Mai against the building of a government luxury housing project on forested land, the largest gathering since the junta took over.
Cause_Specific	It is also being investigated by the country’s anti-graft agency over a suspected misappropriation of around 129 million baht ($4 million) from a state fund for the poor.
Distant_Evaluation	“They announced they came into power to fix corruption and over the past four years have proved that they can’t,” said Yingcheep.
Distant_Historical	Transparency International’s 2017 Corruption Perceptions Index gave Thailand a score of 37 out of 100, slightly lower than in 2014 when the military took over.
Distant_Evaluation	But others think the military has done what it set out to do.
Distant_Evaluation	Mana Nimitmongkol, secretary-general of the Anti-Corruption Organization of Thailand, an independent body which monitors state corruption, told Reuters the military government has “done more to battle corruption than any other government in Thai history”.
Distant_Evaluation	PUBLIC DISCONTENT
Cause_Specific	However, delays to the general election have fueled a resurgence in anti-government street protests that have taken place intermittently since the start of the year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Somchai Srisutthiyakorn, a former election commissioner, said an upcoming parliamentary decision on whether to adopt one of four bills that need to be in place for the vote to happen could be delayed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The earliest we could see an election is March 2019, the latest would be June 2019,” Somchai told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	Deputy Prime Minister Prachin Chanthong told Reuters the junta means to make good on its promises.
Distant_Evaluation	“We want to see this country peaceful and united and have a better standard of living and higher income for everyone ... but it takes time,” said Prachin.
Distant_Evaluation	The Pheu Thai Party, whose government was ousted in the 2014 coup, said the junta had spent the last four years trying to extend its hold over Thai politics by strengthening the judiciary, the civil service, and independent organizations while weakening political parties and civil society.
Distant_Evaluation	“The NCPO has used its authority to maintain and extend power for themselves and their friends for as long as possible,” the party said in a statement on Thursday.
Cause_General	It rejected an invitation from the junta to join a meeting in June between the military government and political parties aimed at working out ground rules for the general election.
Distant_Evaluation	Although the junta has repeatedly promised to “return happiness to the Thai people”, some disgruntled Thais say they have run out of patience.
Cause_Specific	Recent protests have mostly been led by young activists, but others have been spearheaded by groups representing farmers and the urban poor.
Distant_Evaluation	“The junta came in, shut the people out, did everything their way.
Distant_Evaluation	So we can’t say we’re happy,” Prayong Doklamyai, a coordinator for People’s Movement for Just Society (P-Move), told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	Decharut Sukkhumnoed, an agricultural economist and lecturer at Bangkok’s Kasetsart University, said the agricultural sector, which accounts for around 8 percent of the economy, has been particularly hard-hit by the junta’s policies, which have prioritized other sectors.
Cause_General	Since 2014, rice and rubber farmers’ groups have threatened to stage protests, demanding the government improve farmers’ livelihoods.
Distant_Evaluation	The junta has since promised with billions of dollars in loans to help stabilize agricultural prices and offered cash handouts – leading critics to say it has employed tactics akin to the populist policies of the government it ousted.
Distant_Historical	According to the National Statistics Office, the bottom 45 percent of Thai population with the lowest income earned less per capita in 2017 than in 2015.
Error	Slideshow (13 Images)
Distant_Historical	While Thailand saw its GDP growth rise from 1 percent in 2014 to 3.9 percent in 2017, the agricultural sector saw negative GDP growth for ten quarters straight from 2014 to 2016, due to a decline in global commodity prices and weather woes, before recovering to a 6.2 percent growth in 2017.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Still, analysts say popular dissatisfaction is unlikely to dislodge the junta.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Leaders of the main, red-shirted opposition group told Reuters this month they were weary of more bloodshed if they take to the streets.
Distant_Evaluation	“The military still has the situation under control,” said Yutthaporn Isarachai, a political scientist at Sukhothai Thammathirat University.
Main	BANGKOK (Reuters) - A new Thai party that aims to shake up politics hit back at the ruling junta on Wednesday, accusing it of tarnishing the image of the southeast Asian nation by filing police charges against some party members.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Thailand is preparing for a general election by next May, promised by the military junta that has ruled since ousting a civilian government in 2014, ushering in curbs on politicians as well as arresting and jailing dozens of critics.
Distant_Evaluation	“The NCPO used its power to suppress the public who have political views that differ from its own,” the Future Forward Party said in a statement, referring to the junta by its official name, the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO).
Distant_Evaluation	“The results of these actions have impacted and damaged the image of the country,” it said on its official Facebook page.
Cause_General	The party launched this year, hoping to woo young people and win backing from those seeking an alternative to military rule.
Cause_General	It is led by an auto parts billionaire and newcomer to the political scene, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, 39.
Cause_Specific	He and two party members met police on Tuesday after the junta filed a police complaint over a June 29 speech by Thanathorn shown on Facebook, accusing the trio of provoking a “public disturbance” and violating the Computer Crimes Act.
Cause_General	Police said they were reviewing the charges.
Cause_Specific	“We called them in for interrogation,” the police official investigating the case, Athilak Whangsirivorakoon, told Reuters by telephone.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If, after their testimony, we think there is evidence, then we will proceed with charges.”
Cause_General	Reuters could not immediately reach a junta spokesman for comment.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, 64, an ex-army chief who led the coup, has shown signs of wanting to stay in power after next year’s vote, touring the countryside to meet people in what critics say is his bid to continue in the job.

Distant_Evaluation	Speaking of an oft-delayed general election, the 63-year-old Prayuth, who led a 2014 coup that ousted the last elected government, simply said: “Elect a good person.”
Cause_General	Prayuth was in Nakhon Pathom province last month not to campaign for an election, but to roll out his “Long-lasting Thainess” plan, which involves sending soldiers and social workers to meet with people across Thailand to listen to their problems.
Distant_Evaluation	But the “Thainess” undertaking is widely seen as the unofficial launch of Prayuth’s own campaign to stay on as prime minister.
Main	Prayuth had promised to hold an election in November, but said last week the vote would take place “no later” than February 2019.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Those in the government and the junta ... think that the situation in the country is still unsettled,” said a government minister, speaking on condition of anonymity, about the series of election delays.
Cause_General	ANTI-JUNTA PROTESTS
Cause_General	In Bangkok, young, middle-class Thais, have led a series of anti-junta protests, including one on Feb. 24 at Thammasat University - which Thai troops stormed in 1976, killing dozens of students in an earlier coup.
Distant_Evaluation	Than Rittiphan, a member of the New Democracy Movement, which has helped to organize the protests, said the movement is mainly aimed at holding a general election sooner.
Distant_Evaluation	The movement transcends the red-yellow divide in Thai politics and “has actually spread into a conflict between generations and values”, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	The students say they are pushing for a Thai meritocracy to replace what they see as corruption and nepotism in the system.
Distant_Evaluation	The latest protests are too small to be a factor in any election timing, said Kan Yuenyong, a political analyst and executive director of the Siam Intelligence Unit think-tank told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	“But they do increase public awareness about the vote.
Distant_Evaluation	“The underlying politics of Thailand is still about class – the upper, middle and the working class.
Distant_Evaluation	People try to say that we’ve moved on from color politics but we haven’t,” Kan said.
Cause_General	New King Maha Vajiralongkorn is contributing to some of the political uncertainty.
Cause_General	The king, who’s been married three times and lives much of his time in Germany, has moved quickly to consolidate power since taking the throne in December 2016, following the death of his father, the much beloved Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Cause_General	He made changes to the Privy Council, which advises the monarchy, and has made appointments himself, taking some of the control away from the military.
Cause_General	He made his own amendments to the military-drafted constitution and gained control of the Crown Property Bureau, which runs the more than $30 billion assets of the monarchy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The king has yet to set a date for his official coronation and some analysts think an election would not be held before then.
Cause_General	RED-YELLOW DIVIDE
Distant_Evaluation	The junta’s four-year moratorium on politics was aimed at stamping out the intransigent red-yellow divide in Thai politics.
Cause_General	The “yellow shirts” tended to support the Democrat Party, popular with middle-class voters with strong support in Bangkok and the Muslim-dominated south.
Cause_General	The “red shirt” movement of ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister, Yingluck appealed to poorer voters, particularly in the populous northeast.
Cause_General	It has won every election in Thailand over the past two decades.
Distant_Historical	Yingluck herself was overthrown by Prayuth in the 2014 coup and last year fled Thailand before the verdict in a corruption trial – eliminating a charismatic party figurehead who might also have rallied opposition to Prayuth.
Cause_General	Although he cannot stand for election, the constitution offers a way for Prayuth to continue serving as prime minister.
Cause_General	According to the constitution, both houses of parliament can consider an alternative candidate as prime minister if the 500-member lower house fails to approve a nominee for the post.
Cause_General	The candidate would need majority support from both houses - all 250 senators in the upper house are appointed by the junta.
Distant_Evaluation	Prayuth told reporters on Tuesday he had not been approached by any political party to be its candidate for the prime minister role.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is not time yet.
Distant_Evaluation	Nobody has contacted me so don’t use this issue to attack me.
Distant_Evaluation	Give me time to work,” Prayuth said in reply to a question about whether he had been approached.
Cause_General	Outside the legislature, Prayuth appears to have some support already.
Cause_General	Representatives of 114 political groups met this month with the election panel, with many pledging support for Prayuth as prime minister.
Error	Slideshow (3 Images)
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The two main parties, however, the Democrat Party and the Thaksin-allied Puea Thai Party, have openly criticized Prayuth’s election postponements and will field their own candidates for the prime minister job.
Distant_Evaluation	“The military wants to ensure that it can convince political parties to support it and that’s why it needs more time,” said a senior government aide, referring to the repeated postponements of the election.
Distant_Evaluation	Thaksin and his sister Yingluck held meetings in Hong Kong and Singapore last month with members of his party, prompting some to comment that he was readying Puea Thai for an election.

Distant_Evaluation	"Guterres congratulated the people of Colombia and saw the 2016 peace agreement as ""a watershed for the country and an inspiration for all those striving to end deadly conflict around the world through negotiations,"" said Guterres' press office in a statement."
Cause_General	After more than five decades of fighting, insurgents have set aside violence for politics; elections have been the most peaceful in decades; innovative institutions of transitional justice are up and running, and plans have been crafted through broad participation to extend development to remote, conflict-affected regions, said the statement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Hard work remains to be done to consolidate these early gains of peace, it said.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The secretary-general is convinced that this goal can be achieved through a concerted effort involving the government and state institutions, political parties, the private sector and civil society, with the accompaniment of the international community."""

Error	Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May leaves 10 Downing Street to speak to the British Parliament on the draft Brexit deal in London, Britain, on Nov. 15, 2018.
Error	(Xinhua/Stephen Chung)
Error	by Larry Neild
Main	LONDON, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- As British Prime Minister Theresa May appointed replacements Friday for the two front-bench ministers who quit this week, a leading expert in politics predicted she only stood a 50-50 chance of winning a challenge to her leadership.
Distant_Evaluation	Professor Philip Cowley from Queen Mary University of London said those odds of success for her reign at 10 Downing Street are not such a good position for her to be in.
Cause_General	As political commentators and parliamentary correspondents in London eagerly waited to see if a challenge to May emerges, the prime minster was busy at Number 10 hiring two new ministers to take over from Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Works and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey who quit this week from their government roles.
Distant_Evaluation	Both said they could not support the Brexit agreement agreed this week by the majority of May's cabinet.
Cause_General	Amber Rudd, who served as Home Secretary, essentially Britain's top interior minister, was brought back into the cabinet to succeed McVey.
Cause_General	Raab, who only took over the Brexit hot seat in July after the first holder of the post, David Davis, resigned, was succeeded by a politician relatively known outside the so-called Westminster bubble.
Distant_Evaluation	Health Minister Stephen Barclay was appointed to what political commentator described as the government job no politician wanted.
Distant_Historical	Former banker Barclay, who supported Britain leaving the European Union in the 2016 referendum, was appointed to the House of Commons in 2010, representing a constituency on Cambridgeshire.
Cause_General	The main attention remained focused firmly on May with reports that the number of names needed to trigger a vote of no confidence in her had reached the minimum 48 required.
Cause_General	In what is a highly secretive procedure, an announcement of a vote will be made at some stage, and result in a vote among the more than 300 Conservative MPs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Professor Cowley believes a no-confidence move could even give May a boost if she wins the vote among Conservative MPs who sit in the House of Commons.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Even if she wins by one vote it would mean she could not be challenged again for a year,"" he said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Cowley, a political scientist, who has co-authored a new book, The British General Election of 2017, said if May lost the vote, or decided to step down if she won only by an insignificant margin, there would have to be a leadership contest to elect a new leader and prime minister, causing a delay of several weeks to the Brexit roller-coaster.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	May, he said, could be strengthened by the party's own rules which would prevent a second challenge for at least a year.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It would immediately mean that attack would disappear."
Distant_Evaluation	At the moment May is facing a battle on two flanks, one in parliament and the other within her own Conservative Party.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""If she won the vote of confidence by a big enough margin to carry on, and there has been talk of her winning by around 100, she would be at least able not to have to worry about another challenge from her own MPs."""
Cause_Specific	Cowley said one problem for May could be Conservative MPs who had not wanted a challenge in the first place, but who had doubts about her leadership, deciding that this would be their one chance to seek a new party leader.
Main	"""My own hunch is that this would be a 50-50 chance of her winning this, and that is not a good position for a prime minister to be in."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But Cowley said May, or a successor, would have to steer the Brexit measures through the British Parliament with one possible outcome a confidence vote.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That, said Cowley, could see the Conservative government collapsing with a general election early in 2019 -- possibly around January or February.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Such an election could, he said, see Labour's Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister of a minority government, bidding to negotiate a Brexit deal or an extension to the Article 50 process that started the ball rolling in the first place to end Britain's EU membership.

Orlins, president of the U.S. National Committee on U.S.-China Relations (NCUSCR), at its annual gala dinner in New York City."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Noting that ties between the world's two largest economies are now experiencing a difficult time, Orlins believed that in the end it is the people of the United States and China who will determine the future of the U.S.-China relationship.
Distant_Evaluation	"Also at the gala dinner, Dr. Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. secretary of state, told the audience: ""I think we are now at a moment of fundamental importance in our relationship."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""The fundamental issue is whether two great countries can live together in a new world for international politics ... in which we find that we emphasize the importance of better relations and the importance of co-existence,"" said the 95-year-old diplomat and renowned strategist, who just returned from a trip to Beijing."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""I think it can be done,"" said Kissinger, whose secret visit to China in the early 1970s broke the ice and paved the way for the normalization of U.S.-China relations,"
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Calling himself a realist in international politics and a witness to many crises and their solutions, Kissinger hoped that both countries can act with the conviction that ""the practical problems before us are difficult, but the opportunity before us is to create an international system for the first time in world history in which peace and order are accepted by all the nations."""
Distant_Evaluation	Echoing the U.S. experts' views, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Cui Tiankai, who braved the first snowfall on the East Coast and traveled all the way to New York from Washington D.C. for the event, also called for efforts to safeguard the sound development of bilateral ties for the benefits of both peoples and the world at large.
Distant_Evaluation	"Cui noted in his speech that despite the tremendous changes that have taken place in the world over all these years, the people of China and the United States have succeeded in ""building a strong and growing relationship between the two great countries."""

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Following an approach that emphasizes coordination and cooperation, ""we will be able to build an even stronger and more comprehensive, win-win relationship for our two countries,"" said the ambassador."
Cause_General	Present at the NCUSCR gala were some 400 people, including experts, scholars, officials, diplomats and business representatives.
Cause_General	At the event, Orlins noted that over the past 12 months, the Committee has conducted 177 public programs, dialogues and exchanges on U.S.-China relations.

Main	The Justice Department, in an indictment disclosed Monday, charged that agencies of the Indian government participated in a conspiracy to sidestep United States export regulations and obtain secret weapons technology from American companies over several years.
Main	The indictment charges that a private electronics firm, Cirrus Inc., operating in Singapore, South Carolina and Bangalore, India, was working as an agent of the Indian government to obtain sensitive missile and weapons technology for its military programs.
Main	It lists four company officials, including the founder, Parthasarathy Sudarshan, and a number of unidentified co-conspirators who were not charged, including one mentioned only as an Indian government official who worked in Washington.
Cause_Specific	The indictment indicates that the defendants were buying equipment for three Indian government agencies.
Distant_Evaluation	The charges, coming just months after Congress approved President Bush's plan to ship American nuclear reactors and fuel to India, could prove to be a diplomatic embarrassment for the administration, which has made cementing closer ties with India a top foreign policy priority.
Distant_Evaluation	The indictment suggests that India broke a pledge to the Bush administration more than two years ago not to flout American export laws and secretly seek weapons technology from the United States.
Cause_General	Although Congress has signed off on the nuclear deal, India must still reach a separate agreement on nuclear inspections with several international organizations before the deal is complete.
Distant_Historical	In a letter to the State Department in September 2004, Shyam Saran, then the Indian foreign secretary, wrote, ''The Government of India shall not obtain or use U.S. origin licensable items in contravention of U.S. export control laws and regulations.''
Distant_Historical	The weapons sales detailed in the indictment occurred between 2003 and 2006 and were shipped to government agencies that were part of the Indian Ministry of Defense and Department of Space.
Cause_Specific	The defendants were charged with violating the United States Export Administration Act, which prohibits the export of dual-use technologies, those with both military and nonmilitary uses, without approval from the Commerce Department attesting that the technology will be used only for nonmilitary purposes.
Cause_Specific	The indictment charges that Cirrus officials sometimes forged certificates to show the vendors in the United States that the sales had Commerce Department approval.
Cause_General	Officials at the Indian Embassy in Washington declined to comment except to say that government officials in New Delhi have pledged to look into the allegations.
Distant_Evaluation	Some critics of the nuclear deal reacted angrily to the indictment, and criticized the administration for pressing Congress to approve the agreement at the same time that the Justice Department was investigating an alleged conspiracy involving Indian government officials.
Distant_Evaluation	''This is not only an indictment of individuals for breaking export control law, it is also a blistering indictment of the Bush administration's judgment,'' said Representative Edward J.

Main	MANCHESTER, N.H. (Reuters) - Enthusiasm for the Democratic Party is waning among millennials as its candidates head into the crucial midterm congressional elections, according to the Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll.
Main	The online survey of more than 16,000 registered voters ages 18 to 34 shows their support for Democrats over Republicans for Congress slipped by about 9 percentage points over the past two years, to 46 percent overall.
Main	And they increasingly say the Republican Party is a better steward of the economy.
Cause_Specific	Although nearly two of three young voters polled said they do not like Republican President Donald Trump, their distaste for him does not necessarily extend to all Republicans or translate directly into votes for Democratic congressional candidates.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That presents a potential problem for Democrats who have come to count on millennials as a core constituency - and will need all the loyalty they can get to achieve a net gain of 23 seats to capture control of the U.S. House of Representatives in November.
Distant_Evaluation	Young voters represent an opportunity and a risk for both parties, said Donald Green, a political science professor at Columbia University in New York City.
Distant_Evaluation	“They’re not as wedded to one party,” Green said.
Distant_Evaluation	“They’re easier to convince than, say, your 50- or 60-year-olds who don’t really change their minds very often.”
Distant_Anecdotal	Terry Hood, 34, an African-American who works at a Dollar General store in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and took this year’s poll, said he voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Distant_Anecdotal	But he will consider a Republican for Congress because he believes the party is making it easier to find jobs and he applauds the recent Republican-led tax cut.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It sounds strange to me to say this about the Republicans, but they’re helping with even the small things,” Hood said in a phone interview.
Distant_Anecdotal	“They’re taking less taxes out of my paycheck.
Distant_Anecdotal	I notice that.”
Cause_Specific	The Reuters/Ipsos poll surveyed young voters during the first three months of this year and the same period in 2016.
Cause_Specific	Only 28 percent of those polled expressed overt support for Republicans in the 2018 poll - about the same percentage as two years earlier.
Cause_Specific	But that does not mean the rest will turn out to back Democrats, the survey showed.
Cause_Specific	A growing share of voters between ages 18 and 34 years old said they were undecided, would support a third-party candidate or not vote at all.
Distant_Evaluation	The shift away from Democrats was more pronounced among white millennials - who accounted for two-thirds of all votes cast in that age group in 2016.
Distant_Anecdotal	Two years ago, young white people favored Democrats over Republicans for Congress by a margin of 47 to 33 percent; that gap vanished by this year, with 39 percent supporting each party.
Cause_Specific	The shift was especially dramatic among young white men, who two years ago favored Democrats but now say they favor Republicans over Democrats by a margin of 46 to 37 percent, the Reuters/Ipsos poll showed.
Distant_Anecdotal	Ashley Reed, a white single mother of three in New Hampshire, said a teenage fascination with Democrat Barack Obama led her to support his presidency in 2008.
Distant_Anecdotal	But her politics evolved with her personal life.
Distant_Anecdotal	Reed, now 28, grew more supportive of gun rights, for instance, while married to her now ex-husband, a U.S. Navy technician.
Distant_Anecdotal	She lost faith in social welfare programs she came to believe were misused.
Distant_Anecdotal	She opposed abortion after having children.
Distant_Anecdotal	Reed plans to vote for a Republican for Congress this year.
Distant_Anecdotal	“As I got older, I felt that I could be my own voice,” she said last month in Concord, New Hampshire.

Distant_Evaluation	A SWING DISTRICT
Cause_General	Down the road from where Reed lives lies New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, a hiker’s paradise of evergreen thickets and snow-capped lakes where young white voters make up about a quarter of the electorate, compared to 21 percent nationally.
Cause_General	The district’s House seat has changed parties five times in seven election cycles and is up for grabs this year after the Democratic incumbent declined to seek re-election.
Distant_Evaluation	New Hampshire’s Democrats have an early edge in voter enthusiasm after a string of victories in races for state legislative seats, said Christopher Galdieri, a politics professor at Saint Anselm College in Manchester.
Distant_Evaluation	At a campaign event at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, Mindi Messmer, one of eight Democrats running in the primary election, touted her work as an environmental crusader.
Distant_Evaluation	But students in the crowd also raised many other issues, notably the local economy.
Distant_Anecdotal	“People come to school here, and then they move away because they can’t get jobs,” said Acadia Spear, 18, of Portsmouth.
Distant_Anecdotal	Spear said she would likely vote for a Democrat, but her peers nationally are increasingly looking to Republicans for economic leadership, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll.
Main	Millennials are almost evenly split this year over the question of which party has a better plan for the economy, with 34 percent picking the Democrats and 32 percent choosing Republicans.
Distant_Historical	That’s a shift from two years ago, when they said Democrats had the better plan by a 12-point margin.
Distant_Anecdotal	In Manchester, the biggest city in New Hampshire’s 1st District, tattoo artist Ashley Matthias, 31, said she has not decided how she will vote but will support anyone who will make her health insurance more affordable.
Distant_Anecdotal	As she drilled an eagle in black ink across a client’s shoulder blades, Matthias explained that it is cheaper to pay for her doctor’s visits out-of-pocket than to buy insurance through the government-run Obamacare exchange.
Distant_Anecdotal	“You just hope nothing happens to you,” she said.
Distant_Evaluation	BATTLE FOR THE YOUTH VOTE
Distant_Historical	After the bruising loss in the presidential election of 2016, the Democratic Party learned it needed to reach young voters on their turf, including on social media and at college campuses, said Elizabeth Renda, who specializes in reaching young voters for the Democratic National Committee.
Distant_Historical	“Instead of having real conversations with them, we settled for TV ads,” Renda said of the 2016 failure.
Cause_General	Earlier this year, the DNC launched its “IWillVote” initiative, aimed in part at registering millennials to vote.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The party also will run ads via social media and text, and it plans to send buses to college campuses on election day to bring students to the polls.
Cause_General	The Democratic National Committee declined to comment on the Reuters poll.
Distant_Evaluation	Republican National Committee spokeswoman Cassie Smedile said the poll indicates that young voters “like what they’ve seen” from the party in power.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Republican committee plans to target young voters in part through a pilot program to get out the vote at six college campuses, Smedile said.
Distant_Evaluation	In New Hampshire, Eddie Edwards, one of two Republicans running for Congress in the 1st District, said he pitches millennials on ways the government should help college graduates pay off their student loans.
Distant_Evaluation	He also argues that public secondary schools must better prepare students to find jobs without attending college.
Distant_Evaluation	“This is a generation that has much more access to information than others,” he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Unless you’re addressing those issues that are important to them, it’s hard to get them involved.”
Cause_Specific	The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English throughout the United States.
Cause_Specific	It gathered about 65,000 responses in all during the first three months of 2018 and 2016, including 16,000 registered voters between the ages of 18 and 34 and nearly 11,000 registered white millennial voters.

Distant_Historical	The military, after taking power, clamped a tight lid on politics, and the rivalry between the military-royalist establishment and new upstart political forces that had roiled the country for a decade was stifled.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But now a long-promised general election is on the horizon - due sometime between February and May - and old animosities are stirring and veteran political brawler Suthep, 68, is back.
Main	Suthep, a one-time deputy prime minister in a pro-establishment government, has said he will contest the election under the banner of a new party he set up to sustain the work of the military government and to campaign for its leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha, to be prime minister of a civilian administration.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The return of Suthep, who has a record of mobilizing crowds on the streets in support of the establishment, could be a big asset for the military which has made no secret of its aim to retain a grip over politics after the election.
Cause_General	The military and Suthep have common cause in their burning desire to rid the country of the influence of former premier Thaksin Shinawatra and his family, whose supporters have been biding their time and pinning their hopes on the election.
Distant_Evaluation	Suthep makes no secret of his support for former army chief Prayuth and his wish to see him return as prime minister after the vote, but says he must defer to his new party, the Action Coalition for Thailand, which has yet to spell out its position.
Distant_Evaluation	“He’s a good guy, not corrupt, determined, and he has the trust of his people and is loyal to the monarchy,” Suthep told Reuters in a recent interview.
Distant_Evaluation	“So I cheer him on, the more he can succeed, the better for the country,” Suthep said, while adding he had no desire to take on any leadership role in a new government.
Distant_Historical	Suthep, for years known as a pugnacious deal-maker, has been a central figure in well over a decade of turmoil that began in 2000, when former telecommunications tycoon Thaksin became prime minister for the first time.
Distant_Historical	Thaksin fired up support in the provinces with pro-poor policies, and shook up politics with his brash, election-winning ways.
Cause_General	In the process, he made enemies in the Bangkok-based, military-dominated establishment, which accused him of corruption and buying election victories.
Distant_Historical	Suthep, a former shrimp and palm-oil magnate from Thailand’s south, served as deputy prime minister in a pro-establishment government after Thaksin was ousted in a 2006 coup, and which oversaw a bloody crackdown on Thaksin’s “red-shirt” supporters occupying Bangkok streets in 2010.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Suthep expects his party’s support to come from Thaksin’s main enemies, the Bangkok middle class, and he’s keen to see that the party sets an example with transparent funding and the inclusion of women, to bolster that support.
Distant_Evaluation	‘LEADERS GONE’
Distant_Historical	Suthep lead protests against a government formed in 2011 by Thaksin’s sister, Yingluck Shinawatra, rallying pro-establishment crowds who tried to march on the government’s offices to shut it down.
Distant_Historical	The turmoil eventually triggered the coup by then army chief Prayuth.
Distant_Historical	Suthep and his allies celebrated the fall of another government loyal to their enemy, Thaksin.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Suthep said he expected Thaksin’s party to see its support whittled down in its northern and northeastern heartlands in the next election, though the Shinawatras still commanded a significant block of votes.
Distant_Evaluation	But the people were slowly seeing the truth about them, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“All their leaders are gone,” Suthep said of the voters who have loyally stuck with Thaksin’s parties.
Distant_Evaluation	“People can see that the brother and sister have fled, deserting those that served them, who are in jail, from cabinet ministers to ordinary folk,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	Thaksin has been living in exile since 2008 to avoid a graft conviction he said was politically motivated.
Distant_Historical	Yingluck fled from the country last August during a criminal negligence trial that eventually sentenced her to five years in jail.
Distant_Evaluation	She also denied wrongdoing.
Distant_Evaluation	Suthep praised the military government for overseeing the introduction of a constitution that critics say enshrines the military’s sway over civilian governments.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But he said the military government had not completed its work and he wanted his party to ensure the country would stay on the course the military had set, with no sliding back to what he described as the dangerous old ways.

Main	The 14, who are all members or supporters of Cambodia’s now dissolved main opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), were released from Phnom Penh’s Prey Sar prison.
Distant_Historical	They were convicted in 2014 of insurrection after they forcibly tried to reopen the country’s only designated protest venue, “Freedom Park”, in July that year and were handed jail terms ranging from seven to 20 years.
Distant_Evaluation	The convictions were widely criticized as politically motivated.
Distant_Evaluation	“We have been waiting a long time to see Cambodians really reconcile as a nation with democratic principles and respect for human rights,” Meach Sovannara, one of the 14, told reporters after police dropped him off at his home in Phnom Penh.
Cause_General	Hun Sen’s Cambodian People’s Party (CPP) swept all parliamentary seats in last month’s largely unopposed election.
Distant_Evaluation	But rights groups said the July 29 vote was neither free nor fair given the absence of a significant challenger to Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for 33 years.
Cause_General	Hun Sen has requested pardons for 23 people since Aug. 17.
Distant_Evaluation	Sebastian Strangio, author of the book “Hun Sen’s Cambodia”, said the pardons served a dual function of easing domestic political tensions and presenting Western critics with some marginal signs of democratic progress.
Distant_Evaluation	“This does not signify any substantial change in Hun Sen’s mentality,” Strangio told Reuters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If the CPP faces a serious challenge before the next election, history suggests that Hun Sen will do whatever he needs to do in order to maintain his hold on power,” he added.
Distant_Evaluation	Government spokesman Phay Siphan said that the recent pardons were a “humanitarian” act by Hun Sen and not a response to international criticism.
Distant_Evaluation	MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte thinks political dynasties are bad.
Distant_Evaluation	But the way the prevailing political winds are blowing, it looks like a dynasty of his own might be taking shape.
Main	Nine months away from mid-term elections that could determine the success or failure of his presidency, his daughter, Sara Duterte, is fast emerging as a power-broker who is aiming to shore up support for his ambitious policy agenda, and, say some experts and insiders, his eventual succession.
Distant_Evaluation	By his own admission, the 73-year-old president is flagging.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On Tuesday, he lamented his uphill struggle to tackle illicit drugs and cut state corruption, predicting that he’ll “hardly make a dent” in his remaining four years in office.
Distant_Evaluation	During a ceremony and again at a dinner afterwards, he said he was tired, exasperated and thinking about quitting, and ended his somber, one hour, 20 minute speech with: “I’m telling you, I’m ready to step down and retire.”
Cause_General	That contrasts sharply from his 40-year-old daughter, who has started maneuvering to build alliances and expand her small party in the southern Davao region into a new political juggernaut, as fissures appear in her father’s ruling PDP-Laban party.
Cause_General	She was instrumental in bringing together political factions to stage a dramatic July 23 ousting of divisive Duterte ally Pantaleon Alvarez as lower house speaker, replacing him with veteran Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, 71, a former president with clout and connections to ensure support for Duterte and his agenda.
Cause_General	The move was helped by a relationship developing between Sara Duterte and Imee Marcos, 62, a provincial governor and key figure in the still influential family of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for two decades before being ousted in a 1986 uprising.
Error	The two women posed together for pictures last week, each with one hand doing Duterte’s trademark clenched fist, and making a “V” sign synonymous with the rule of Marcos with the other.
Error	(For a graphic on 'Philippine First Daughters' click tmsnrt.rs/2KV4KT7)
Distant_Evaluation	Rodrigo Duterte’s rise has been a boon for the Marcos family.
Distant_Historical	Imee Marcos frequently attends his official events and in 2016, Duterte granted her longstanding wish for her father to be buried with military honors at a Manila heroes’ cemetery.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Duterte also said last week that if he steps down, her brother, Ferdinand Marcos Jr, a former senator better known as “Bongbong”, would have been a capable replacement for him.
Distant_Historical	Marcos Jr came a close second to Leni Robredo, a rival of Duterte, in the 2016 vice presidential election, but he has challenged the result in the Supreme Court.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“NEW CENTER OF GRAVITY”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Richard Heydarian, an author, columnist and academic who specializes in politics, said the Marcos family wanted to stay relevant nationally and in a political culture where loyalties easily shift, Sara Duterte was now widely seen as a figure worth rallying behind.

Distant_Evaluation	“People around (Rodrigo) Duterte are looking for a new center of gravity.
Distant_Evaluation	They see signs of an exhausted president and see there could be some kind of succession that can protect their interests,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“He has a very shallow network of politicians, he’s not at his peak.
Distant_Evaluation	He just has to hold on as long as he can.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Duterte acknowledges that, and on Tuesday said he can’t resign because a constitutional succession would mean handing power to opposition leader and vice president Robredo, who was elected separately.
Distant_Evaluation	He said Robredo isn’t up to the job - which she refutes - and he’d prefer a junta takes over.
Distant_Evaluation	Duterte’s relationship with daughter Sara has however often appeared rocky and she has portrayed herself as his reluctant successor as mayor of Davao City.
Distant_Evaluation	Like her father, she is feared and respected, and known for being blunt, unpredictable and for openly trading barbs with the president.
Distant_Evaluation	Despite that, few doubt her loyalty to him.
Main	Although she denies being interested, she and other Duterte allies, including his spokesman, his special assistant and his former police chief, are tipped to run for the 24-seat Senate in 2019, as is Imee Marcos.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That could be a game-changer for the president, who has built a strong majority in the House of Representatives but needs control of the upper house to deliver on his promises.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Among a raft of plans, he wants to redraft the constitution and deliver his centerpiece economic policy, a $180 billion infrastructure spree designed to modernize the country, spur spending, create jobs and lure investment.
Distant_Evaluation	“Now is the chance to further consolidate power by controlling both houses of congress and the local government units so all of us can we move forward in cadence,” said a member of a nine-party alliance formed by Sara Duterte last week.
Cause_General	He requested anonymity, saying only Sara Duterte could speak about the alliance.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The goal is, fill the Senate with people who can help ... We don’t want people who will only obstruct his plans.”
Distant_Evaluation	Opposition lawmaker Antonio Tinio said Rodrigo Duterte was essentially a local politician thrust into the presidency and needed national level allies.
Distant_Evaluation	“Hence, his alliance with the Marcoses and Gloria Arroyo,” he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Tinio is skeptical about Duterte’s talk of retirement and is among many opponents who suspect he’ll try to continue beyond his permitted single six-year term - an idea Duterte this week said was idiotic.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This money was to be invested in our small and medium enterprises for them to develop, innovate and hire.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"If that is not the case, if the evaluation is not good, then we can reopen it for discussion,"" he added."
Cause_Specific	Shortly after his inauguration in May 2017, President Emmanuel Macron amended the tax on profits above 1 million euros (1.135 million U.S. dollars) imposed by his predecessor Francois Hollande.
Cause_Specific	"Eyeing to encourage investment in real economy and create jobs, he maintained only the tax on real estate and cancelled that covering other assets including jewelry to yachts, a move that ignited critics, describing him as ""president of the rich."""

Cause_General	"Taking their name from the high visibility vests drivers keep in their cars, the ""Yellow Vests"" is spontaneous action created on social media to oppose planned increase in tax fuel and diesel's price, the most commonly used car fuel in France."

Distant_Evaluation	He said China would fulfill all its promises to let more local people benefit from China-Tonga cooperation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Xi also said that China would like to enhance cooperation with Tonga on climate change and strengthen exchanges with Pacific island countries.
Distant_Evaluation	Tupou VI, who arrived in Beijing Wednesday for a nine-day state visit, first congratulated the Communist Party of China (CPC) on the successful conclusion of the 19th National Congress.

Cause_General	The new government is seeking answers to how billions of dollars disappeared from a state fund that Najib founded, and its anti-graft agency has asked the ex-premier, who has consistently denied any wrongdoing, to make a statement at its headquarters on Tuesday.
Cause_General	In the case of the murdered Mongolian model, two policemen from Najib’s security detail were convicted, and have death sentences hanging over them, but the question of who ordered them to kill 28-year-old Altantuya has never been answered.
Distant_Historical	While released on bail during an appeal one of those officers fled to Australia.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Speaking from an immigration detention centre, where he has been held since 2015 for overstaying his visa, Sirul Azhar Umar told news portal Malaysiakini that he would help any move by the government to resurrect the case so long as he walked free.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Hence, I am willing to assist the new government to tell what actually transpired provided that the government grants me full pardon,” he was quoted as saying.
Cause_General	Najib, who was deputy prime minister and defence minister at the time of the murder, has denied knowing Altantuya or playing any role in her death, but the mystery has haunted his political career.
Cause_General	Calls by Reuters to Najib’s spokesman for comment on the latest developments went unanswered.
Distant_Historical	His relative and one-time close associate, Abdul Razak Baginda, a defence consultant and political analyst who was said to have been the dead woman’s lover, had been charged with abetting the murder but was acquitted in 2008.
Main	Mongolian President Battulga Khaltmaa’s call for justice was made in a congratulatory message to the 92-year-old Mahathir.
Main	“As president of Mongolia, I pay special attention to the aggravated crime, that on October 18, 2006, a citizen of Mongolia and mother of two children, Shaariibuu Altantuya, was murdered in Malaysia,” he said in the letter to Mahathir that was also posted on his office’s website.
Distant_Evaluation	ANWAR ADVOCATES NEW CHARGES
Distant_Evaluation	Mahathir, asked on Monday whether he would consider commuting Sirul’s death sentence, said: “We cannot do everything at the same time at one go.” (Full Story)
Distant_Evaluation	Anwar Ibrahim, the rival who allied with Mahathir to topple Najib, said judges’ reluctance to call key witnesses in the murder case had “made a mockery of the law”.
Distant_Evaluation	“The best way is to proffer a new charge and allow for a full hearing of the case,” Anwar told The Australian newspaper following his own release from prison earlier this week after a royal pardon quashed a politically-motivated sodomy conviction.
Distant_Evaluation	In his interview with Malaysiakini, Sirul thanked Anwar “for calling for a fresh trial”.
Distant_Evaluation	Civil society groups have alleged Altantuya’s murder was linked to her role as an interpreter and associate of Najib’s adviser, Abdul Razak Baginda, during Malaysia’s negotiations to buy two submarines from French shipbuilding giant DCNS in 2002.
Distant_Evaluation	Najib has denied allegations of links to Altantuya or graft during the deal.
Cause_General	LUXURY HANDBAGS, CASH
Cause_General	On Saturday, Najib and his wife hit out at the media and police, after investigators seeking evidence of corruption were filmed seizing box loads of jewelry, luxury handbags and cash.
Cause_General	Items seized by police from Najib’s residence and other locations linked to the couple included Birkin handbags from French designer firm Hermes, some costing more than a sports car.
Cause_General	Dozens of the luxury bags were filled with cash and jewelry.

Distant_Evaluation	Najib’s lawyer, Harpal Singh Grewal, told reporters waiting outside the house that the former prime minister and his family were “really very unhappy” that police had confiscated clothes and shoes belonging to his children.
Distant_Evaluation	“No attempt was made to verify whether these dresses, shoes, baby clothes and all had anything to do with the investigations which are ongoing,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	His wife, Rosmah Mansor, whose lavish taste has made a her a focus for anger, also issued a statement through her lawyers calling on law enforcement agencies to avoid “feeding social media trolls” and a “premature public trial”.

Main	Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland will hold fresh talks on the North American Free Trade Agreement with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington on Wednesday as a U.S.-imposed deadline of Oct. 1 looms.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The two sides are far apart in some areas and Trudeau says his Liberal government will walk away if necessary.
Distant_Evaluation	Signs are growing that hitherto solid domestic support for Ottawa’s stance is fraying amid fears of the potential economic damage.
Cause_General	The United States takes 75 percent of Canada’s goods exports and President Donald Trump is threatening to impose tariffs on autos.
Distant_Evaluation	Freeland defended Ottawa’s stance on Tuesday, saying “any negotiator who goes into a negotiation believing that he or she must get a deal at any price ... (will) be forced to pay the maximum price for that deal.”
Distant_Evaluation	That approach though is starting to worry some.
Distant_Evaluation	“The problem with the bold statement that ‘No deal is better than a bad deal’ is that a bad deal is very much in the eye of the beholder,” said John Manley, a former Liberal finance minister who heads the Business Council of Canada, which groups many chief executives.
Distant_Evaluation	“Anyone who thought ... we were going to get something better than what we had under NAFTA 1.0 was delusional.
Distant_Evaluation	We knew that this was all about taking some things away,” Manley said by phone on Tuesday.
Distant_Historical	Trump came to power last year threatening to tear up NAFTA unless major changes were made to a pact he blames for the loss of manufacturing jobs.
Cause_General	Last month he announced a side deal with Mexico and made clear he was prepared to exclude Canada if necessary.
Distant_Evaluation	“Canada has taken advantage of our country for a long time.
Distant_Evaluation	We love Canada ... but they are in a position that is not a good position,” Trump told reporters on Tuesday, complaining about high Canadian dairy tariffs.
Cause_General	U.S. negotiators are pressing for more access to Canada’s protected dairy market.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Doug Ford, the premier of Ontario - Canada’s most populous province and center of the auto industry - will meet Canadian negotiators on Wednesday to express his concerns.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“You’re all hearing the rumors that we are hearing, that maybe they don’t want a deal.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	So we’re going down there to say that ‘You bloody well need to get a deal’,” Ontario trade minister Jim Wilson said on Monday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Trudeau’s Liberals have no chance of winning a federal election set for October 2019 unless they do well in Ontario.
Distant_Evaluation	In the western province of Saskatchewan, premier Scott Moe also expressed concern about walking away from the talks.
Distant_Evaluation	“We cannot move forward with a bad deal, I’m not certain we can move forward with no deal either,” he said last Thursday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Trudeau told an interviewer on Monday that a decision point might be weeks away.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Canadian officials say they do not believe the U.S. Congress would ever back the idea of excluding Canada from NAFTA.
Distant_Evaluation	Manley said his members were increasingly concerned that Trudeau’s team might be relying on Congress, which he termed “a very high risk strategy”.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	U.S. Republican House Majority Whip Steve Scalise on Tuesday cited “a growing frustration with many in Congress” over Canadian negotiating tactics and suggested Canada could be left out of NAFTA.
Cause_General	In a separate Washington development, U.S. business leaders on Tuesday urged the administration to include Canada in any trade agreement with Mexico.

Main	WASHINGTON, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- CIA Director Gina Haspel on Wednesday briefed some U.S. House leaders on the death of a Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi.
Distant_Evaluation	However, her briefing has had little effect in changing the Representatives' minds, according to U.S. media reports.
Distant_Evaluation	Sources familiar with the meeting were quoted as saying that the briefing was conducted on Wednesday morning on a classified condition.
Distant_Evaluation	The meeting ended as lawmakers told the media before leaving that they had not heard anything that would change their minds about Khashoggi's death.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, possibly the next chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, was quoted by Reuters as saying that he intended to hold hearings starting early next year to review all aspects of Saudi Arabia's behavior and the U.S.-Saudi relationship.
Distant_Evaluation	"""I think that all leaders are responsible for things that happen under them."
Distant_Evaluation	"So I think that we've still got to get to the bottom of it,"" he noted."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Saudi Arabia's an important... partner, but I don't think we can simply look the other way when things happen and talk about business as usual."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Haspel has briefed a group of senators over the case earlier, but several senators said after the briefing that there was ""zero chance"" the Saudi crown prince wasn't involved in the killing."
Cause_General	"The Senate was preparing to vote on two resolutions that would condemn Saudi Arabia's role in both Khashoggi's case and the Yemen conflict, despite the earlier briefing of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary Defense James Mattis last month, when they said there was ""no smoking gun"" to prove the Saudi leader has directly ordered to kill Khashoggi."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said earlier the Senate would vote as soon as Wednesday on a resolution calling for the U.S. suspension of all its assistance for the Saudi-led war in Yemen.
Distant_Evaluation	Bob Corker, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, also told the media that he was preparing a separate resolution condemning the journalist's killing.
Distant_Evaluation	McConnell urged senators to vote for Corker's proposal.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	For their parts, Pompeo and Mattis are expected to brief the full House on Khashoggi's case on Thursday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Earlier on Wednesday, Pompeo told the Fox & Friends show in an interview that ""we'll continue to develop the facts, but America has an important ally in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia."""
Distant_Evaluation	"However, he refused to say whether he believes the Saudi crown prince's denial of personal involvement in the killing, only noting that ""the direct evidence isn't yet available."
Distant_Evaluation	"It may show up tomorrow; it may have shown up overnight and I haven't seen it."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that he would stand with the Saudi Arabian crown prince despite the death of Khashoggi.
Distant_Evaluation	"Noting that he would meet with senators in the hope that they would not propose to stop arms sales to the Saudis, Trump added that he could abide by legislation that requires to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led attack in Yemen, since he personally ""hate to see what's going on"" there."

Main	WASHINGTON, Dec. 13 (Xinhua) -- In unusual pushbacks against the Trump administration, the GOP-controlled U.S. Senate on Thursday voted to recommend ending U.S. military assistance to the Saudi-led operation in Yemen, and accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of involvement in the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Main	Immediately after the 56-41 vote on a resolution concerning the Yemen conflict, the Senate unanimously passed a separate one that blames the Saudi crown prince for Khashoggi's murder and urges Saudi Arabia to hold accountable anyone responsible for his death.
Main	In the first resolution, lawmakers recommended that the U.S. government should stop its backing of the Saudi-led operation in Yemen, despite the briefings of senior officials like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense James Mattis last month.
Main	"In the second resolution, the Senate believed that the Saudi crown prince is ""responsible for the murder"" of Khashoggi, and urging the Saudi Arabian government to ""ensure appropriate accountability."""
Cause_Specific	The bipartisan votes came amid the Capitol Hill's growing outrage over high civilian casualties in Yemen, plus U.S. intelligence officials' reported conclusion that the Saudi leader must have at least known the murder of Khashoggi.
Distant_Evaluation	"Independent Senator Bernie Sanders, who co-sponsored the Yemen resolution with Republican Senator Mike Lee, said the vote has shown the Senate's view ""that the constitutional responsibility for making war rests with the United States Congress."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""Today we tell the despotic government of Saudi Arabia that we will not be part of their military adventures,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""So let us go forward today ... and tell the world that the United States of America will not continue to be part of the worst humanitarian disaster on the face of the earth."""
Cause_General	The resolution condemning Saudi Arabia's role in Khashoggi's death was introduced by senators like Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker and majority leader Mitch McConnell, both of whom are Republicans.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The two resolutions, unlikely to either get passed by the House or approved by U.S. President Donald Trump, were seen as largely symbolic, U.S. media reported.
Cause_General	Pompeo and Mattis had briefed the full House on the U.S.-Saudi relations, especially the Yemen conflict and the case of Khashoggi in a classified condition.

Main	LONDON, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- The UK financial markets remained positive on Wednesday evening as Prime Minister Theresa May was preparing for a no confidence vote.
Cause_Specific	British stocks and the pound were both surging.
Cause_Specific	The FTSE 100 rose 1.08 percent to close at 6880.19 points, while the more domestic-focused FTSE 250 index was up 1.90 percent to close at 17,988.97 points.
Cause_General	UK property developers Berkeley Group and Barratt Developments, house building company Persimmon, and engineering company Rolls-Royce were among the best performers.
Cause_Specific	The pound was up 0.75 percent against the euro, and 1.32 against the U.S. dollar as the no confidence vote started at 1800 GMT.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The vote will be anonymous and the result is expected to be announced at around 2100 GMT.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The buoyancy seen in the markets came as media reports indicated May has more support than 158 Tory MPs to win the no confidence vote.
Distant_Evaluation	Hours before the vote started, the UK business community voiced heightened concerns, regarding it as a move that will create continuing uncertainties about Brexit.
Distant_Evaluation	"Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""At one of the most pivotal moments for the UK economy in decades, it is unacceptable that Westminster politicians have chosen to focus on themselves, rather than on the needs of the country."

Main	The Federal Court of Appeal overturned on Thursday the Liberal government’s 2016 approval to expand Trans Mountain, a critical pipeline to link Canadian crude with foreign markets, followed hours later by Alberta’s tit-for-tat withdrawal from Trudeau’s climate plan.
Distant_Evaluation	The day’s events amplified criticism that Trudeau has failed to produce a regulatory system in which oil pipelines stand a chance of approval and undermined the PM’s ambitions to reduce emissions.
Distant_Evaluation	In short, they left him vulnerable to bleeding disappointed supporters on both his right and left, said Paul Thomas, professor emeritus at University of Manitoba.
Distant_Evaluation	“A lot was riding on the energy file,” Thomas said.
Distant_Evaluation	“There is no spin you can put on this that would be positive.”
Cause_General	At the heart of the centrist Trudeau’s plans for the economy and environment was a bargain with Alberta, Canada’s energy province.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Liberal government approval of Trans Mountain would provide Alberta oil producers with a larger export outlet to the British Columbia coast, and secure Alberta’s support of Trudeau’s national emissions plan.
Distant_Historical	Trudeau doubled down in May, agreeing to buy the faltering pipeline project for C$4.5 billion from Kinder Morgan Canada.
Main_Consequence	But Trudeau’s bargain collapsed with the court’s rejection and Alberta Premier Rachel Notley’s exit from the carbon plan.
Distant_Evaluation	Buying a pipeline was always unpopular with progressive voters, said Nik Nanos, head of polling firm Nanos Research.
Distant_Evaluation	“Now they run into double jeopardy politically because they have an issue of whether they can deliver.
Distant_Evaluation	And it’s having a knock-on effect on other issues, like carbon pricing.”
Distant_Evaluation	The party, which won a huge 2015 majority, is running close with the opposition Conservatives according to polls, and faces another risk in tough U.S. trade talks.
Cause_General	Trudeau on Friday said he could proceed with a national environment plan without Alberta’s support.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	His worst scenario would be to shed environment-minded voters to the New Democratic Party and economy-focused supporters to the Conservatives, while other Liberals stay home on voting day expected in October 2019, Nanos said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Such a scenario would weaken Trudeau in British Columbia and Quebec, potentially costing a second term, Nanos said.
Distant_Evaluation	To be sure, opposition leaders have struggled to connect with voters, making it harder to capitalize, Thomas said.
Distant_Evaluation	But there is no quick path either to resolving Trudeau’s pipeline-centered problems.
Cause_Specific	The court flagged regulatory agency the National Energy Board (NEB) for wrongly excluding a review of tanker traffic, and criticized Ottawa for failing to meaningfully consider indigenous concerns.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Trudeau could assemble a team to consult First Nations, and direct the NEB to produce a study of tanker traffic, said Richard Masson, executive fellow at the University of Calgary.

Distant_Evaluation	Accomplishing that and approving Trans Mountain again before the next campaign would be challenging, at a time when the Liberals are separately legislating tougher regulations for resource projects, Masson said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Appealing to Canada’s Supreme Court may be faster, said Robin Junger, a lawyer at McMillan Vantage dealing with environmental and aboriginal issues.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Trudeau’s best hope might be changing the political narrative altogether, Nanos said.
Distant_Evaluation	“In an ideal world, the Liberals would knock the pipeline off the news.”
Main	VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria’s right-wing government plans to shut seven mosques and could expel dozens of imams in what it said was “just the beginning” of a push against radical Islam and foreign funding of religious groups that Turkey condemned as racist.
Distant_Historical	The coalition government, an alliance of conservatives and the far right, came to power soon after Europe’s migration crisis on promises to prevent another influx and restrict benefits for new immigrants and refugees.
Distant_Historical	The moves follow a “law on Islam”, passed in 2015, which banned foreign funding of religious groups and created a duty for Muslim organizations to have “a positive fundamental view towards (Austria’s) state and society”.
Distant_Evaluation	“Political Islam’s parallel societies and radicalizing tendencies have no place in our country,” said Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who, in a previous job as minister in charge of integration, steered the Islam bill into law.
Distant_Evaluation	Standing next to him and two other cabinet members on Friday, far-right Vice Chancellor Heinz-Christian Strache told a news conference: “This is just the beginning.”
Cause_General	Austria, a country of 8.8 million people, has roughly 600,000 Muslim inhabitants, most of whom are Turkish or have families of Turkish origin.
Distant_Evaluation	Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s spokesman said the new policy was part of an “Islamophobic, racist and discriminatory wave” in Austria.
Distant_Evaluation	“The Austrian government’s ideologically charged practices are in violation of universal legal principles, social integration policies, minority rights and the ethics of co-existence,” Ibrahim Kalin tweeted.
Main	The ministers at the news conference said up to 60 imams belonging to the Turkish-Islamic Union for Cultural and Social Cooperation in Austria (ATIB), a Muslim group close to the Turkish government, could be expelled from the country or have visas denied on the grounds of receiving foreign funding.

Main	The White House on Sunday sought to increase pressure on Iran to return the 15 British sailors and marines it is holding, but took care to defer to Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has emphasized that he is seeking a diplomatic solution.
Main	''This is the type of unacceptable behavior that is just the latest in a long history from the Iranian government of bad actions it's taken, further isolating themselves from the international community,'' said Dan Bartlett, the White House counselor, during an appearance on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.''
Main	''The president remains a firm supporter of the position that the prime minister of the United Kingdom has taken in this, and we'll support them in any way they need us.''
Cause_General	Mr. Bartlett was speaking one day after President Bush spoke publicly on the situation for the first time.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Bush told reporters at Camp David on Saturday: ''The British hostages' issue is a serious issue because the Iranians took these people out of Iraqi water.
Distant_Evaluation	And it's inexcusable behavior.''
Distant_Evaluation	The president said, ''The Iranians must give back the hostages'' with no quid pro quos, adding, ''I strongly support the Blair government's attempts to resolve this peacefully.''
Cause_Specific	The Iranians took eight British sailors and seven marines into custody after intercepting them March 23 as they were seeking smugglers in a mission under United Nations auspices.
Cause_Specific	The Iranians charge that the Britons were illegally in Iranian waters, and Iran is seeking an apology.
Cause_Specific	The British say they were in Iraqi waters and have provided satellite images that they say prove it.
Cause_General	Mr. Blair and his government have appeared to try to isolate the situation from the broader context of the hostilities between its ally, the United States, and Iran.
Cause_General	And until Saturday, Mr. Bush had been keeping quiet, accordingly.
Distant_Evaluation	Iranian leaders have denied that the British military personnel were taken in retaliation for the detention of five Iranian officials in Iraq by the United States, who were suspected of providing weapons and money to extremist groups.
Distant_Evaluation	The White House's louder comments in the dispute this weekend came as the British made more conciliatory comments, with the British foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, saying that ''everyone regrets that this position has arisen'' and that ''what we want is a way out of it.''
Distant_Evaluation	Despite her comments, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran criticized Britain this weekend for failing to apologize.
Cause_General	On Sunday, 2,000 protesters clashed with the police as they marched on the British Embassy in Tehran, Iran's capital, throwing rocks and shooting firecrackers at it.
Cause_Specific	The government showed new video images of the prisoners pointing to a map, supposedly proving they had trespassed, with one sailor saying he understood the anger at the ''intrusion into your waters.''
Distant_Evaluation	British authorities have denounced the videos as coerced propaganda.

Distant_Evaluation	With an influx of more than 1.6 million asylum seekers into Germany since 2014, mainly from the Middle East and Africa, integration is a hot political issue for Chancellor Angela Merkel whose conservatives have lost ground to the far-right.
Cause_Specific	Hundreds of people have created organizations to help newcomers settle in and build ties, with efforts ranging from sports clubs and music groups that include migrants to recruitment agencies specializing in finding refugees work.

Distant_Historical	PREJUDICES
Distant_Historical	Petra Becker started Back on Track Syria in a refugee shelter in 2016, with Syrian teachers she recruited via Facebook giving lessons to 200 children, before moving to two of the city’s cultural centers.
Distant_Historical	Becker realized that young Syrians needed extra coaching after she struggled to get her own children into Berlin schools when her family returned from Damascus in 2012, where she had been working in the German embassy.
Distant_Evaluation	“Lots of headmasters whom I talked to, to get them into German school, had prejudices about the Syrian school system - they didn’t trust that they had enough knowledge to cope with school here,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Distant_Evaluation	“That made me wonder what happened to the children who didn’t speak German.”
Main	But Back on Track Syria runs on a shoestring budget, with scant government funding and no fees from parents.
Cause_General	Although Becker received business advice from a social enterprise accelerator, she still spends half of her time fundraising.
Distant_Evaluation	“Whenever we do workshops ... they tell us to take money from the parents, but they don’t have money,” she said.
Distant_Evaluation	“And if we did, they wouldn’t send their children anymore.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	She hopes to win a government contract to pay her bilingual volunteers to provide refugee children with the extra support they need to catch up with the curriculum and improve their German within ordinary schools.
Main	But the government is keen to rein in welfare costs as public anger toward migrants helped propel The Alternative for Germany (AfD) into parliament last year - the first far-right group to win seats in more than half a century.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lawyers for Sam Rainsy, who fled Cambodia in 2015 to escape a conviction for defamation he says was politically motivated, said he sought the information to help him in his own legal cases in Cambodia.
Cause_General	Supporters of Hun Sen have built a strong presence on Facebook.
Main	Sam Rainsy wants information on allegations of “false likes” on Hun Sen’s Facebook account, accusations that the platform had been used to make death threats and the use of state money for advertisements, his legal team said in a statement on Wednesday.
Distant_Evaluation	Government spokesman Phay Siphan said the lawsuit was “not useful”.
Distant_Evaluation	The case highlights the growing global nature of the challenge to Facebook Inc over its role in political debate after accusations that social media was used for meddling in votes in Britain, the United States and elsewhere.
Cause_General	Facebook has become an ever more important platform for political news in Cambodia as some media outlets critical of Hun Sen have been forced to shut.
Distant_Evaluation	Hun Sen, 65, has been criticized by Western countries over a ban on the main opposition party and the arrest of its leader less than a year away from a general election on July 29.
Main	Paris-based Sam Rainsy sought “critical information in Facebook’s possession regarding Hun Sen’s misuse of social media to deceive Cambodia’s electorate and to commit human rights abuses,” according to the statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“The petition raises fundamental questions about how Facebook should deal with human rights abusers who manipulate elections,” said Sam Rainsy’s attorney, Richard J. Rogers, of rights group Global Diligence LLP.
Cause_General	Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case, which Sam Rainsy’s lawyers said had been brought in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.
Distant_Evaluation	Hun Sen’s Facebook profile was private, the Cambodian government spokesman added.
Distant_Evaluation	“The Facebook profile of the Samdech Prime Minister is private, it’s not a terrorist group to cause any insecurity with any country,” said Phay Siphan, using the official title for Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for more than 33 years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Facebook, which has more than 2 billion users globally, tells advertisers they have the potential to reach 6.6 million people in Cambodia, from a population of nearly 16 million.
Cause_General	It says more than 5.5 million people have expressed an interest in, or liked, pages related to Hun Sen, of whom 1.8 million are in Cambodia.
Cause_General	Comparable figures for Sam Rainsy are 2.2 million people expressing an interest, with 1.7 million within Cambodia.

Main	WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Donald Trump tapped State Department Spokesperson Heather Nauert as the next U.S. envoy to the United Nations (UN), whose fairly blank resume in foreign policy may place tough challenges ahead for her, experts have said.
Distant_Evaluation	"Trump announced his decision on Friday, praising the 48-year-old spokeswoman as a ""very talented, very smart, very quick"" person who worked well with State Secretary Mike Pompeo."
Distant_Evaluation	"Trump administration senior officials, including Pompeo and the White House Spokesperson Sarah Sanders, voiced their support for Nauert, a longtime Fox News host before joining the State Department in April 2017, showing confidence that she will be ""a strong voice for the United States"" at the UN."
Distant_Evaluation	But picking Nauert, an Illinois native, to represent the United States at the international arena is seen by experts as an unorthodox choice, as the veteran news presenter had little political or foreign policy-making experience apart from her less-than-two-year tenure in the State Department.
Distant_Evaluation	"Choosing Nauert to succeed outgoing Nikki Haley showed that ""Trump values the external, outward-facing part of governance and diplomacy,"" Chris Galdieri, an associate professor at Saint Anselm College, told Xinhua."
Distant_Evaluation	For Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, loyalty serves as a key factor.
Distant_Evaluation	"""He (Trump) appointed her because of her personal loyalty to him and alignment with his foreign policy goals,"" West said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""She supports tougher U.S. engagement with the world,"" the researcher added."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	After Trump tapping her for the post, experts believe that Nauert may face a tough Senate confirmation hearing on her qualification.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The loudest opposition will come from Democrats,"" noted Galdieri, who believes that Nauert's almost total lack of diplomatic experience will be the most obvious weak point that the lawmakers won't let go."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Unlike Nikki Haley, she (Nauert) doesn't have a background in day-to-day politics to help her navigate the UN,"" Galdieri added."
Cause_General	Haley, a close Trump ally who announced her resignation in October, served two-term South Carolina governor before assuming the post as top U.S. diplomat at the UN.
Distant_Evaluation	Meanwhile, scholars also acknowledged that Nauert has her own strong points.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It is worth noting that she has now worked closely with two Secretaries of State over the past two years,"" Dan Mahaffee, senior vice president and director of policy at the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress, told Xinhua."
Distant_Evaluation	"Mahaffee also pointed out that the Trump administration's priority for the UN post should be ""an articulate spokesperson at a time when many of the debates before that body are reflecting a competition among ideals and worldviews."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With the Senate having a Republican majority, it will be able to confirm Nauert's nomination, said West.
Distant_Evaluation	However, even if confirmed, what's been waiting for Nauert at the UN was not an easy task.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Her (Nauert's) biggest challenge will be supporting Trump's policies at a time they are very contentious around the world,"" West observed."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Both friends and foes have doubts about the America First approach and it has driven wedges into many different foreign policy relationships,"" the expert added."

Main	LONDON, Dec. 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain could be plunged into a constitutional crisis if Prime Minister Theresa May loses her crucial Brexit vote on Dec. 11, a leading political academic told Xinhua on Sunday.
Cause_General	Lawmakers will start a marathon five-day debate on Tuesday on the withdrawal deal agreed between May and the European Council a week ago.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With up to 100 Conservatives MPs threatening to vote against the deal, it will plunge Britain's roller-coaster process of leaving the European Union (EU) into unchartered waters.
Cause_General	So far nobody knows what will happen if May loses the vote, with leading politicians and political commentators putting forward a range of post-vote scenarios.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They range from May seeking a modified deal from Britain, to her resigning as prime minister to let a new occupant of 10 Downing Street to take over the Brexit relay race, to a snap general election.
Main	"Professor Anthony Glees from the University of Buckingham told Xinhua in an exclusive interview: ""This is a political crisis which can, on Dec. 11, become a constitutional crisis if May loses, as all the experts believe she will do."
Main	"If it is not resolved properly and quickly it will explode into a crisis affecting everyone in the UK, old, young, rich, poor, employer and employee, the sick and the healthy."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The leader of the main opposition Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer, said in a Sunday morning television interview that his party will call for a confidence vote in May's government if she loses the vote, with a snap general election a possible outcome.
Cause_General	To add to May's political woes, opposition parties at Westminster are on the warpath over a government refusal to publish advice given about the Brexit withdrawal deal by the country's top legal officer, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Cox, who wrote the advice, will make a statement on Monday in the House of Commons on the advice he has given, with only a summary of the legal advice published.
Cause_General	The Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 MPs give May's minority government its slender majority, has accused the government of having something to hide by holding back on the full advice politicians have demanded.
Distant_Evaluation	Behind the row over the advice is a suspicion by some politicians that it explains the arrangements in the withdrawal deal over the fate of the post-Brexit border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic.
Cause_General	A permanent solution to maintaining a frictionless border between the two parts of Ireland has yet to be agreed by Britain and the EU.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The fear among some politicians is that a temporary border arrangement, which May insists would only be for a short time, could be in place indefinitely as it would need approval from the European Union to remove.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Sunday Times claims in a major report that Britain would be trapped indefinitely in a customs union with Brussels if MPs back May's Brexit deal.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""The government's top law officer ruled that the only way Britain could escape the backstop would be to sign a new trade deal, which could take years."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"But he warned Britain could remain trapped if those talks collapsed,"" said the newspaper."
Cause_General	Its report claimed the details have been confirmed to the newspaper by three serving cabinet ministers, including the former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who resigned recently because of his opposition to May's deal with the EU.
Distant_Evaluation	"On the last day of her visit to Argentina where she attended the G20 Summit, May said: ""The next nine days are a really important time for our country leading up to the vote on this deal."""
Cause_General	May has insisted she will press on with promoting her withdrawal agreement, saying it is the best deal for the country and respects the decision of the 2016 referendum when Britain voted to leave the EU.
Distant_Evaluation	She returned to 10 Downing Street Sunday to prepare for what will be one of the most important and intense periods in British politics in a generation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Meanwhile Glees, who is director of the Center for Security and Intelligence Studies at the University of Buckingham, said it seems inevitable May will lose on Dec. 11, with no more than 286 of the 650 MPs backing her, and the number of supporters decreasing on a daily basis.
Distant_Evaluation	May's withdrawal plan, said Glees, is a compromise which has split MPs in the House of Commons because it pleases neither side.
Distant_Evaluation	Glees acknowledged that despite what MPs say, nobody can be sure how they will vote on Dec. 11.
Distant_Evaluation	"On the question of what will happen, Glees told Xinhua: ""We are moving now into totally uncharted waters."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mrs May will probably want to try again if she loses on Dec. 11.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Perhaps a stock market and currency slump would focus Conservative MPs' minds on the need to support her a second time.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Perhaps she would dissolve Parliament and have a general election."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Glees says his understanding is that May believes the British people voted to quit the EU and if she does not achieve this it will destroy the Conservative Party.
Distant_Evaluation	"In a reference to the long standing Eurosceptic wing within the Conservative party, Glees said: ""The Brexiters have, after 40 years, finally won and May has to recognize that."
Distant_Evaluation	"At the same time, as a vicar's daughter, she genuinely wants not to harm ordinary British people."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Glees said if it ends in disaster for May, and she faces a confidence vote it could lead one of her ministers taking over as prime minister.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Or there could be an early snap general election and a new Labour leader, perhaps with my former Brunel student John McDonnell (Labour's Shadow Chancellor) in Downing Street."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Britain could then enter a long period of political and economic decline, ending in state socialism in our country or a period of rule by experts and security chiefs."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, it is also possible, believed Glees, that May will decide there needs to be a second referendum.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It is inconceivable that a government, or a political party that induced widescale economic collapse in the UK could survive,"" said Glees."
Cause_General	The latest YouGov poll, carried out for the People's Vote campaign, shows support for remaining in the EU at 55 percent, the highest level by the polling company since the 2016 referendum.
Main	BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr and Iranian-backed militia chief Hadi al-Amiri’s decision to choose compromise over confrontation and strike an alliance, aiming to form the next Iraqi government, has eased tensions after elections marred by fraud allegations.

Error	REUTERS/Alaa al-Marjani
Cause_Specific	Sadr’s bloc scored a stunning victory in the May 12 parliamentary election by tapping growing public discontent with neighboring Iran’s sway in Iraq and promising to deliver what past governments have not: jobs, better services and stability.
Cause_General	But beneath the surface there were fears that regional power Tehran, which before the vote said it would never let Sadr govern, would sabotage the mercurial cleric and set the stage for a showdown that could turn bloody.
Main	In the end, an alliance has emerged of strange bed-fellows: Sadr who portrays himself as a nationalist and Amiri, Iran’s most powerful ally in Iraq whose grouping came second.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Their choice of pragmatism has lowered the risk of violence among Iraq’s Shi’ite majority after a costly conflict war with the Sunni Muslim militants of Islamic State.
Cause_General	Sadr is treading cautiously, aware that Iran has manipulated Iraqi politics in its favor in the past and of Tehran’s vast sway in its most important Arab ally.
Distant_Historical	In a 2010 election, Vice President Ayad Allawi’s bloc won the most seats but he was prevented from becoming prime minister, blaming Iranian maneuvering.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If he (Sadr) insisted on fighting everyone at the same time he would be outmaneuvered, and the pressure of a re-run of the elections was too much,” said a Western diplomat in Baghdad.
Distant_Evaluation	Tehran, which has thrived amid Iraqi Shi’ite rivalries in the past by acting as a broker, has its own motivations.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Sadr’s alliance with Amiri, announced in the holy Shi’ite city of Najaf to project a sense of unity, gives Tehran more leverage over the formation of Iraq’s next government.
Distant_Evaluation	FEELING THE HEAT
Distant_Evaluation	Amiri, who spent two decades fighting Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein from Iran and speaks Farsi fluently, is one of the most powerful figures in Iraq.
Cause_General	His Badr Organisation controls the interior ministry and he played a decisive role in the battle against Islamic State.
Distant_Evaluation	“Amiri had the momentum behind him especially in this election, this is an opportunity for him,” said Hassan Hassan, senior fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.
Distant_Evaluation	“He is fresh off the field, very popular in some circles.”
Cause_General	Amiri is close to Major General Qassem Soleimani, commander of foreign operations for Iran’s Revolutionary Guards who has great influence in Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	Soleimani was in Iraq this week, a second Western diplomat in Baghdad said, adding that it is likely that he advised Amiri to ally with Sadr, who recently met Iran’s ambassador.
Distant_Evaluation	The Iranians have decided they must accept Sadr, the diplomat said, and he will have in turn realized he must work with Amiri to safeguard his victory.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Shunning Amiri could make life difficult for Sadr.
Distant_Evaluation	His foe, former Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, is still in the picture despite being forced out of office and widely blamed for Islamic State’s seizure of a third of Iraq.
Distant_Historical	In 2008, Maliki ordered a crackdown on forces loyal to Sadr in the Shi’ite heartland.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	According to the first diplomat who recently met Sadr, he felt pressured and feared his victory was going to vanish.
Distant_Evaluation	Acting on what Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said were widespread violations, a parliament stacked with lawmakers who failed to retain their seats mandated a nationwide recount.
Distant_Evaluation	Some politicians said the election should be repeated.
Distant_Evaluation	MIDDLE GROUND
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Abadi seemed to lose the most out of the alliance, diplomats and analysts said.
Cause_General	Even though he has balanced the interests of Iran and the United States, who compete for influence in Iraq, his bloc has yet to join any coalition.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He may yet win a second term as a compromise candidate, albeit as a much weaker premier, beholden to Sadr and Amiri.
Distant_Evaluation	Iran does not seem worried about the uncertainty but is under growing pressure to preserve its interests in the Middle East especially in Iraq.
Cause_General	U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of a nuclear deal with Tehran then engaged nuclear state North Korea, increasing Tehran’s isolation.
Error	Slideshow (2 Images)
Cause_General	In Yemen, Houthi forces aligned with Iran face the biggest offensive from a Saudi-led coalition in the three-year conflict, part of a regional proxy war between Riyadh and Tehran.
Distant_Evaluation	“There is a certain element of pragmatism in Iran on foreign policy,” said Renad Mansour, research fellow at Chatham House in London.
Distant_Evaluation	“Iran does not want Iraq to collapse but it also does not want Iraq to be too strong.
Distant_Evaluation	They want a middle ground.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Even if Sadr’s deal with Amiri succeeds, he may have to contend with grievances from members of his own bloc who insist Tehran would not be allowed to interfere in Iraqi affairs.
Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump demanded on Twitter on Sunday that the Justice Department look into whether his 2016 presidential campaign was infiltrated or surveilled by the agency or the FBI under the Obama administration.
Distant_Evaluation	Trump’s simmering anger over Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s year-old Russia probe appeared to spill over into a series of well-worn recriminations in several tweets, including that the investigation was politically motivated and had its roots in the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.
Cause_Specific	Federal investigators are looking into whether Russia tried to sway the election and if it worked with the Trump campaign to do so.
Distant_Evaluation	Trump has denied any collusion and repeatedly dismissed the investigation as a “witch hunt.”
Main	“I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!” Trump wrote on Twitter.
Distant_Evaluation	Trump also escalated his attacks on the Justice Department on Friday, suggesting that the FBI may have planted or recruited an informant in his 2016 presidential campaign.
Distant_Evaluation	He cited unidentified reports that at least one FBI representative was “implanted” for political purposes into his campaign.
Cause_General	Neither Trump nor Rudy Giuliani, a former New York mayor who is now one of Trump’s lawyers, provided any evidence of government infiltration into Trump’s presidential campaign.
Distant_Evaluation	Giuliani acknowledged in a CNN interview on Friday that neither he nor the president really knew if such action took place.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Giuliani was quoted by the New York Times later on Sunday as saying that Mueller had said the investigation would wrap up by Sept. 1.
Distant_Anecdotal	A source familiar with the probe called the Sept. 1 deadline “entirely made-up” and “another apparent effort to pressure the special counsel to hasten the end of his work.”
Cause_General	Related Coverage U.S. Justice Department asks watchdog to check for political motivations in FBI Russia probe
Distant_Anecdotal	“He’ll wrap it up when he thinks he’s turned over every rock, and when that is will depend on how cooperative witnesses, persons of interest and maybe even some targets are, if any of those emerge, and on what new evidence he finds, not on some arbitrary, first-of-the-month deadline one of the president’s attorneys cooks up,” said the source, a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Distant_Evaluation	UNSUBSTANTIATED ASSERTIONS
Distant_Historical	In September, the Justice Department said it had no evidence to support another of Trump’s unsubstantiated assertions: that Obama had ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential campaign.
Distant_Evaluation	It was unclear what kind of response Trump was seeking from the Justice Department this time, since investigations are kept secret and designed to be insulated from political influence and White House meddling.
Main_Consequence	A spokeswoman said the Justice Department had asked the Inspector General to expand a review of the process for requesting surveillance warrants to include determining whether there was impropriety or political motivation in how the FBI conducted its investigation.
Distant_Evaluation	Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, called Trump’s suspicion of an embedded spy “nonsense.” “His ‘demand’ DOJ investigate something they know to be untrue is an abuse of power, and an effort to distract from his growing legal problems,” Schiff said on Twitter.
Distant_Evaluation	In his earlier tweets on Sunday, Trump reprised his attacks on Hillary Clinton, his Democratic challenger in 2016, and maintained that Democrats were not submitted to the same FBI scrutiny.
Distant_Evaluation	Trump also implied that the special counsel investigation of whether foreign governments tried to influence the presidential campaign was designed to hurt Republicans in the November congressional elections.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party,” he wrote.
Distant_Evaluation	Trump, who has long complained the Russia probe has overstepped its bounds, referred to reports that his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., met in August 2016 with an envoy representing the crown princes of United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
Distant_Evaluation	The New York Times reported on Saturday the meetings were an indication that other countries besides Russia may have offered help to Trump’s presidential campaign.
Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House struggled on Wednesday to contain a political outcry and confusion over U.S. President Donald Trump’s summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, denying Trump ever meant to say that Moscow was no longer targeting the United States.
Cause_Specific	Trump, facing uproar over his failure to confront Putin over Russia’s 2016 U.S. election meddling, adopted his usual defiant posture two days after their Helsinki summit and called his critics deranged.
Cause_Specific	Asked by a journalist before a morning Cabinet meeting whether Russia was still targeting the United States, Trump looked at the reporter, shook his head and said, “No.”
Distant_Evaluation	At a later briefing, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the president was saying “no” to answering questions, not to the question itself.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	U.S. intelligence officials have said Russia’s efforts to undermine elections are continuing and now target the Nov. 6 congressional races.
Distant_Evaluation	Sanders said Trump believes the threat from Russia to undermine those elections still exists.
Distant_Evaluation	Asked later in an interview with CBS News whether he held Putin personally responsible for meddling in the 2016 election, Trump said he did.
Distant_Evaluation	“Well, I would, because he’s in charge of the country.
Distant_Evaluation	Just like I consider myself to be responsible for things that happen in this country,” he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Related Coverage Putin warns that U.S.-Russia nuclear treaty will expire unless action taken
Distant_Evaluation	The U.S. president said that in his talks with Putin, he was “very strong on the fact that we can’t have meddling, we can’t have any of that.” But Trump also appeared to question whether such statements would have an impact on Russia.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’re also living in a grown-up world,” he said.
Cause_General	Sanders explanation of Trump’s “No” was the second time since Monday’s summit that Trump and the White House have blamed a misstatement or misunderstanding for the furor over Russia.
Distant_Evaluation	On Tuesday, Trump said he misspoke at a Helsinki news conference with Putin and that he accepted intelligence agency conclusions about Russian election meddling, although he hedged by deviating from his prepared notes to say “it could be other people also.
Distant_Evaluation	There’s a lot of people out there.”
Cause_Specific	Trump stunned the world on Monday by shying away from criticizing the Russian leader for Moscow’s actions to undermine the election, sparking bipartisan fury at home and prompting calls by some U.S. lawmakers for tougher sanctions and other actions to punish Russia.
Distant_Evaluation	Critics have accused Trump of siding with Russia over his own country by failing to criticize Moscow for what U.S. intelligence agencies last year described as Russia’s election interference in an attempt to sow discord, aid Trump’s candidacy and disparage Trump’s Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.
Distant_Evaluation	Putin has denied the allegations.

Distant_Evaluation	“We’re doing very well, probably as well as anybody has ever done with Russia.
Distant_Evaluation	And there’s been no president ever as tough as I have been on Russia,” Trump said before the Cabinet meeting, adding that Putin “understands it and he’s not happy about it.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In a series of early morning Twitter posts, the Republican president said the summit would eventually produce “big results” and accused his critics of “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”
Distant_Evaluation	“Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia.
Distant_Evaluation	They would rather go to war than see this.
Distant_Evaluation	It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome!” the president wrote.
Distant_Historical	U.S. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats told a congressional committee in February he already had seen evidence Russia was targeting November’s elections when Republican control of the House of Representatives and Senate is at stake.
Distant_Evaluation	In rebutting Trump’s dismissive comments about U.S. intelligence on Monday, Coats said, “We have been clear in our assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy.”
Distant_Evaluation	Top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer said Trump needed to wake up to Russia’s efforts to interfere in American elections.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We won’t be able, as a nation, to fight back against foreign interference in our elections if the Commander in Chief doesn’t even acknowledge that it’s a real problem,” Schumer said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	Republican Senator John McCain accused Trump of “playing right into Putin’s hands” with the president’s comments in a Fox News interview on Tuesday that appeared to question the American commitment to defend all NATO allies.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They are very aggressive people, they may get aggressive, and congratulations, you are in World War Three.”
Distant_Historical	Montenegro joined NATO last year in defiance of Moscow after accusing Russian spies of orchestrating an attempted coup to derail the accession.
Distant_Evaluation	In his morning tweets, Trump said he elicited a promise from Putin during their meeting to help negotiations with North Korea, but did not say how.
Cause_General	Trump met North Korea’s Kim Jong Un in June and has since received a letter from Kim expressing hope for “practical actions” in the future as the United States seeking Pyongyang’s denuclearization.

Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration told lawmakers the U.S. government has reached a deal to put Chinese telecommunications company ZTE Corp back in business after it pays a significant fine and makes management changes, a senior congressional aide said on Friday.
Cause_General	U.S. President Donald Trump appeared to confirm the deal in a tweet late on Friday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine.”
Distant_Evaluation	The reported deal involving China’s second-largest telecommunications equipment maker ran into immediate resistance in Congress, where Democrats and Trump’s fellow Republicans accused him of bending to pressure from Beijing to ease up on a company that U.S. intelligence officials have suggested poses a significant risk to U.S. national security.
Cause_Specific	ZTE was banned in April from buying U.S. technology components for seven years for breaking an agreement reached after it violated U.S. sanctions against Iran and North Korea.. After ZTE makes a series of changes it would now be allowed to resume business with U.S. companies, including chipmaker Qualcomm Inc.
Main	The deal, earlier communicated to officials on Capitol Hill by the Commerce Department, requires ZTE to pay a substantial fine, place U.S. compliance officers at the company and change its management team, the aide said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Commerce Department would then lift an order issued in April preventing ZTE from buying U.S. products.
Cause_Specific	ZTE shut down most of its production after the ruling was announced.
Cause_Specific	Fox News said Trump told them on Thursday that he had negotiated the $1.3 billion fine with Chinese President Xi Jinping in a phone call.
Distant_Historical	ZTE, which is publicly traded but whose largest shareholder is a Chinese state-owned enterprise, agreed last year to pay a nearly $900 million penalty and open its books to a U.S. monitor.
Distant_Historical	The penalty stemmed from for breaking an agreement after it was caught illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran and North Korea, in an investigation dating to the Obama administration.
Cause_Specific	The company has lost over $3 billion since the April 15th ban on doing business with U.S. suppliers, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Cause_Specific	Trump on Tuesday floated a plan to fine ZTE up to $1.3 billion and shake up its management as his administration considered rolling back more severe penalties that have crippled the company.
Distant_Evaluation	Responding to news of the administration’s deal with ZTE, Republican Senator Marco Rubio tweeted: “Yes they have a deal in mind.
Distant_Evaluation	It is a great deal ... for #ZTE & China.
Distant_Evaluation	#China crushes U.S. companies with no mercy & they use these telecom companies to spy & steal from us.”
Distant_Evaluation	Rubio, as well as Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer and Chris Van Hollen, said Congress should act to stop Trump from letting ZTE get back into business.
Distant_Evaluation	“If the administration goes through with this reported deal, President Trump would be helping make China great again,” Schumer said Friday on Twitter.
Distant_Evaluation	“Would be a huge victory for President Xi, and a dramatic retreat by Pres Trump.

Distant_Evaluation	U.S. intelligence and U.S. law enforcement agencies have serious concerns that ZTE and other Chinese telecommunications firms use their equipment to gather intelligence on U.S. citizens.
Cause_Specific	The U.S. Department of Defense has also stopped selling ZTE’s mobile phones and modems in stores on its military bases, citing potential security risks.
Distant_Evaluation	William Evanina, the acting director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, said at his May 15 confirmation hearing that he would not use a ZTE phone nor recommend that anyone in a sensitive position in government use one.

Distant_Evaluation	MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s political and business leaders were quick to chalk up last week’s summit with U.S. President Donald Trump as a victory for Vladimir Putin.

Main	The rouble fell 1.2 percent on Tuesday after two U.S. senators said in a statement they had begun working on new sanctions that would, among other things, take aim at Russian sovereign debt.
Cause_General	It later recovered most of its losses.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While the sanctions proposed by Republican Lindsey Graham and Democrat Bob Menendez were seen by most political risk analysts as unlikely in the near term, new curbs contemplated by other U.S. lawmakers targeting the energy and metals sectors are more realistic, they say.
Distant_Evaluation	“There was hope that dialogue would start after the talks between Putin and Trump.
Cause_General	But the reaction inside the United States is blocking any dialogue,” said one billionaire included in January on a U.S. Treasury list of people deemed too close to the Kremlin, some of whom were later hit with sanctions.
Distant_Anecdotal	“The threat of wider sanctions has grown,” the businessman told Reuters, declining to be named because of the subject’s sensitivity.
Distant_Evaluation	Russian business people had hoped the Helsinki meeting, the first between the two presidents, would pave the way for a possible thaw in relations and delay, if not stop, the preparation of more sanctions which have followed thick and fast since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea.
Distant_Evaluation	Instead, anger about what some U.S. lawmakers saw as a too-deferential performance by Trump in Helsinki and his failure to publicly confront Putin over Moscow’s alleged meddling in U.S. politics may have made things worse.
Distant_Evaluation	In a country where state media portrays Putin as a seemingly infallible leader, even some of his supporters were fretting that he may have made an error by appearing to demonstrably take Trump’s side.
Distant_Evaluation	In Helsinki, Putin said for the first time that he had wanted Trump to win the 2016 U.S. presidential election and after the summit complained about political forces in the United States trying to undermine the meeting’s outcome.
Distant_Evaluation	Sergei Markov, a longtime Putin supporter and former lawmaker for the ruling United Russia party, wrote on social media after the summit that the Russian president had outplayed Trump in Helsinki “by a big margin”, but added:
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“...
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In doing so he created a problem because he exposed his partner to fierce criticism in the United States.”
Distant_Evaluation	Putin should have given Trump the chance to tell U.S. media that he had extracted concessions from him in a “giveaway game”, staying focused on the longer-term goal of stabilizing ties between Moscow and Washington, Markov said on his Facebook page.
Distant_Anecdotal	‘SELLING RUSSIA’
Distant_Evaluation	Instead, Putin appeared dominant while Trump was deemed by U.S. critics as overly friendly to Russia and possibly even treasonous when he gave credence to Putin’s denials of meddling in the 2016 election despite U.S. intelligence findings to the contrary.
Distant_Evaluation	Many Republicans joined Democrats in criticizing Trump’s performance.
Main	With an eye on U.S. mid-term elections in November, a bipartisan group of senators is pushing the “DETER Act” legislation putting Putin on notice that his country would be hit with more U.S. sanctions if Russia interferes in future polls.
Distant_Evaluation	It was unclear how quickly that and other proposals could advance with U.S. Congress’ summer recess looming.
Distant_Evaluation	But the business and financial community in Russia is still worried.
Distant_Anecdotal	“The only outcome of this so far is that people are selling Russia,” said one state banker.
Distant_Anecdotal	“All liquid (Russian) securities are now hostage to geopolitics, which strongly depend on what goes on in the United States.”
Distant_Evaluation	Mitigating that risk would be tricky, business people said.
Distant_Anecdotal	“You can’t keep your assets in roubles because the rouble is linked to the dollar and if there will be more sanctions the rouble will suffer,” said one businessman, asking not to be named because he didn’t want to be linked with sanctions risk.
Distant_Anecdotal	“You can’t hold them in dollars because of sanctions.
Distant_Anecdotal	That leaves holding euros in private banks which is frightening (because Russian private banks can be unstable), U.S. Treasuries if you can get them, and other low risk assets,” he said.
Distant_Anecdotal	“In short, nobody is expecting anything good to happen.”

Distant_Evaluation	Dmitri Trenin, a former colonel in the Russian army and director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, agreed it might have been better for Putin to have adopted an approach of “strategic patience” with the United States, but said it was not too late.
Distant_Evaluation	“The first détente in the hybrid war between Russia and the West was ... nipped in the bud by Trump’s behavior and the vehemence of his domestic critics.
Distant_Evaluation	So be it,” Trenin wrote in an article published on the center’s website after the summit.
Distant_Evaluation	“Moscow’s strategy should now be one of patience, leaving America and Europe to their own devices and focusing on relations with countries far more relevant to its future: Asia and the Middle East.”

Distant_Evaluation	“We’re not in America,” Alexander Gauland, one of two co-leaders of the anti-immigrant party, told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain in an interview published on Saturday.
Distant_Evaluation	“The interests of the anti-establishment parties in Europe are quite divergent,” he added in comments that amounted to a blunt rebuff to Bannon from one of Europe’s most influential far-right parties.
Cause_Specific	The former Trump strategist last month announced he had created a Brussels-based political organization called The Movement to rally nationalist and populist voters in European Parliament elections next May, with a goal of undermining and paralysing the bloc.
Main	But Gauland said that while his co-leader Alice Weidel had met once with Bannon, he saw no possibility of cooperating with him.
Main	“Mr Bannon will not succeed in forging an alliance of the like-minded for the European elections.”
Cause_General	He said the AfD only had close contacts with Austria’s far-right Freedom Party (FPO), junior party in Austria’s coalition government.
Cause_General	Former AfD leader Frauke Petry had always wanted to work with France’s National Front, but that had not worked out.
Distant_Evaluation	Raheem Kassam, a spokesman for The Movement, said of Gauland’s comments: “The Movement is a clearing house of ideas, not a campaigning organization that would seek to have anything to do with AFD’s national policy or election campaigns.
Distant_Evaluation	We are content that senior AFD figures understand the project and are in touch with us every day.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	We look forward to working alongside those who want to do so, for the causes we all believe in.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Gauland told Funke Mediengruppe that his party was polling at 17 to 20 percent in recent surveys, and its support could grow beyond that as long as Chancellor Angela Merkel remained in power.
Distant_Historical	The party won 12.6 percent of the vote in national elections last September, making it the third largest party and catapulting it into the German parliament for the first time.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Gauland said the AfD needed to become stronger, but he expected it to be ready to take on a governing role in the medium-term.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Political experts say the party could become the strongest party in the eastern German states of Saxony and Brandenburg in regional elections next year, raising the question of whether mainstream parties will reverse course and agree to form coalitions with it.

Cause_General	Dubbed the ‘millennials party’, the PSI is an upstart on the political stage of this Southeast Asian nation that hopes to tap into young voters’ contempt for the entrenched corruption and divisive identity politics of the ruling elite.
Distant_Historical	The downfall of long-serving autocrat Suharto in 1998 - amid a crisis widely blamed on a culture of nepotism and graft - brought an end to a regime of repression.
Cause_General	But two decades later, the 190 million voters of the world’s third-largest democracy are still asked to choose from a crowd of candidates who began their political careers during that period.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The 2019 presidential election looks set to be a repeat of 2014, when current leader Joko Widodo narrowly defeated Prabowo Subianto, an ex-armed forces general who was formerly married to a daughter of Suharto.
Main	The PSI is one of four new parties the General Election Commission is allowing to contest next year’s legislative and presidential elections.
Main	Two of the new parties are fronted by establishment figures.
Main	The United Indonesia Party (Perindo) is headed by U.S. President Donald Trump’s business partner in Indonesia, Hary Tanoeseodibjo, while the Berkaya Party is led by Suharto’s youngest son, Tommy, who advocates a return to the “New Order” values of his late father.
Distant_Evaluation	PSI leader Grace Natalie, a former television journalist, believes the time has come for a new generation of politicians who would be genuinely accountable to the people.
Cause_General	Her party interviews members seeking nomination for a seat in parliament, and live-streams the discussions on social media platforms.
Cause_General	Teachers, corporate lawyers, doctors and bankers are among those whose interviews have aired on Facebook and YouTube.
Distant_Evaluation	“No other party is offering what we are in terms of transparency,” she told Reuters at PSI’s headquarters - referred to by party staff as “base camp” - where a wall poster urges “Make Art, Not War”.
Cause_General	CRITICAL DEMOGRAPHIC
Distant_Historical	Natalie, a 35-year-old mother of two toddlers, set up PSI in 2014, determined to offer an alternative for young voters.
Cause_General	It’s a critical demographic with people between the ages of 17 and 25 accounting for about 30 percent of the electorate.
Cause_General	Two-thirds of the party’s roughly 400,000 members are under 35.
Cause_General	PSI relies on crowdfunding and donations to run operations across the vast archipelago of Indonesia, and to keep costs down it works from members’ houses and uses donated vehicles.
Distant_Evaluation	“This way, no one person can claim that they own the party.
Distant_Evaluation	Everyone is contributing something,” said Natalie, who was educated in Jakarta and the Netherlands, and speaks proficient English.
Distant_Evaluation	So far, PSI has raised 2.6 billion rupiah ($180,000), a tiny sum compared to the coffers of mainstream parties that benefit from poor enforcement of laws limiting political donations.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It will also struggle to get traction with the youth it is targeting.
Cause_General	While the size of the youth vote bank has swelled from 18 percent of total voters in 2004 to 30 percent in 2014, the participation of young voters has dwindled.
Distant_Historical	Data from the elections commission showed less than half of voters between 17 and 29 years old cast a ballot in 2014 legislative elections compared with around 90 percent among those over 30.
Cause_General	Ella Prihatini, a researcher at the University of Western Australia, in a survey of 253 young voters, found many of them were uninterested in politics.
Distant_Evaluation	“On parliament, the dominant answer from respondents was that their MPs are not actually representing them, so why bother voting?” Prihatini said.
Distant_Evaluation	POLITICAL ISLAM
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Winning support is also likely to be particularly challenging for Natalie, an ethnic-Chinese Indonesian, in a climate of religious and ethnic tensions.
Distant_Evaluation	Indonesia is a secular country but concerns are growing about the Islamisation of politics in the world’s largest Muslim-majority country.
Distant_Historical	Jakarta’s former governor, an ethnic-Chinese Christian, was ousted last year after hardline Muslim groups organized massive protests over allegations he insulted Islam.
Distant_Historical	He was later jailed for blasphemy.
Main	The 14 parties contesting next year’s polls include the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), which leads the ruling coalition, several other secular parties as well as rising Islamic-oriented parties.
Distant_Evaluation	Natalie, who plans to run for parliament next year, conceded she and PSI need a far bigger budget to win support in rural areas, home to nearly half of Indonesia’s population.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Her party will back Widodo - a popular moderate reformer - for re-election as president rather than try to field a candidate of its own.
Distant_Anecdotal	Ibrahim Irsyad Hasibuan, a 20-year-old journalism student from Tangerang outside Jakarta, said young voters are apathetic because they have no faith in the political system, and so PSI could be a wake-up call for his generation.

Main	ISLAMABAD, April 18 (Xinhua) -- Two more children died on Wednesday in Pakistan's southern district of Tharparkar due to various reasons, taking the total death in the region for similar cases to 177 so far this year, local media reported quoting government hospital sources.
Cause_Specific	All the deaths have been occurred due to malnutrition and the outbreak of multiple viral infections in Tharparkar, a district in the country's Sindh province, said doctors at the government hospital.
Cause_General	According to the statistics released by the Health Department of Sindh, 55 children died due to the similar viral infections and malnutrition in January, 45 died in February, and 56 in March.
Cause_General	At least 21 infant deaths have been reported in April so far.
Cause_General	Furthermore, at least 1,500 children die each year due to malnutrition, viral infections and lack of proper medical facilities in the remote region of the province, said the health department.

Cause_Specific	The murder of Jan Kuciak has rattled Prime Minister Robert Fico’s three-party government and led to public anger about corruption in Slovakia, which is a member of the European Union.
Distant_Evaluation	Fico was quick to reject any shake-up, saying it would undermine the result of elections in 2016.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	President Andrej Kiska lacks formal powers to trigger the fall of the government but his comments could add to public pressure on it.
Cause_General	On Friday, thousands of people marched in the capital Bratislava and other cities for Kuciak, 27, who had been looking into suspected mafia links among Italian businessmen in eastern Slovakia before he was found shot dead with his fiancee Martina Kusnirova last weekend.
Cause_General	One of the men named in Kuciak’s last report had past links to people who subsequently worked for Fico’s office.
Cause_General	The report was published posthumously and probed potential abuse of EU subsidies and other fraud..
Distant_Evaluation	Kiska said in a live televised address that Slovakia faced a “crisis of trust”.
Main	“I will start talks with political leaders on how they imagine the future ... and how to renew the trust of people in their own state,” he said.
Main	He then advocated “an extensive and essential” remake of the government or a snap election.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Fico said any government changes must be agreed by coalition partners.
Distant_Evaluation	“The constitution sees no role for president in this process,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“Our goal is the investigation of this brutal act.
Distant_Evaluation	We won’t dance on the graves of two young people, unlike opposition, media and, now, the president.”
Distant_Evaluation	The leader of junior government member Slovak National Party, Andrej Danko, said afterward he was ready for dialogue.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Junior coalition Most-Hid (Bridge) party gave the interior minister until March 12 to resign or it may consider withdrawing its support for the government.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If Fico resigns, the government also falls.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Kiska would then task the outgoing prime minister to rule until a new government is formed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Early elections can be triggered with the support of three fifths of lawmakers.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The government can also ask for a confidence vote in parliament, where a simple majority among present lawmakers would suffice.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Thirty lawmakers can also trigger a no-confidence motion, for which an absolute majority — at least 76 votes in the 150-seat parliament — are needed.

Error	REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst
Distant_Evaluation	The current U.S. president is like few – if any – other leaders in American history.
Distant_Evaluation	He reportedly shows little interest in reading briefing documents, spends much of his time on the golf course or watching cable television – all the while disagreeing with the Washington establishment on just about everything.
Distant_Evaluation	After 14 months in the Oval Office, however, it’s hard to dispute that he is becoming more successful at marrying his idiosyncratic style with the levers of power to get his own way.
Main	Tuesday’s ousting of Secretary of State Rex Tillerson suggests Trump’s confidence is still growing – as is his ability to use the power of his office.
Cause_General	The two have clearly been at odds for some time, with Tillerson failing to deny reports last year that he had called Trump a “moron.” Trump’s announcement of his plan to replace Tillerson with CIA Director Mike Pompeo comes days after Trump’ decision to tell a South Korean envoy that he was willing to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Distant_Evaluation	(Tillerson later said the decision was “not a surprise” although its suddenness prompted speculation he wasn’t consulted in advance.)
Distant_Evaluation	Whether Trump is acting wisely is a matter of division and debate.
Distant_Evaluation	On North Korea, many foreign policy experts say he is making a mistake by starting with a summit.
Distant_Evaluation	With tariffs, Trump essentially signaled a trade war with a tweet, again with little of the policy or diplomatic consultations that would normally precede such a step.
Distant_Evaluation	On gun control, the administration has ensured that Trump’s personal – if controversial – thoughts on arming teachers are a focus of the discussion, and perhaps new legislation.
Distant_Evaluation	His tax cuts are at the center of U.S. economic policy.
Distant_Evaluation	Immigration policy remains largely deadlocked, but Trump is unquestionably setting the tone and agenda.
Distant_Evaluation	It’s unclear how much success Trump will have pushing his views into law.
Distant_Evaluation	All are intensely polarizing.
Distant_Evaluation	But then, that may be partly the point.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Even if he fails to get his way, most of these views can be expected to energize his political base ahead of the November midterm elections – a significant bellwether for his prospects of re-election in 2020.
Distant_Evaluation	His surprise policy pronouncements also provide temporary distraction from prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probe into allegations that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, an investigation where the president holds no control – to his clear frustration and fury.
Distant_Evaluation	That the 45th POTUS is settling into the role should hardly be a surprise – all leaders in all nations go through a similar process, and Trump has never lacked for self-confidence.
Distant_Evaluation	Still, the administration has become better at managing the initially chaotic and sometimes vicious battles within it.
Distant_Historical	As late as last year, Trump’s Twitter feed and public pronouncements were a hodgepodge, some barely followed up, which often played badly in the media; his May 2017 appearance at a NATO summit in Europe was a particularly unsuccessful example.
Distant_Evaluation	More recently, however, he has used Twitter more strategically, often to issue surprise announcements or to shape the political battlefield on issues such as trade and taxes.
Distant_Evaluation	The administration has also become more disciplined at following such utterances through.
Distant_Evaluation	That includes forcing others to embrace his “deal-making” persona, as South Korea did unashamedly in presenting him with Kim’s offer of a summit.
Distant_Evaluation	Friend and foe alike know they must flatter him to progress, even if political constraints and personal taste mean they do not always do so.
Distant_Historical	When he ran his business, Trump was said to operate through a very narrow group, often keeping them in a state of intense and insecure rivalry.
Distant_Historical	The main outlet for his need for public attention was his “Apprentice” reality show, with its slogan “You’re Fired” designed around that concept.
Distant_Historical	The model did not serve the presidency well, as its first months last year demonstrated.
Distant_Evaluation	The president is clearly frustrated that he cannot simply dictate whom he has around him.
Distant_Evaluation	The departure of White House communications director Hope Hicks may be a particular blow.
Cause_General	Alongside daughter Ivanka, she was one of only a handful to follow him across from his business empire.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The appointment of former U.S. Marine general John Kelly as White House Chief of Staff last year clearly ushered in a more ordered era, although tensions continue amid talk that Kelly and National Security Adviser H.R.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	McMaster may also leave.
Distant_Evaluation	By some measures, turnover within the Trump administration – particularly of White House political appointments – has been the highest of any recent presidency.
Distant_Evaluation	That has often been a reflection of either personal disagreements or embarrassing revelations, such as former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn’s admission that he had lied to the FBI about contacts with the Russian government after Trump’s election.
Distant_Evaluation	Still, others survived sometimes spectacular spats – replacement Attorney General Jeff Sessions is one example – and for the most part they appear to have exercised autonomy in the running of their departments.

Distant_Evaluation	Mattis in particular has been allowed to show notable independence – perhaps a sign of the president’s famed respect for military authority.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In declaring Mattis its “person of the year,” the Financial Times wrote that one of the few reasons the world could sleep at night was that Trump would have to go through the former Marine if he wished to launch a unilateral strike on North Korea.
Distant_Evaluation	That may or may not be an accurate judgment.
Distant_Evaluation	More broadly, though, this year gives the lie to any suggestion that the president is restrained by those about him.
Cause_General	The North Korea meeting is the latest in which Trump has used the limited but real capabilities of his office to dictate policy, regardless of protocol and what others might think.
Distant_Evaluation	He is finding his feet – and no doubt wondering where next to take them.

Main	Vizcarra called for a popular vote not just to fast track judicial reforms, but also to gauge support for a ban on private financing of political campaigns, an end to the reelection of lawmakers and the creation of a second chamber in Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	The proposal is Vizcarra’s latest attempt to distance himself from a political class widely seen as corrupt, following the resignation of the former president in March and a cronyism scandal that has roiled the justice system in recent weeks.
Distant_Evaluation	“My government is making a decided bet on strengthening the state as a whole in order to defeat the criminal and corrupt mafias that feed off our country,” Vizcarra said before Congress in his first Independence Day speech since taking office four months ago.
Distant_Evaluation	“We need the input of all citizens.
Distant_Evaluation	That’s why we’re convinced that a referendum is healthy for our democracy.”
Cause_General	It was unclear if Congress would give the green light needed for the referendum to be called.
Cause_General	Without backing from lawmakers, Vizcarra would have to collect hundreds of thousands of voters’ signatures.
Distant_Evaluation	The head of the opposition party, Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of former authoritarian leader Alberto Fujimori, called for reflection.
Distant_Evaluation	“Let’s remember that only in democracy and with respect for institutionality can we institute true change,” Fujimori said on Facebook.
Cause_General	Vizcarra did not propose a date for the referendum.
Cause_General	But Peruvians will go to polls later in October to select mayors, governors and other local officials in regional elections.
Distant_Evaluation	A former vice president and governor of a small mining region, Vizcarra vowed to fight corruption “at any cost” when he took office to replace Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, who resigned the presidency to avoid impeachment on graft and vote-buying allegations he denied.
Cause_General	Since then, a second crisis has gripped the nation of 32 million people as local media have published a stream of phone conversations that appear to show judges trading favors with businessmen, lawmakers and the country’s new attorney general.
Distant_Evaluation	Thousands of Peruvians have taken to the streets in recent weeks to protest systemic graft, with many calling for fresh elections.
Cause_General	A majority of Peruvians now disapprove of Congress, the government, the judiciary and prosecutors, according to a recent Ipsos poll.
Distant_Evaluation	“This crisis has reached a breaking point,” Vizcarra said.
Distant_Evaluation	“That’s why, as president of the republic, I’ve decided, with the support of the citizenry, to lead a change long sought by honest Peruvians.”

Main	The Genocide Convention is preventive at its core, and punishes specific acts that are committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, he said.
Cause_General	These acts include killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; and forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.
Main	Preventing genocide means paying close attention to these provisions, said Guterres.
Main	"""Tragically, the international community has sometimes failed to heed the warning signs and take early and decisive action."
Main	"Rather than preventing genocide, we are still reacting to it, often too late."""
Cause_General	Since the end of World War II, the international community has failed to prevent genocide in Cambodia, Rwanda, and Srebrenica in the former Yugoslavia, he noted.
Main	In the past two decades, the world has at least started to hold perpetrators to account, he said.
Cause_General	The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and the Extraordinary Chambers in the Courts of Cambodia have all convicted perpetrators for the crime of genocide.
Main	The work of these courts reflects a welcome resolve to punish perpetrators of genocide, he said.
Distant_Historical	The UN General Assembly in September 2015 designated Dec. 9 as the International Day of Commemoration and Dignity of the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the Prevention of this Crime.
Cause_General	Dec. 9 is the anniversary of the adoption of the 1948 Genocide Convention.
Cause_General	The Genocide Convention was the first human rights treaty adopted by the United Nations.
Main	It embodies a collective determination to protect people from brutality and to prevent the repetition of the horrors witnessed by the world during World War II, said Guterres.
Cause_General	The convention has been ratified or acceded to by 149 states; 45 member states have not become party to it, noted Guterres.
Main	"""I urge those 45 states to consider becoming party as an urgent priority."
Main	"Universal participation will send a unifying signal of resolve in this 70th anniversary year."""
Cause_General	He also called on those states that are already parties to the convention to back their commitments with action.
Main	"""Preventing and punishing genocide is the duty, the responsibility and the obligation of the entire international community."""
Cause_General	Guterres deplored the fact that 70 years after the adoption of the Genocide Convention, people are still being killed, raped, their homes torched, their lands confiscated -- just because of who they are.
Cause_General	In Iraq, the violent extremists of the Islamic State brutally targeted the Yazidi people for murder, sexual slavery and trafficking.
Main	Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar were systematically killed, tortured, raped and burnt alive, victims of what has rightly been called ethnic cleansing, said Guterres.
Main	Elsewhere around the world, racism, hate speech, violent misogyny, anti-semitism, Islamophobia and all forms of xenophobia are on the rise, he said.
Main	"""We now know that dehumanizing language is not only evil in itself."
Main	"It may also sow the seeds for far more evil acts, including genocide."""
Main	It is incumbent on all people, individually and collectively, to reject every single attempt to target people because of their nationality, ethnicity, religion or race, or any other form of identity, he said.
Cause_General	The UN chief encouraged people to speak out and help nurture the courage and the political will to act decisively, at the right time, and to support others when they take action.
Main	"""My generation believed that after the Holocaust, we would never see genocide again."
Main	"We were wrong,"" said Guterres."
Main	"""Modernity does not protect us from genocide."
Main	The digital age does not protect us from genocide.
Main	"Nothing but our own actions, based on our values and principles, can protect us from genocide."""
Main	The Genocide Convention offers an essential legal framework for efforts to fight this crime, he said.
Main	BRASILIA (Reuters) - Steadfast support for jailed former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in Brazil’s poor northeast may give a former governor from the region an edge in the search for the leftist icon’s substitute, three Workers Party officials told Reuters this week.

Main	Jaques Wagner, a former governor of Bahia state and a minister under Lula and his successor Dilma Rousseff, is gaining ground and could displace former São Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad as the party’s likely presidential candidate in the October election, the sources said.
Cause_General	They requested anonymity to speak freely about internal deliberations.
Main	The evolving debate in the Workers Party suggests that Lula, the most influential Brazilian politician of the past two decades, and allies may be coming around to the idea of transferring his support rather than having him mount his own campaign from jail.
Cause_General	Lula, whose eight years in office saw millions of Brazilians lifted from poverty, is still Brazil’s most popular politician despite several corruption indictments and a conviction that will most likely bar him from running.
Distant_Evaluation	Lula’s spokesman Jose Crispiniano denied that the Workers Party was moving on.
Distant_Evaluation	“Ex-president Lula da Silva is the candidate and there is no discussion of a substitute,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“The party is not evaluating any hypothesis other than Lula’s candidacy,” said a Workers Party spokesman.
Cause_General	Wagner and Haddad declined to comment.
Cause_General	While Lula, 72, started his political career as a union leader in São Paulo’s industrial belt, his greatest support today is in his native northeast, where his policies contributed to dramatic improvements in social conditions since the turn of the century.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Behind bars since April, serving a prison sentence for his bribery conviction, Lula has insisted he will run in October.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Yet the party insiders said the reality is setting in that his candidacy may soon be struck down by the electoral court.
Distant_Evaluation	“His priority today is more Jaques.
Distant_Evaluation	Not to deny Haddad’s merits, but Wagner has more political experience and, being from the northeast, he could start out with considerably more voter support,” said one of the party officials.
Distant_Historical	The 67-year-old Wagner, whose parents were Jewish immigrants from Poland, is a founding member of Lula’s Workers Party and was Rousseff’s defense minister before her 2016 impeachment for breaking budget rules.
Cause_General	Wagner is under investigation for allegedly taking bribes in the building of the World Cup soccer stadium in Bahia’s capital of Salvador during his time as governor from 2007 to 2015.
Distant_Evaluation	He has denied any wrongdoing.
Cause_General	Haddad, 55, of Lebanese Christian descent, lost his 2016 bid for re-election to São Paulo’s city hall in a stunning first-round defeat to rising conservative star João Doria, who is now running for governor of São Paulo state.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Haddad’s relative youth and distance from the major corruption scandals roiling Brazilian politics bolstered expectations that he could be the most likely stand-in for Lula.
Distant_Evaluation	Still, his resounding 2016 defeat and lack of a connection with the party’s northeastern base has raised concerns.
Distant_Historical	Wagner was slapped down by party leaders earlier this year for proposing that they find a candidate outside their ranks to avoid disaster in the October general election.
Cause_General	He has since insisted that Lula should run.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	One of the sources said Wagner may now give in to inside pressure to be the party’s candidate.
Main	Democratic leaders said Tuesday that they intended to hold symbolic votes in the House and Senate on President Bush's plan to send more troops to Baghdad, forcing Republicans to take a stand on the proposal and seeking to isolate the president politically over his handling of the war.
Cause_Specific	Senate Democrats decided to schedule a vote on the resolution after a closed-door meeting on a day when Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts introduced legislation to require Mr. Bush to gain Congressional approval before sending more troops to Iraq.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Senate vote is expected as early as next week, after an initial round of committee hearings on the plan Mr. Bush will lay out for the nation Wednesday night in a televised address delivered from the White House library, a setting chosen because it will provide a fresh backdrop for a presidential message.
Main	The office of Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House, followed with an announcement that the House would also take up a resolution in opposition to a troop increase.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	House Democrats were scheduled to meet Wednesday morning to consider whether to interrupt their carefully choreographed 100-hour, two-week-long rollout of their domestic agenda this month to address the Iraq war.
Distant_Evaluation	In both chambers, Democrats made clear that the resolutions -- which would do nothing in practical terms to block Mr. Bush's intention to increase the United States military presence in Iraq -- would be the minimum steps they would pursue.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They did not rule out eventually considering more muscular responses, like seeking to cap the number of troops being deployed to Iraq or limiting financing for the war -- steps that could provoke a Constitutional and political showdown over the president's power to wage war.
Cause_General	The resolutions would represent the most significant reconsideration of Congressional support for the war since it began, and mark the first big clash between the White House and Congress since the November election, which put the Senate and House under the control of the Democrats.
Distant_Evaluation	The decision to pursue a confrontation with the White House was a turning point for Democrats, who have struggled with how to take on Mr. Bush's war policy without being perceived as undermining the military or risking criticism as defeatists.
Distant_Evaluation	''If you really want to change the situation on the ground, demonstrate to the president he's on his own,'' said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''That will spark real change.''
Cause_General	The administration continued Tuesday to press its case with members of Congress from both parties.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	By the time Mr. Bush delivers his speech, 148 lawmakers will have come to the White House in the past week to discuss the war, White House aides said Tuesday night, adding that most met with the president himself.
Cause_General	While Mr. Kennedy and a relatively small number of other Democrats were pushing for immediate, concrete steps to challenge Mr. Bush through legislation, Democratic leaders said that for now they favored the less-divisive approach of simply asking senators to cast a vote on a nonbinding resolution for or against the plan.
Distant_Evaluation	They also sought to frame the clash with the White House on their terms, using language reminiscent of the Vietnam War era to suggest that increasing the United States military presence in Iraq would be a mistake.
Distant_Evaluation	''We believe that there is a number of Republicans who will join with us to say no to escalation,'' said the Senate mority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''I really believe that if we can come up with a bipartisan approach to this escalation, we will do more to change the direction of that war in Iraq than any other thing that we can do.''
Cause_General	On the eve of the president's Iraq speech, the White House sent Frederick W. Kagan, a military analyst who helped develop the troop increase plan, to meet with the Senate Republican Policy Committee.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But Republican officials conceded that at least 10 of their own senators were likely to oppose the plan to increase troops levels in Iraq.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And Democrats were proposing their resolution with that in mind, hoping to send a forceful message that as many as 60 senators believed strengthening American forces in Baghdad was the wrong approach.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Democratic leaders said they expect all but a few of their senators to back the resolution.
Distant_Evaluation	In an interview on Tuesday, Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, said he was becoming increasingly skeptical that a troop increase was in the best interest of the United States.
Distant_Evaluation	''I'm particularly concerned about the greater injection of our troops into the middle of sectarian violence.
Distant_Evaluation	Whom do you shoot at, the Sunni or the Shia?''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Warner said.
Distant_Evaluation	''Our American G.I.
Distant_Evaluation	's should not be subjected to that type of risk.''
Distant_Evaluation	But the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, said Congress could not supplant the authority of the president.
Distant_Evaluation	''You can't run a war by a committee of 435 in the House and 100 in the Senate,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	The White House press secretary, Tony Snow, criticized the Democrats' plans.
Distant_Evaluation	''We understand that the resolution is purely symbolic, but the war -- and the necessity of succeeding in Iraq -- are very real,'' he said Tuesday night.
Cause_General	On Thursday, Democrats in the House and Senate will open a series of hearings on the Iraq war.
Cause_General	Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice are among those who have agreed to testify.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who is the new chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said that if he was not satisfied that Mr. Bush's plan has sufficient incentives and penalties for the Iraqis, he might support a resolution or amendment to cap the number of American troops in Iraq.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''We have got to force the Iraqis to take charge of their own country,'' Mr. Levin said at a breakfast meeting with reporters.
Distant_Evaluation	''We can't save them from themselves.
Distant_Evaluation	It is a political solution.
Distant_Evaluation	It is no longer a military solution.''
Distant_Evaluation	Lawmakers said Senate Democrats appeared broadly united in opposition to Mr. Bush's approach during their private luncheon on Tuesday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While there were a few senators who favored cutting off money for any troop increase, a handful of others expressed uncertainty about challenging the president on a potential war-powers issue.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''We have to be very careful about blocking funding for any troops because we don't want to leave our troops short-changed,'' said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana.
Distant_Evaluation	Yet a large share of the House Democratic caucus supports a stronger stance against the plan.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It remained unclear whether a resolution would satisfy constituents.
Cause_General	''Twice in the past 12 months the president has increased troop levels in a last-ditch effort to control the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Iraq,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, Democrat of Massachusetts, who proposed a resolution opposing a troop increase.
Distant_Evaluation	''Rather than cooling tensions in Baghdad, the situation has descended further into chaos.''

Main	TOKYO, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, winning the ruling party's leadership election Thursday, will likely to become Japan's longest-serving leader, but underwhelming support shown by rank-and-file party members may spell difficulties ahead for both party and president, political analysts said.
Cause_General	In the leadership race, Abe's only opponent was former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba who in the run-up to the election voiced different views to Abe on constitutional reform and economic policies and ended up mounting a far-bigger challenge to the incumbent than expected.
Distant_Evaluation	Local political observers pointed out that while Abe has secured the top party post for a third-consecutive term, effectively ensuring his position as the nation's next prime minister owing to the ruling coalition's majorities in both chambers of parliament, Ishiba garnering far more support than expected from rank-and-file members has certainly raised some red flags looking ahead.
Cause_Specific	While Abe won 329 out of ballots cast by Diet members, and 224 by rank-and-file members, Ishiba secured 73 votes from legislators but an unexpected 181 votes from ordinary members, who closely reflect public opinion.
Distant_Evaluation	This, political analysts said, was to a certain extent down to increasing opposition to the prime minister's long reign amid ongoing cronyism allegations, ineffectual economic policies and the railroading through parliament of contentious legislation, including those related to security, to push forward his constitutional reform agenda.
Distant_Evaluation	"The underwhelming support in the leadership election, described by political watchers here as a ""backlash"" by the LDP's rank-and-file members, is ""most certainly"" reflected in public opinion, specialists in politics and national ideology have maintained."
Distant_Evaluation	"""People have begun to feel weary of slogan-only and deceptive politics and Abe's style of the privatized use of public power and hawkish stance toward diplomacy and East Asian international relations,"" Dr. Shin Chiba, professor with Special Appointment, who specializes in political theory, said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Abe, following his victory, was quick to reiterate his plans to forge ahead with his career goal of revising the nation's Supreme Law for the first time since World War II, having controversially and against public and constitutional experts' opinions redefined the role of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) three years ago, to allow it to take part in collective-self defense and come to the aid of an ally under attack, even if its own territory is not threatened.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Henceforth, Abe will thus seek to secure the two-thirds majority needed in both houses of parliament and a majority in a national referendum to bring about his legacy-led revisions to the constitution, which will specifically make reference to the SDF and ""purportedly"" clear up its current constitutional ambiguity."
Distant_Evaluation	However, as recent polls have suggested, the Japanese public are far more concerned about the dire fiscal health of the nation, rather than the prime minister's singular goal of revising the Supreme Law for the first time since it took effect in 1947.
Distant_Evaluation	Abe's reasons for constitutional reform are both personal and political.
Distant_Evaluation	He is a long-time devotee of constitutional reform and has used geopolitical pretexts to push forward his reforms, noted Tina Burrett, Associate Professor of Political Science at Sophia University.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The public are split on the issue of reform... for most voters, however, the economy and public services are far more important issues,"" she said."
Distant_Evaluation	Her sentiments have been echoed by other experts on the matter, with Yu Uchiyama, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo, believing Abe's constitutional agenda is far from a straightforward one, with a public mandate on the issue possibly going awry.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Even if Abe manages to force a revision through parliament, he would face a referendum, raising the prospect of a Brexit-style political meltdown if the people vote against him,"" Uchiyama said."
Distant_Evaluation	With public support for the premier and his Cabinet tepid at best amid myriad cronyism scandals and economic malaise perpetrated by a vastly unclear blueprint as to how to deal with the nation's ballooning social welfare costs related to its rapidly aging and shrinking society, security issues are currently not a public priority, political experts have attested.
Distant_Evaluation	Christian Collet, from International Christian University's Politics and International Relations faculty maintained that the Japanese populace believe that Article 9 of Japan's pacifist charter, that states that Japanese people forever renounce war and that land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained, despite Abe's aspirations, should remain as is.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Significant segments of the public will continue to resist the efforts to revise Article 9 and there is near unanimous opposition to Japan becoming a nuclear power,"" the expert said."
Distant_Evaluation	"With Abe only gaining about 55 percent of all votes at the local level in the leadership election, members in the ruling camp have been quoted as saying the figures were ""shocking,"" particularly as they closely reflect public opinion."
Distant_Evaluation	"LDP party members have also said that the worse-than-expected voting numbers could suggest that victory in the upper house election slated for the summer of 2019 might not be a shoo-in for the ruling camp, with an LDP executive describing the outcome of the leadership vote as ""a revolt from the local regions."""
Distant_Evaluation	Criticism is now swirling within the ruling party following Thursday's presidential election, reflecting rising dissent from factions within the party based on the lack of support for Abe staying at the helm from the party's own rank-and-file members, sources close to the matter said.
Distant_Evaluation	People both support and don't support him (Abe) at the same time, said Masao Matsumoto, professor in the Social Survey Research Center at Saitama University, highlighting the political and public divide.
Distant_Evaluation	And, Abe's sole rival in the leadership race was of the same opinion, in terms of both the ruling party and its leader and a growing lack of cohesion.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""The presidential election demonstrated the LDP is not of one color,"" Ishiba told a press briefing after the vote, underscoring the fact that the road ahead for the party and its president is, indeed, a bumpy one."

Main	LONDON, Oct. 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Theresa May stole the show as she brought the four-day Conservative Party Conference to a close Wednesday in Birmingham.
Distant_Historical	A year ago everything that could go wrong did go wrong, with May struggling to make her speech because of a throat infection, and suffering of the platform backdrop falling apart.
Cause_General	"Dancing onto the stage to the tune of Swedish pop group ABBA's hit ""Dancing Queen"", May mocked herself, jokingly saying if she lost her voice it was because she had been up half of the night super gluing the stage set."
Distant_Evaluation	"Though Labour MP Angela Rayner described the dance with the hashtag cringe, Scottish National Party MP Joanna Cherry said May's dance was ""an affront to my favorite song""."
Distant_Evaluation	Media commentators, usually ultra-critical of leaders' speeches, hailed her plucky performance and her speech.

Distant_Anecdotal	Ends conference on a high, cements her position as leader.
Distant_Anecdotal	But nothing has changed.
Distant_Anecdotal	"The Brexit reckoning is delayed."""
Distant_Evaluation	The Guardian's summary was that political commentators had generally been very positive, with some thinking it's her best yet.
Distant_Evaluation	Although, added the Guardian, there is quite a lot of skepticism about whether she can deliver.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In her speech, May promised to deliver the Brexit the British people had voted for and there would be no referendum or people's vote -- laid into the prospect of a Labour government led by its leader Jeremy Corbyn.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	She announced local councils would be free to borrow as much as they wanted too for a massive social house building program.
Distant_Evaluation	She also threw in that a decade of austerity was finally over for Britain.
Cause_General	The auditorium packed with Conservative Party loyalists gave her a standing ovation before heading home with a message in their ears that Britain must remain united as it plans its life away from the European Union (EU).
Distant_Evaluation	Political opponents, however, were not as enthused as Conservative supporters of May.
Distant_Evaluation	"Labour's Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell, said: ""Theresa May's claim that austerity is over is a con."

Distant_Evaluation	"""Austerity is not an economic necessity."
Distant_Evaluation	It is a political choice made by the Conservatives to hack away at our public services and communities, leaving workers worse off while gifting huge tax cuts to big business.
Distant_Evaluation	"And as long as Britain has a Conservative prime minister, we'll never see an end to austerity."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Vince Cable, leader of the minority Liberal Democrats said: ""As somebody who takes dancing seriously, I was delighted to see Theresa May show that she is developing her new hobby."
Distant_Evaluation	"But she was dancing on the head of a pin, confronted by an audience full of people plotting to oust her."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Cable said that May said the Conservatives must be a party for the whole country, adding ""yet she has overseen widening divisions in our society."
Distant_Evaluation	"Trapped by the rabid ideologues of the Conservative right-wing, Mrs May has been driven to illiberal extremes on Brexit, welfare and immigration."""

Cause_Specific	Morrison’s Liberal Party, the senior partner in a Liberal-National coalition, fractured in August when a backbench revolt forced then prime minister Malcolm Turnbull from office in a party-room vote, ushering in Australia’s sixth leader in 10 years.
Cause_General	His first session of parliament as leader was hostile but Morrison’s government united to defeat a series of motions by the opposition Labor party to debate Turnbull’s ousting that would have amounted to a confidence vote.
Distant_Evaluation	The coalition lost its a majority of only one seat in parliament with Turnbull’s resignation in August, leaving it precariously placed to push ahead with its agenda and hold off calls for an early election.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Given the public mood and the circumstances behind Turnbull’s departure, there was the very real prospect that some backbenchers would have moved against the government in order to bring about an election,” said Haydon Manning, a Flinders University political science professor.
Distant_Evaluation	The impact of the political infighting has been laid bare in recent days despite Monday’s fragile show of unity.
Cause_Specific	Australia’s prominent Newspoll in The Australian newspaper on Monday showed the coalition would lose up to 30 seats if an election was held now.
Cause_Specific	The poll of 1,653 voters showed Labor ahead by 56 to 44 on a two-party-preferred basis in which votes for minor parties are distributed under preference deals.
Cause_General	It was the 40th straight losing poll for the coalition and a sharp deterioration from the 51-49 result in the last days of Turnbull’s leadership.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The government will soon face a by-election for Turnbull’s harbourside Sydney electorate and the Newspoll indicated the once-safe Liberal seat could be in jeopardy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A defeat would leave Morrison beholden to a group of independent lawmakers.
Distant_Evaluation	The Liberals already had a stark warning in a New South Wales state by-election where official figures on Sunday showed a massive 29 percent swing against them.
Distant_Evaluation	NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian blamed the chaos in Canberra for turning people against the party.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Morrison has used his first few weeks in office to present a down-to-earth image with a message of a “fair go for those who have a go” but could struggle to keep the government unified.
Cause_General	Australia’s upper house Senate, where the government also doesn’t have a majority, passed a bill on Monday that would ban the export of live sheep following a series of animal cruelty cases.
Cause_General	Morrison, who relies on the support of rural voters, opposes the ban but several of his backbenchers have vowed to support the legislation.
Cause_General	He also faces growing calls to address allegations of bullying within his party after allegations from three female backbenchers that they were unduly pressured by supporters of Peter Dutton, whose challenge brought on the leadership vote.

Cause_General	Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and a senior White House adviser, also attended the meeting in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building along with Trump's acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.
Cause_General	They were negotiating with senior staff for congressional Democratic leadership.
Distant_Evaluation	"Nielsen briefed the negotiators on the situation on the U.S.-Mexico border, according to the readout, adding that the Democratic side ""requested further details in writing on the needs"" of her department."
Distant_Evaluation	"Trump dug in on his proposal again Saturday morning, tweeting that ""we are working hard at the Border, but we need a WALL!"""
Distant_Evaluation	The president said Friday after meeting with congressional Democratic leaders that he was prepared for a partial government shutdown to last for months or even years if they don't agree to provide funding for border security, including the wall.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He also signaled a possibility of using emergency powers to build the wall without congressional approval and necessary funds.
Cause_General	House Democrats passed a spending package earlier this week, including a stopgap bill to keep the Homeland Security Department funded at the current level until Feb. 8, and measures to fund the eight other cabinet departments affected by the shutdown through Sept. 30, the end of the fiscal year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, those measures are unlikely to be taken up by the Republican-held Senate or be signed by Trump as they do not provide money for Trump's border wall.
Main	The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has estimated that the Army has enough budget flexibility to pay for its military operations through July in the event that a standoff between the White House and Congress over Iraq holds up the money the administration says it needs for the war effort.
Main	The service's report, made public Friday by Senate Democrats, said the Pentagon may have to shift money between accounts and curtail some nonessential activities, but said Congress has provided the military with new ability to do so, lessening the potential for disruptions until additional money is approved.
Cause_General	Democrats quickly seized on the findings by the service, which is the research arm of Congress, to defend their handling of the legislation to pay for military operation in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Cause_General	But the administration stepped up its efforts to accuse them of delaying money and putting American forces at risk.
Distant_Evaluation	The back-and-forth suggested that both sides are digging in for a pitched public relations battle over who bears responsibility for holding up the money, should Mr. Bush veto it because of Congressionally imposed timelines for withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Cause_General	At the White House, Dana Perino, a spokeswoman for the president, took Congress to task for leaving on an Easter break without finishing a final bill to pay for operations through Sept. 30.
Distant_Evaluation	''The president was surprised to learn that Congress went on vacation today and that the House didn't bother to appoint any conferees in which to help try to reconcile the differences between the Senate and the House bills,'' she said.
Distant_Evaluation	''And so I don't know how much work is going to be able to get done while they're away.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said the report showed that the administration was overstating the potential impact on the military to try to force Congress to back down on the legislation, which would establish a schedule for bringing troops out of Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	''This study confirms that the president is once again attempting to mislead the public and create an artificial atmosphere of anxiety,'' Mr. Reid said.
Distant_Evaluation	''He is using scare tactics to defeat bipartisan legislation that would change course in Iraq.''
Main	The document, dated Wednesday, said that based on Pentagon figures and estimates, the Army now has enough money to last through May.
Main	If it uses its ability to redirect money, the Army could support both its regular operations ''and war program for almost two additional months or through most of July 2007,'' an analyst for the research service said in the report for the Budget Committee.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Senior Army officials said their estimate now is that ways can be found to pay for combat operations through the third week of June.
Distant_Evaluation	These Army officials stressed that their planning was based on prudent management and not meant to influence the political debate between the White House and Congress.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In a letter sent this week to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, Gen. Peter J. Schoomaker, the Army chief of staff, and Pete Geren, the acting Army secretary, said that without new money in April, the Army would ''be forced to take increasingly draconian measures which will impact Army readiness and impose hardships on our soldiers and their families.''
Main	While the Congressional Research Service document said the Army could keep money flowing to Iraq through midsummer, it acknowledged there would be costs associated with the financial juggling.
Main	''In order to ensure that funding is available for the later months of the year, the Army may very well decide that it must slow down its non-war-related operations before money would run out by, for example, limiting facility maintenance and repairs, delaying equipment overhauls, restricting travel and meetings, and perhaps slowing down training,'' the analysis said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At the Pentagon, officials stressed that turning to special budget tools to guarantee money for troops in combat would be more expensive and inefficient.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The first crunch period would come by the end of May, should the impasse not be resolved, when money in the accounts that pay for military operations and maintenance would be exhausted.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If that were to happen, Army officials said, units preparing to go to Iraq would not have enough money to undertake all of the required training.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Since no units are sent into combat until certified, units now in Iraq would have to extend their tours until money was available to fully train fresh units.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If the budget impasse drags past the end of May, then Army and Pentagon officials could redirect money from other accounts -- such as personnel -- to pay for the war effort.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In that case, the Army would make its requests to the secretary of defense, who would seek the endorsement of the White House's Office of Management and Budget.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But Congressional approval would be required for money to be transferred between accounts, and that process could take weeks.

Cause_General	ATF-Romania is composed of approximately 135 Canadian Armed Forces personnel and five CF-18 Hornets.
Cause_General	It is Canada's third ATF deployment to Romania on Operation REASSURANCE.
Distant_Historical	The first was from April to August 2014 to the Romanian Air Force 71st Air Base in Campia Turzii, and the second was from September to December 2017 to Constanta.

Main	BRASILIA, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro expressed doubts on Friday over the merger between Brazilian aviation company Embraer and U.S. company Boeing, which has been in talks since last year.
Distant_Evaluation	At a press conference at Brasilia's air base held after the inauguration of the new commander of Aeronautics, Bolsonaro said that the latest proposal, presented in December, could affect the interests of Brazilians, but did not go further into detail.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It's our heritage."
Distant_Evaluation	"We know of the need of this merger, for its (Embraer's) competitiveness, so it doesn't disappear over time,"" said Bolsonaro, who was sworn in as Brazil's president on Tuesday."
Cause_General	The proposed merger between Embraer and Boeing would include the commercial aviation area of Embraer and associated services, in which Boeing has an 80 percent share and Embraer has 20 percent.
Cause_General	During the final days of former president Michel Temer's government last month, the Finance Ministry was notified of the merger, with a period of 30 days to contest the legality of it.
Main	The legal opinion will be up to the Attorney General's Office of National Treasury, and the government will make a decision on the basis of the opinion.
Cause_Specific	"Although Embraer was privatized in 1994, the Brazilian government owns a special ""golden share"" which gives it veto power on important decisions, such as the transfer of control of the company, interruption to the provision of military aircraft parts, and a change of its name."
Cause_General	Founded in 1969, Embraer is a world leader in regional aircraft manufacturing.
Main	Barely a year after parliamentary elections, Ukraine has lurched toward a new political crisis as President Viktor A. Yushchenko's support among lawmakers hemorrhages and he faces new calls to dissolve Parliament, now led by his rival, Prime Minister Viktor F. Yanukovich.
Main	Mr. Yushchenko's beleaguered party, Our Ukraine, has organized a public protest against the parliamentary majority for Saturday, along with some of the president's erstwhile supporters who increasingly fear that the pro-Russian Mr. Yanukovich is growing too powerful.
Cause_Specific	By Friday, protesters were already gathering in Kiev, the capital, as were counterprotesters loyal to Mr. Yanukovich.
Distant_Evaluation	Those who want Parliament disbanded complain that with the lawmakers and the president at odds, the country has been at a stalemate.
Distant_Evaluation	One result is that the country has been unable to pass anticorruption and banking laws to speed Ukraine's economic growth.
Distant_Evaluation	''If there is a president in the country, if the president loves Ukraine and respects Ukrainians, if the president understands all the dangers facing the country, he will either dissolve the Parliament or lose the remaining support of society,'' Yulia V. Tymoshenko, once Mr. Yushchenko's prime minister, said Friday, the Russian news agency Interfax reported from Kiev.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Yushchenko, who leans toward the West, became president after the ''Orange Revolution'' in the fall of 2004 overturned a fraudulent vote that initially gave the presidency to Mr. Yanukovich.
Distant_Evaluation	A renewed confrontation between the men has been brewing almost from the day last August that Mr. Yanukovich formed enough of a coalition in Parliament to become prime minister.
Cause_General	Now awkwardly sharing power, the two men have agreed on some broad economic and social policies but have differed sharply over foreign policy, especially Mr. Yushchenko's goal of having Ukraine join NATO and the European Union.
Distant_Evaluation	Under Mr. Yanukovich's leadership, Mr. Yushchenko's opponents have carved away at the president's already diminished powers.
Cause_General	Parliament dismissed his foreign minister, for example, and refused to confirm his first choice as a successor.
Cause_General	In the past week, some of Mr. Yushchenko's supporters in Parliament have defected to Mr. Yanukovich's coalition, most prominently Anatoly K. Kinakh, who was a leader of Our Ukraine and the president's former national security adviser.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Yanukovich's Party of Regions now leads a coalition with 260 of the 450 seats and boasts that it may soon have 300, a veto-proof two-thirds majority.
Distant_Evaluation	On Thursday, Mr. Yushchenko denounced the coalition, saying it no longer represented the results of last year's parliamentary elections, in which no party won a majority.
Distant_Evaluation	He said the law forbids elected lawmakers to switch parties and called Parliament's actions unconstitutional.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	His remarks were his clearest suggestion yet that he may call new elections.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Supporters of a new vote hope that Mr. Yushchenko and his former allies in the Orange Revolution will be able to put aside their differences and join together to win a majority.

Main	WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department announced on Friday that it has filled in a key position in fighting the Islamic State (IS) following an abrupt resignation of a senior official in protest against U.S. troops withdrawal from Syria.
Main	James Jeffrey, the current U.S. Special Representative for Syria Engagement, will take on the additional role of the Special Envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS (IS) after the departure of Brett McGurk, said the department's deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino in a statement.
Cause_Specific	McGurk resigned from the post late December following the White House's decision to exit U.S. troops from Syria.
Cause_Specific	The withdrawal plan also prompted the resignation of former U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis.

Main	WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- The 116th U.S. Congress officially convened Thursday noon, with Democrats taking control of the House and Republicans remaining their majority in the Senate.
Main	Democrats have a 235-199 majority in the House, with one seat still in dispute after allegations of election fraud in the state of North Carolina.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, is expected to be elected as House speaker.
Cause_General	The House is holding a roll call vote on Pelosi's speakership.
Cause_General	Vice President Mike Pence, who also serves as the president of the Senate, swore in new members of the upper chamber, where 53 Republicans hold the majority over 45 Democrats and two independents aligning with Democrats.
Cause_General	The new Congress convened amid a partial shutdown of the federal government, now in its 13th day over an impasse between the White House and the Congress about funding for President Donald Trump's long-promised border wall.
Distant_Evaluation	"The House is expected to hold a series of votes aimed at ending the shutdown but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday that he had made it clear to Pelosi that the Republican-controlled Senate were not interested in Democrats' ""show votes."""
Cause_General	The new Congress also seats a record number of female lawmakers and is the most racially and ethnically diverse, including a new generation of Muslims, Latinos, Native Americans and African-Americans.
Main	STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven lost a no-confidence vote in parliament on Tuesday, with the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats threatening to block any new government unless they are given a say in policy.
Cause_General	The rise of the far right across Europe has forced many traditional parties into an uncomfortable choice of sharing power with populist forces or reaching out to long-standing opponents to keep them out.
Cause_General	Sweden, long seen as a bastion of liberal values and political stability, now faces the same choice with its center-left and center-right blocs evenly balanced after the Sept. 9 election and the Sweden Democrats holding the balance of power.
Distant_Evaluation	“Now the excitement will really start,” said Ulf Bjereld, political scientist at Gothenburg University.
Distant_Evaluation	“The parties will have to show their true colors now.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Sweden Democrats have been shunned by all other parties since entering parliament in 2010, making any tie-up unlikely.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But if there is no viable government after four attempts by the speaker, then a new election would have to be called within three months, with the main parties likely to face a similar dilemma again.
Cause_General	Voters delivered a hung parliament in the Sept. 9 election when Lofven’s center-left bloc won 144 seats, one more than the center-right opposition Alliance.
Cause_General	The Sweden Democrats, a party that has its roots in the white supremacist fringe, got 62 seats and backed the Alliance in Tuesday’s vote, which was an obligatory test of the prime minister’s parliamentary support after an election.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A new government could take weeks or months - as was the case in Germany and Italy - to thrash out.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The speaker will start discussions with party leaders on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	“VERY COMPLEX”
Main_Consequence	After Lofven’s ousting, the speaker of parliament is now seen turning to Ulf Kristersson, leader of the biggest Alliance party, the Moderates, to try to form a new administration.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But lacking a majority, Kristersson needs support either from the Sweden Democrats, who want to freeze immigration and a vote on membership of the European Union, or the center left.
Error	Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven speaks to the press, after he was ousted in no-confidence vote, in Stockholm, Sweden September 25, 2018.

Distant_Evaluation	Neither choice looks viable.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If the Alliance parties choose to try to govern as the smallest bloc, then they make themselves totally dependent on the Sweden Democrats,” Lofven said.
Cause_General	The Sweden Democrats want a voice on immigration, welfare and crime policies as the price for supporting a new government.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We will do everything in our power to stop any attempt to form a government, do everything to bring down every government, which does not give us a reasonable influence in proportion to our electoral support,” SD party leader Jimmie Akesson said.
Cause_General	The Alliance of the Moderates, Centre, Liberal and Christian Democrats has said it will not negotiate with the party.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Nevertheless, Moderate leader Kristersson said his chances of forming a government were good “for the simple reason that voter support for an Alliance government is much stronger than that for any other government”.
Distant_Evaluation	“But, I am very conscious of the fact that the situation in parliament is very complex,” he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The only other alternative, support from the center left, has been ruled out by Lofven, who is hoping for another shot at being prime minister himself.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	An Alliance government has only “slim chances” of being formed, Linnaeus University political scientist Magnus Hagevi said.
Cause_General	Despite the uncertainty, markets barely reacted on Tuesday.
Cause_General	Sweden’s economy has enjoyed strong growth for years and government finances are strong.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Economic policy is unlikely to shift radically under a new government and there is broad agreement about the need to tackle structural problems in areas such as housing and the labor market.
Distant_Evaluation	The crown has strengthened since the election.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If Kristersson fails to form a government, the speaker could turn once more to Lofven, still the leader of the biggest party in parliament, the Social Democrats, who have dominated Swedish politics for decades.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I want to lead a government that has broader support in the country’s parliament and that allows us to leave stalemate of bloc politics,” Lofven said after the no-confidence vote.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lofven hopes that the aversion the Centre and Liberal parties have for the Sweden Democrats will outweigh the political differences they have with his Social Democrats.

Distant_Evaluation	NEW YORK, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- The majority of the estimated 800,000 New York city (NYC) residents living below the poverty line who were originally promised half-price Metrocards may not be able to receive the benefit, according to the city's Comptroller office.
Main	New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the launch of Fair Fare program on Friday, saying that more than a hundred thousand New Yorkers are about to have the doors of opportunity opened for them thanks to the program.
Cause_General	"""Our subway system began in 1904 and there has never been a time where low-income New Yorkers received discounted service,"" said de Blasio."
Main	Using the Fair Fares MetroCard, eligible New York City residents may buy either an unlimited 7-day or 30-day pass for 16 U.S. dollars or 60.5 dollars respectively.
Main	During the first phase of the program, Fair Fares MetroCards will be available to about 25,000 New Yorkers who are existing clients of the NYC Department of Social Services.
Cause_General	These individuals will receive letters informing them of their eligibility.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	By mid-2019, the city expects to offer an additional 170,000 New Yorkers with lower incomes the chance to participate in Fair Fares NYC.
Cause_General	Only New York City residents are eligible to participate in this program.
Distant_Evaluation	However, NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer said in a press release that as the city significantly scaled back initial eligibility to just a small subset of Cash Assistance and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients, two of the city's social service programs, a majority of poor people will continue to face a significant financial burden to purchase a MetroCard.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Hundreds of thousands of families will still struggle to get to work or a job interview because they can't afford a full fare."
Distant_Evaluation	"For their sake, we need to make sure this delay doesn't become a derailment,"" said Stringer."
Cause_General	The federal poverty line stood at 25,100 dollars for a family of four.

Distant_Historical	She was the House speaker from 2007 to 2011 when her Democratic Party controlled the lower chamber.
Cause_Specific	For her second speakership, Pelosi defeated Republican nominee Kevin McCarthy in a roll-call vote Thursday, winning 220 votes out of a total of 430 present, according to CNN.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"In her floor speech upon accepting the speaker's gavel, Pelosi said that the House floor must be ""America's Town Hall"" where people's voices will be heard and affect lawmakers' decisions as she was trying to set a bipartisan tone for the new Congress."

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Democrats will be offering the Senate Republican appropriations legislation to re-open government later today,"" Pelosi said."
Cause_General	About a quarter of the federal government shut down last month as a result of an impasse between the White House and the Congress over whether to provide billions of U.S. dollars for President Donald Trump's long-promised border wall.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Pelosi said in a clip airing on MSNBC on Wednesday that she's willing to give ""nothing for the wall,"" while Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the upper chamber won't consider any bills without the president's support."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Christopher Galdieri, assistant professor at Saint Anselm College, told Xinhua that he expects ""the shutdown fight to continue take up most of the oxygen"" in Washington."
Cause_General	The convening of the new Congress also comes at a time when Pelosi and her party are poised to confront the White House and the Republican agenda with their House majority, as Democratic lawmakers have vowed to conduct more oversight onto the Trump administration.
Cause_General	An effective legislator and political strategist, Pelosi played a key role in last year's midterm elections that saw Democrats seize control of the House for the first time in eight years by helping raise millions of dollars for Democratic candidates and keep them focus on the issue of health care on their campaign trails.

Cause_General	A UK Cabinet Office spokesperson said a ban on one company bidding for government contracts would not be lawful.
Cause_General	“Public sector procurement rules require that bids are evaluated based on specific requirements and selection criteria,” the spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Cause_General	“For any major contracts this includes a test to see whether the bidding company has the economic and financial standing to undertake the contract”.
Cause_General	Interserve had no immediate comment when contacted by Reuters.
Cause_General	Shares in Interserve lost more than half their value on Monday after the company announced a rescue plan that envisaged converting much of its debt into new shares, potentially handing control of the company to its creditors.

Main	New York, Jan. 5 (Xinhua) -- New York City has raised its minimum wage to 15 U.S. dollars an hour this year in an effort to fight against poverty.
Main	The new minimum wage, which is set at 15 dollars per hour for all businesses with 11 employees or more, went into effect on the last day of 2018.
Main	For businesses with 10 employees or less, the minimum wage they have to pay is 13.5 dollars per hour.

Main	KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni on Sunday warned against foreign interference in the country’s politics days after an opposition call for the United States to suspend military aid over the government’s human rights record.
Cause_General	Museveni also accused some unnamed foreign countries of seeking to influence the nation’s politics by funneling assistance to the opposition through non-governmental organizations.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is important that external players refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries,” Museveni told a press conference on Sunday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If there’s any problem in Uganda, I surely will handle it better than the outsider.”
Cause_Specific	Last week the U.S. lawyer for opposition lawmaker Robert Kyagulanyi, a musician known by his stage name Bobi Wine, called on the United States to stop funding Uganda’s military as a punitive measure against what Kyagulanyi said was torture by authorities in his country.
Cause_Specific	Kyagulanyi and fellow parliamentarian Francis Zaake say they were tortured by security forces while in detention in August.
Cause_General	The case led to protests against Museveni.
Cause_General	Kyagulanyi, who has emerged as a formidable threat to the president, was charged with treason over his alleged role in the stoning of Museveni’s convoy during campaigning for a parliamentary seat.
Distant_Evaluation	The government in Kampala denies torturing Kyagulanyi.
Cause_General	In power since 1986, Museveni has been widely accused by opposition critics and rights campaigners of using security forces to suppress opposition to his rule.
Distant_Evaluation	“NGOs (non-governmental organizations) funded by foreign governments actually give money to opposition players, give advice, lie on their behalf,” Museveni said.

Distant_Evaluation	MIAMI, the United States, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- On Sunday morning, many residents in south Florida were not woken by alarm, but by the sound of the howling wind that managed to penetrate even the toughest buildings.
Main	Just after 9 a.m. local time (1300 GMT), the U.S. National Hurricane Center announced that Category Four Hurricane Irma finally made landfall in the Florida Keys, after a week of anticipation of what was said to be one of the strongest hurricanes to have formed over the Atlantic Ocean.
Cause_General	The Florida Keys are a coral cay archipelago located off the southern coast of Florida
Main_Consequence	Authorities said 27 people have been killed by Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The death toll is expected to rise as the path of the hurricane is projected to cross ill-prepared population centers in west Florida.
Main_Consequence	Flight charts showed that the hurricane has made the entire state of Florida and the lower half of Georgia no-fly zones.
Main_Consequence	As the eye of the hurricane crept past the Florida Keys and onto the continent, rainfall and wind speed steadily strengthened in Miami,battering towering palm trees and lowly bushes alike, bending them to their limit or breaking them altogether.
Main_Consequence	Trees with trunks as thick as half a meter in diameter were ripped out of earth, smashing the windows of nearby cars.
Main_Consequence	Palm tree branches littered the deserted streets, entirely blocking two lane streets.
Main_Consequence	Much of downtown Miami has been flooded due to the storm surge, and two construction cranes have also been broken.
Main_Consequence	TV signals have been completely cut off since early morning and power went out shortly after.
Cause_General	Local media reported that more than 2 million people are out of power in the state of Florida, including three quarters of the Miami-Dade County located in southeast of Florida.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Utility officials said it will take weeks to restore electricity to everyone.
Cause_General	Local police have imposed a curfew starting 7 p.m. (2300 GMT) Saturday until 7 a.m. (1100 GMT) Sunday, and said police and the fire department will not respond to calls after the wind speed reaches 39 mph, or 63 kph.
Cause_General	Nearly 7 million people in southeast United States were warned to evacuate, including 6.4 million in Florida alone, reports said.
Distant_Evaluation	But the devastating weather has brought people closer.
Distant_Anecdotal	Hunkering down in a hotel lobby, the Baer family was enjoying a game of cards, after a widespread power outage ruled out other forms of entertainment.

Distant_Anecdotal	"""It's better to stay here with other people in a hotel lobby than alone at home."
Distant_Anecdotal	"We have a German family, a Peruvian family and a mother and a daughter from Barcelona here,"" Baer counted his new acquaintances."
Distant_Anecdotal	Having gone through Hurricanes Andrew and Wilma, Doug was prepared for Hurricane Irma.
Distant_Anecdotal	He stocked up on food, water and gas on Tuesday, and booked the hotel rooms for his family in advance to take advantage of the electric generator there.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""We were relieved to learn that the hurricane has diverted from Miami."
Distant_Anecdotal	"We are hoping to leave the hotel by Tuesday or Wednesday, if the road to our neighborhood can be cleared,"" he said."
Cause_General	The hurricane, which arrived in Florida as a Category 4 storm, the second highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale, weakened to a Category 2 with a maximum sustained wind speed of 177 kph by afternoon as it marched up the state's west coast.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	After leaving Florida, a weakened Irma is expected to push into Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee and beyond.
Cause_General	A tropical storm warning was issued for the first time in Atlanta, more than 300 km from the sea coast.

Main	SYDNEY (Reuters) - A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck off the northeast coast of an island of the Pacific Ocean nation of Papua New Guinea on Saturday, officials said, but the tremor posed no tsunami threat to the region.
Cause_General	There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties from the quake, which was centered in a much more remote region than a magnitude 7.5 tremor that rocked the country’s mountainous mainland highlands on Feb. 26, killing 100 people.
Cause_General	The epicenter of Saturday’s quake was located 180 kilometers (112 miles) southwest of Rabaul on New Britain island, some 900 km northeast of the capital Port Moresby, at a depth of 68 km (40 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said.
Cause_General	The quake was revised down from an initial reading of magnitude 6.8 and a depth of 60 km.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Based on all available data a destructive Pacific-wide tsunami is not expected,” the Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said in a bulletin.
Distant_Evaluation	Quakes are common in Papua New Guinea, which sits on the Pacific’s “Ring of Fire”, a hotspot for seismic activity due to friction between tectonic plates.
Cause_General	Rabaul lies in the shadow of Mount Tavurvur, an active volcano that destroyed the town in 1994 during a severe eruption.
Cause_General	The latest quake comes as Papua New Guinea struggles to get aid to desperate survivors of the Feb. 26 quake, which flattened whole villages and spoiled water supplies on the country’s main island.
Distant_Evaluation	A month on, disaster and relief officials say the scale of the emergency is testing the finances and capacity of one of the world’s poorest countries.
Cause_General	The impoverished country is also missing its largest revenue earner, after the quake forced a shutdown of Exxon Mobil Corp’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, which has annual sales of $3 billion at current LNG prices.
Cause_General	The firm is still assessing quake damage at its facilities.

Main	MEXICO CITY, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Rosa has reduced to a tropical depression west of Mexico's Baja California peninsula but is still generating dangerous weather, said the National Meteorological Service (SMN) on Tuesday.
Cause_General	The national weather forecaster published a report at 4 a.m. local time (0900 GMT) and stated that Rosa was 55 km northwest of Ensenada, a port city on the Pacific coast of Baja California peninsula.
Cause_General	Rosa is presenting wind speeds of 55 km per hour, gusts of 75 km per hour and moving northeast at around 17 km per hour.
Cause_General	The SMN reported intense storms in Ensenada and Mexicali, the capital city of the state of Baja California.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At least seven regions in the state of Sonora, on the east of Baja California, will also be hit by storms.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At Baja California Sur, the southern end of the Baja California peninsula, storms will be stronger.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The report predicted waves of two to five meters high on the west of the Baja California peninsula in the Pacific, and on the west of the Sonoran coast in the Gulf of California.
Cause_General	Authorities have already declared an emergency in at least six regions of Baja California, involving some 40,000 inhabitants.
Cause_General	Schools were suspended across Mexicali, south Ensenada and the San Felipe Valley on Tuesday.
Cause_General	According to El Universal, a Mexican daily, one man was killed in Sonora after being swept away by the swollen Las Granjas river.
Cause_Specific	Rosa formed on Sept. 25 around 660 km southwest of Manzanillo, a Pacific Ocean port city in the western state of Colima, and reached a Category 4 hurricane level before abating.
Main	(Reuters) - Tropical storm Florence continued to wreck havoc with the FEI World Equestrian Games (WEG) in Tryon, North Carolina on Sunday wiping all of the day’s scheduled events.
Main	Show jumping, the final discipline of the eventing competition, was moved to Monday while the dressage freestyle was canceled on Saturday and will not be rescheduled.
Cause_General	The dressage freestyle, an Olympic event, becomes the second competition to be canceled and no medals awarded after the endurance competition was canceled on Wednesday due to dangerous heat and humidity.
Distant_Evaluation	“This was not an easy decision,” said Tryon 2018 organizing committee president Michael Stone said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“But we have explored every option, including trying to reschedule the horse departures, and even looking at moving the competition into the indoor with a change of footing, but the logistics of making all this happen are just not possible.
Distant_Evaluation	“The weather has simply left us with no choice.
Distant_Evaluation	“Horse welfare has to be the top priority and flying the horses out on the same day as competition doesn’t work, so sadly the decision to cancel the Freestyle had to be taken.”
Cause_Specific	Florence, which crashed into the state as a hurricane on Friday, bringing record rainfall continues to drench the Tryon International Equestrian Center with the National Weather Service issuing a flash flood warning through Monday for the Tryon area.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Conditions, however, are expected to improve dramatically from Tuesday allowing the WEG, which concludes on Sunday with the individual show jumping, to complete the remaining events without further disruption.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Our staff and volunteers are working around the clock to ensure families in high-risk areas of the country are being evacuated to higher ground,"" he added."
Cause_General	The heavy downpours have paralyzed transport in several parts of the country with vehicles even being submerged with motorists have either been stranded for several hours or had to cut short their journey as routes are rendered impassable.
Distant_Evaluation	Some roads have been cut off making the transport situation in the country a nightmare.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This even as the weatherman indicates that the current weather pattern may persist.
Cause_General	The Red Cross said it is conducting search and rescue efforts, evacuating families in high-risk areas, providing basic health services and emergency shelter while delivering essential supplies like household items and water and sanitation in evacuation centers.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The city's five boroughs are under a flash flood watch until 7 p.m. Tuesday as the system is expected to dump up to two inches of rain on the metropolitan area, according to the National Weather Service.
Cause_Specific	The rain started just after 1 p.m. and quickly made a mess of the Bryant Park, Penn Station, 34th Street, and 8th Avenue stations.
Cause_General	Streams of water were seen dripping at the bustling Times Square subway hub and commuters had to wade through a massive puddle in the First Avenue L train station, according to videos posted to social media.
Distant_Evaluation	"""When it rains it pours in the @NYCTSubway system,"" tweeted a user called jeremy rosenberg, posting a video of water pouring into the Bryant Park station."

Cause_General	PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Children in the Indonesian city of Palu began returning to school on Monday to tidy up their classrooms and hopefully see their friends 10 days after a major earthquake and tsunami struck.
Main	The 7.5 magnitude quake on Sept. 28 brought down many buildings in the small city on Sulawesi island, 1,500 km (30 miles) northeast of Jakarta, while tsunami waves smashed into its beachfront.
Distant_Evaluation	But the biggest killer was probably soil liquefaction, which happens when a powerful quake turns the ground into a liquid mire and which obliterated several Palu neighborhoods.
Main_Consequence	The official death toll rose to 1,948 and bodies are still being recovered.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	No one knows how many people are missing, especially in the areas hit by liquefaction, but it could be as high as 5,000, the national disaster agency said.
Cause_General	At one state high school, teenagers dressed in gray and white uniforms swept up broken glass in the classrooms.
Cause_General	Trophies had fallen from a broken school showcase and the basketball court was cracked.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It’s sad to see our school like this,” said Dewi Rahmawati, 17, who expects to graduate next year and wants to study economics at university.
Cause_General	The students found out that they had to turn up to school through messages on Facebook and WhatsApp.

Distant_Anecdotal	“We won’t force the students to come back because many are traumatized.
Distant_Anecdotal	But we must start again soon to keep their spirits up and so they don’t fall behind,” he said.
Distant_Anecdotal	The school had lost at least seven students and one teacher, he said.

Main	NEW YORK (Reuters) - False tsunami warnings flashed on cellphones along the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts on Tuesday morning when a U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) systems test went awry, unnerving Americans from Maine to Texas.
Cause_General	The false alerts appeared to have been sent by the private forecasting company AccuWeather, according to cellphone images posted on social media.
Distant_Evaluation	AccuWeather pointed the finger at the NWS.
Distant_Evaluation	“Yikes!” Trish Milburn, a writer of romance novels who lives on Florida’s Gulf Coast, wrote on Twitter.
Distant_Evaluation	“That warning is not what you want to see when you live less than 10 feet (3 meters) above sea level.”
Distant_Evaluation	It was not the first time this year Americans were roused by their cellphones warning of an impending catastrophe.
Cause_General	Last month’s false alarm was a missile headed for Hawaii.
Distant_Evaluation	The National Weather Service said its National Tsunami Warning Center issued a routine monthly test message that was misconstrued, spooking people in cities as far apart as Boston and Houston.
Distant_Evaluation	“The test message was released by at least one private sector company as an official Tsunami Warning, resulting in widespread reports of tsunami warnings received via phones and other media across the East Coast, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean,” the service said in a statement.
Cause_General	At least some people who clicked the alert to read the full message saw a disclaimer that the alert was in fact a test, according to screenshots posted online.
Distant_Evaluation	AccuWeather said the National Weather Service wrongly coded the test as a real warning, confusing its automated alerts system.
Distant_Evaluation	“AccuWeather has the most sophisticated system for passing on NWS tsunami warnings based on a complete computer scan of the codes used by the NWS,” the company said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“While the words ‘TEST’ were in the header, the actual codes read by computers used coding for real warning, indicating it was a real warning.”
Distant_Historical	AccuWeather said it had warned the National Weather Service in 2014 of this vulnerability after a similar error.
Distant_Evaluation	The National Weather Service said its investigation confirmed the message was coded as a test.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are working with private sector companies to determine why some systems did not recognize the coding.
Distant_Evaluation	Private sector partners perform a valuable service in disseminating warnings to the public.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	We will continue to work with our partners to prevent this from occurring again,” NWS said in a statement.
Cause_General	An AccuWeather spokesman could not be reached late Tuesday to respond.
Distant_Evaluation	It was not clear how many people saw the false alerts.
Cause_General	Residents of the West Coast were warned in January to brace for a possible tsunami after an earthquake off the coast of Alaska.
Cause_General	The warnings were later lifted and no significant damage was reported.
Main	PALU, Indonesia (Reuters) - Rescue workers in Indonesia stepped up their search for victims of an earthquake and tsunami on Tuesday, hoping to find as many bodies as they can before this week’s deadline for their work to halt, as the official death toll rose to 2,010.
Cause_Specific	The national disaster mitigation agency has called off the search from Thursday, citing concern about the spread of disease.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Debris would be cleared and areas where bodies lie would eventually be turned into parks, sports venues and memorials.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Perhaps as many as 5,000 victims of the 7.5 magnitude quake and tsunami on September 28 have yet to be found, most of them entombed in flows of mud flows that surged from the ground when the quake agitated the soil into a liquid mire.
Cause_General	Most of the bodies have been found in the seaside city of Palu, on the west coast of Sulawesi island, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of the capital, Jakarta.
Cause_General	More than 10,000 rescue workers are scouring expanses of debris, especially in three areas obliterated by soil liquefaction in the south of the small city.
Distant_Anecdotal	“We’re not sure what will happen afterwards, so we’re trying to work as fast as possible,” said rescue worker Ahmad Amin, 29, referring to the deadline, as he took a break in the badly hit Balaroa neighbourhood.
Cause_General	At least nine excavators were working through the rubble of Balaroa on Tuesday, picking their way through smashed buildings and pummelled vehicles.
Distant_Evaluation	At least a dozen bodies were recovered, a Reuters photographer said.
Error	Related Coverage Health fears turn from injury to disease as Indonesia quake toll rises above 2,000

Distant_Anecdotal	“It doesn’t matter if it’s my family or not, the important thing is that we find as many as we can.”
Main	The state disaster mitigation agency said the search was being stepped up and focused more intensely on areas where many people are believed to be buried.
Distant_Anecdotal	The decision to end the search has angered some relatives of the missing but taxi driver Rudy Rahman, 40, said he had to accept it.
Distant_Anecdotal	“As long as they keep searching, I will be here every day looking for my son,” said Rahman, who said he had lost three sons in the disaster.

Cause_General	Indonesia has traditionally been reluctant to be seen as relying on outside help to cope with disasters, and the government shunned foreign aid this year when earthquakes struck the island of Lombok.
Cause_General	But it has accepted help from abroad to cope with the Sulawesi disaster.
Cause_General	The disaster agency, in a notice posted on Twitter, set the rules out for foreign non-governmental organisations (NGOs), saying they were not allowed to “go directly to the field” and could only work with “local partners”.
Cause_General	“Foreign citizens who are working with foreign NGOs are not allowed to conduct any activity on the sites,” it said, adding that foreign NGOs with people deployed should withdraw them immediately.
Cause_General	A few foreign aid workers have been in the disaster zone, including a team from the group Pompiers Humanitaires Francais that searched for survivors, but they have spoken of difficulties in getting entry permits and authorisation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“This is the first time we encountered such difficulty in actually getting to do our work,” team leader Arnaud Allibert told Reuters, adding they were leaving on Wednesday as their help was no longer needed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Indonesian governments are wary of being too open to outside help because they could face criticism from political opponents and there is particular resistance to the presence of foreign military personnel, as it could be seen as an infringement of sovereignty.
Distant_Evaluation	“There are political sensitivities, especially with an election coming up, and sovereignty is another issue,” said Keith Loveard, a senior analyst with advisory and risk firm Concord Consulting, referring to polls due next year.

Main	LAGOS, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's west state of Niger on Wednesday said 1,300 people have been displaced by floods in eight communities in the east part of the state.
Cause_Specific	The communities located around Zungeru Hydro Power Station were submerged following the release of water from Shiroro dam, Ibrahim Inga, director general of the state Emergency Management Agency (NSEMA), told reporters in Minna, the state capital.
Cause_General	Inga said farmlands and houses were also affected, adding that the displaced persons have been evacuated to a local primary school.
Cause_General	He said the agency was taking inventory of the affected persons to ensure that they were free from diseases.

Main	MOGADISHU, May 27 (Xinhua) -- At least 21 people have been killed and thousand others affected by floods and storm due to heavy rains pounding parts of the Horn of Africa nation, the UN relief agency has said.
Main_Consequence	The UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said floods and storm which have affected nearly 800,000 people and displaced over 230,000 others have also affected livelihoods, livestock, shelter and key infrastructure across the country.
Main_Consequence	"""So far, 21 people are confirmed dead including nine in Hirshabelle State, four in Jubaland State and eight in Banadir region,"" OCHA said in its Flash Update."
Cause_General	The Somali government and humanitarian partners are seeking 80 million U.S. dollars to mitigate the impact of the floods and avert a larger scale humanitarian crisis.
Cause_General	The relief agencies are also seeking to capitalize on the agricultural potential the rains present in order to address the food insecurity that has been exacerbated by protracted drought.
Cause_General	The flooding comes against the backdrop of ongoing efforts to address the effects of previous consecutive drought seasons which left at least 5.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.
Cause_Specific	According to the UN, the first half of Somalia's Gu rainy season, which started in March, has recorded an unprecedented amount of rainfall, comparable only to heavy rains last witnessed in Somalia in 1981.
Cause_General	The past week has seen a reduction in rainfall activity across Somalia and in the Ethiopian highlands, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-managed Somalia Water and Land Information Management (SWALIM).

Main	KOCHI/BENGALURU, India (Reuters) - The worst floods in a century in the Indian state of Kerala have killed 164 people and forced more than 200,000 into relief camps, officials said on Friday, with the toll expected to rise as heavy rain pushes water levels higher still.
Cause_General	As the southwestern coastal state’s chief minister sought military reinforcements to boost rescue efforts, a disaster management official said that, since the monsoon season started about three months ago, more than 320 people had died due to flooding and landslides.
Distant_Evaluation	As the waters have risen, many people have found it increasingly hard to access food and other basic amenities, or to reach safety.
Distant_Evaluation	“In some areas, airlifting is the only option... thousands are still marooned,” Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Vijayan said he was hoping the military could step up its support for rescuers already using dozens of helicopters and hundreds of boats.
Distant_Evaluation	“I spoke to the defense minister this morning and asked for more helicopters,” he told a news conference in the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram, adding that he planned to send 11 more helicopters to the worst-hit areas.
Cause_General	During the current monsoon, Kerala has been hit with over a third more rain than average, according to India’s weather office.
Cause_Specific	Vijayan said the floods were the worst in a century.
Main	In the latest bout that began nine days ago, 164 people have died and some 223,000 moved into more than 1,500 relief camps, Vijayan said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Further heavy rainfall has been forecast for most parts of the state on Saturday, and authorities said they planned to implement controlled releases of water from dams to manage flows and minimize damage.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Rains are expected to subside to “light to moderate” levels on Sunday, India’s weather office said.

Cause_General	A Reuters witness in a relief helicopter in Chengannur, a town in southern Kerala, saw people stranded on roof tops and waving desperately for help.
Distant_Evaluation	“The town looked like an island dotted with houses and cars submerged in muddy flood waters and downed coconut trees,” he said.
Cause_General	Two circling navy helicopters dropped food and water in metal baskets and airlifted out at least four people, including a three-year-old child.
Distant_Evaluation	Anil Vasudevan, the head of the Kerala health disaster response wing, said his department had geared up to meet victims’ needs.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’ve deployed adequate doctors and staff and provided all essential medicines in the relief camps,” he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	His teams were also making arrangements to minimize the risk of people contracting water-borne diseases once they return home after the floodwaters subside.
Cause_General	The rains have also disrupted transport networks in Kerala, a major destination for domestic and foreign tourists.

Main_Consequence	(Reuters) - Florida’s governor mobilized National Guard troops and thousands of Gulf Coast residents were ordered evacuated on Monday, two days before Hurricane Michael was forecast to slam ashore with life-threatening waves, winds and rains.
Main	Michael was packing sustained winds of up to 85 miles per hour (140 kph) and gaining strength as it skirted past Cuba’s western tip en route to a likely Wednesday landfall as the most powerful storm to strike the Florida Panhandle in at least a decade.
Cause_General	Currently ranked as a Category 1 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson wind scale, Michael could grow into a Category 3, becoming the second major hurricane in the Atlantic basin this year following Florence last month, forecasters said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The storm is expected to unleash coastal storm surges of up to 12 feet (3.7 meters) along Florida’s Panhandle and dump as much as a foot (30 cm) of rain across Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The NHC warned that both could trigger deadly flooding, and that residents within the hurricane warning zone should likewise “prepare for life-threatening winds.”
Main_Consequence	Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in 35 counties along Florida’s Panhandle and Big Bend regions.
Main_Consequence	Mandatory evacuations were under way in coastal areas, with 1,250 National Guard soldiers aiding the process and more than 4,000 troops placed on standby, Scott tweeted.
Distant_Evaluation	“The FL panhandle needs to be prepared for a direct hit with sustained hurricane force winds,” Scott wrote on Twitter on Monday.
Main_Consequence	In Gulf County alone, the first to begin ordering residents of low-lying areas to higher ground, mandatory evacuation notices encompassed an estimated 3,800 homes, said Jessica Sasich of the county’s emergency operations center.
Cause_General	Many are located in the coastal town of Port St. Joe, the county’s largest municipality, lying directly in the hurricane’s projected path, she said.
Main_Consequence	In neighboring Alabama, Governor Kay Ivey declared an emergency for the entire state on Monday in anticipation of wind damage, heavy rains and power outages.

Cause_Specific	MICHAEL KILLS 13 IN CENTRAL AMERICA
Cause_Specific	As the storm moved north it battered Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula and western Cuba with drenching rains and winds of up to 80 mph (130 kph), the Miami-based hurricane center said.
Cause_Specific	Torrential downpours and flash-flooding over the weekend caused 13 deaths in Central America after Michael formed off the coast of northern Honduras.
Main_Consequence	In Florida, state offices, schools and universities were set to close on Tuesday through the end of the week in panhandle counties.
Cause_General	Some beach town residents were left to decide on their own for the time being whether to leave their homes.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I haven’t made up my mind yet, but I know some of my staff are going,” said Dave Trepanier, owner of Firefly, a restaurant a block from the beach in Panama City, Bay County, an area where the hurricane is expected to come ashore.
Distant_Anecdotal	Lines at gasoline stations were growing long in Panama City as people prepared to leave areas under mandatory evacuation, Trepanier said.

Main	With memories of his administration's flat-footed response to Hurricane Katrina still lingering, President Bush visited a tornado-wrecked patch of Kansas on Wednesday to pledge administration vigilance in recovery efforts.
Distant_Evaluation	The visit seemed to have a dual purpose: to deliver an in-person pledge of support for the town of Greensburg, and to dispel any comparisons to the hurricane response, one day after his administration sparred with Gov.
Distant_Evaluation	Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas over disaster readiness.
Cause_General	The governor was at his side as he toured the wreckage.
Distant_Evaluation	''Our role as government officials is to work with the states and local folks to get whatever help is appropriate here,'' Mr. Bush said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Speaking to reporters separately, Ms. Sebelius, a Democrat, said, ''There will be money -- federal, state, local,'' adding, ''We have an opportunity to rebuild a real American town.''
Distant_Evaluation	Behind the scenes, tension remained.
Cause_General	On the way to Kansas aboard Air Force One, the director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, R. David Paulison, was sent to the press cabin to refute the notion that the response in Kansas was anything less than swift and thorough.
Distant_Evaluation	''I've asked probably at least 20 times, Is there anything that you need you don't have?''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Paulison said.
Distant_Evaluation	''The answer is no.
Distant_Evaluation	The response in this particular case was absolutely phenomenal.''
Distant_Evaluation	And officials pointed to positive reviews across the state, including one from Earl Liggett, Kiowa County commissioner, who, referring to the hurricane response, said in an interview: ''I think FEMA was left with some egg on its face there, and they're going to make sure it doesn't happen here, and it hasn't.
Distant_Evaluation	It's been an unbelievable response.''
Distant_Evaluation	But FEMA's response was never at issue in the dispute with Kansas officials.
Distant_Evaluation	Ms. Sebelius had criticized the shortages of equipment for the local National Guard, which she linked to its heavy deployment in Iraq.
Cause_General	She did not repeat that criticism on Wednesday.
Distant_Evaluation	She said the response had been ''prompt and good,'' and she added, ''We have a lot of assets here now.''
Distant_Anecdotal	A bit later, one of Ms. Sebelius's aides said the governor's concern was not about the initial response, but the rebuilding ahead.
Distant_Anecdotal	''It's the ongoing recovery effort that may be hampered,'' the aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he did not want to upstage the governor.
Distant_Anecdotal	''After Air Force One leaves, we've still got work to do.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, said that if state officials determined they were ill-equipped, ''they'll get what they need, period.''
Distant_Evaluation	For his part, Mr. Bush stuck to tending to those struggling to recover, according to a pool report, surveying the damage first from above, aboard Marine One, his helicopter, and then on the ground.
Distant_Evaluation	Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, a Republican presidential contender, rode the helicopter with Mr. Bush, and when asked about Mr. Bush's reaction, said, ''Pretty devastating.''
Distant_Evaluation	Later, standing amid the wreckage on Bay Street, Mr. Bush said: ''My mission is to -- today, though, is to lift people's spirits as best as I possibly can and to hopefully touch somebody's soul by representing our country, and to let people know that while there was a dark day in the past, there's brighter days ahead.''

Main	MEXICO CITY, Sept. 27 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane Rosa has developed to Category 2 and could continue to strengthen as it made its way across the Pacific along Mexico's northwest coastline, the country's National Weather Service (SMN) said Thursday.
Cause_General	According to SMN, at 10 a.m. local time Thursday, Rosa sustained winds of 165 kilometers per hour and gusts of 205 kilometers per hour.
Cause_General	The hurricane's strong clouds caused storms in northwestern Mexican states.
Cause_General	On Thursday morning, the hurricane was located some 855 kilometers southwest of the resort of Cabo San Lucas in the state of Baja California Sur, moving off the coast at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The SMN predicted Rosa would strengthen to a Category 3 by Thursday night, when it is expected to be situated some 955 kilometers southwest of the same location in the Baja California peninsula.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The storm's projected trajectory showed it would be moving away from the Mexican coast on Friday, but on Saturday would change course and move toward the peninsula, the SMN said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If its projected path holds true, Rosa will be very close to the Baja California coast on Oct. 2 but as a weakened tropical storm with winds of 75 kilometers per hour and gusts of 95 kilometers per hour.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The SMN is asking citizens in the states of Baja California Sur, Sinaloa, Nayarit, Jalisco and Colima to take precautions as continued rainfall could lead to mudslides, landslides and overflowing rivers or flooding.
Cause_Specific	Rosa formed as a tropical storm last Tuesday along the western coast of the country and currently authorities in Baja California are staying on pre-alert for the possibility of the storm making landfall during the first few days of October.
Cause_General	Mexico's northwest and west have been hit by heavy rain since last week which led to flooding in local areas and have left at least 13 dead, five of them in Sinaloa and eight in Michoacan, according to official reports.

Main	CHICAGO, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- Political bias and partisan news reporting influence whether people indicate experiencing certain extreme weather events, a new U.S. study showed.
Cause_Specific	The researchers surveyed 3,057 people in the U.S. to ask them about the extreme weather they had experienced over a five-year period.
Cause_Specific	Participants were asked where they live and if they believe in climate change, human causation and the scientific consensus on the matter.
Cause_Specific	The experts then compared these answers to official weather reports for that region for the same time period.
Cause_Specific	Data about the weather was taken from the Storm Events Database compiled by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Weather Service.
Cause_Specific	The data included droughts, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes.
Cause_Specific	Nearly 22 percent of respondents reported experiencing a polar vortex; 41 percent a drought; 20 percent a tornado; 29 percent a flood and 17 percent a hurricane in the past five years.
Cause_Specific	However the data shows that 21 percent lived in a county where a flood was recorded over the time period; 25 percent a tornado; 4 percent a hurricane and 4 percent drought.
Cause_Specific	"About 59 percent of respondents agreed that ""there is solid evidence that the average temperature on Earth has been getting warmer over the past few decades."""
Cause_Specific	"Of respondents who agreed with this statement, 74 percent agreed that Earth was warming mostly due to ""human activity such as burning fossil fuels."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""This research shows people's perception of extreme weather can be processed through partisan lenses,"" said Ben Lyons, a researcher at the University of Exeter and the study's lead author."
Main	The study found that Republicans are less likely to report experiencing a polar vortex, while those exposed to liberal media are more likely.
Distant_Evaluation	Nevertheless, the weather sometimes can be so extreme that it overshadows personal views, the researchers say.
Cause_Specific	They found that partisanship and media use did not affect the way people in the U.S. Northeast, where the 2014 and 2015 polar vortex events hit hardest, reported the weather they had experienced.
Cause_Specific	Those who favored liberal news sources reported experiencing drought more often than national weather data would suggest they actually did.
Cause_General	The study has been published in the journal Environmental Communication.
Main	ATHENS (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake shook western Greece early on Friday, damaging a port and a 15th century monastery, but causing no major injuries, officials and local media said.
Main_Consequence	The quake sent out tremors felt as far afield as Libya, Italy, Malta and Albania.
Cause_General	Greek authorities initially issued a tsunami warning then withdrew the alert.
Cause_General	The magnitude 6.4 quake struck in the Ionian Sea, 50 km (31 miles) south of the island of Zakynthos, also known as Zante, Greece’s Geodynamic Institute reported.
Cause_General	The U.S. Geological Survey rated the magnitude at 6.8.
Main_Consequence	Three people were taken to hospital on the island, two of them slightly injured, a spokesman for Greece’s civil protection agency said.
Main_Consequence	A series of aftershocks, the highest at 5.6, rattled the island and power was briefly disrupted.
Main_Consequence	Tremors damaged a 15th-century monastery on the nearby islands of Strofades, local media in Zakynthos reported.
Main_Consequence	They also left large cracks in the port of Zakynthos, though authorities there said operations would continue as usual.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are not facing any particular problems,” Zakynthos Mayor Pavlos Kolokotsas told Greek state broadcaster ERT.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Calm is being restored.”
Distant_Evaluation	Extensive damage was avoided because quake-prone Zakynthos had adopted seismic protection codes in construction, said Efthymios Lekkas, head of Greece’s Earthquake Planning and Protection Organisation.
Distant_Evaluation	“The energy unleashed, based on the angle of the faultline, fanned out towards Italy,” he added.
Main_Consequence	Italy’s Il Messaggero online news site said the quake was felt hundreds of kilometers away in southern Italy.
Main_Consequence	Firefighters in Calabria, Puglia and Sicily received thousands of telephone calls from worried locals.
Distant_Historical	Zakynthos was all but destroyed in a 6.8 tremor in 1953.
Distant_Historical	More than 140 people were killed in an earthquake north of Athens in 1999.

Distant_Evaluation	The quake was fairly shallow, according to the USGS, just 14 km (8.7 miles) below the seabed, which would have amplified shaking.
Cause_General	It struck at 1:54 a.m. (2254 GMT, Thursday).
Cause_General	Greece straddles two tectonic plates and often suffers earthquakes.
Main_Consequence	The EMSC European quake agency said sea levels had risen slightly, by about 20 cm (7.87 inches), but the increase could be higher locally.

Main	ABUJA, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people have been confirmed killed and hundreds of others displaced by flood in Adamawa State of Nigeria's northeast region, a local official said on Thursday.
Main	Many hectares of farmlands have also been destroyed by the flood caused by recent heavy rainfalls in the state, Muhammed Suleiman, scribe of the State Emergency Management Agency, told reporters.
Distant_Evaluation	According to Suleiman, many communities across nine local areas located at the bank of River Benue, the second longest river in Nigeria, were affected by the flood.
Cause_General	He said more than half of the state population was currently under threat of impending flood.
Cause_General	Local residents also lost hundreds of domestic animals, including cattle, to the disaster.
Distant_Evaluation	The official said the extent of damage is alarming and that flooding has become a very serious challenge and posed a threat to farming activities in the northeast state.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This causes a more serious threat to food security in the state,"" he added."
Distant_Evaluation	On Wednesday, the National Emergency Management Agency said flooding became alarming in Adamawa and 11 other states since Sept. 7, but the agency was not relenting in its effort to prevent any worse situations.

Cause_General	The official death toll from a 7.5 magnitude earthquake and tsunami on Sept. 28 has risen to 2,045, with more bodies being found as some 10,000 rescuers scour ruins in the seaside city of Palu.
Cause_Specific	More than 82,000 people were displaced in the worst-hit city of Palu, 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of the capital, Jakarta, and 67,000 homes destroyed or damaged.
Cause_General	Many survivors are living in shelters made out of salvaged wood and plastic in the city and surrounding hills, where they wait and wonder what will happen to them.
Distant_Anecdotal	“They keep saying there’s going to be compensation, but where is it?” asked student Ahmad Hidayat.
Distant_Anecdotal	Hidayat is from the city’s Balaroa district, which was devastated by liquefaction, which happens when an earthquake violently shakes soft, damp soil, turning solid ground into a viscous, roiling liquid.
Distant_Anecdotal	“What are the plans?
Distant_Anecdotal	Are we going to be relocated, will there be help to move people back?
Distant_Anecdotal	There’s no certainty,” said Hidayat, standing in a heavily damaged garage where he works part-time with other young men, trying to salvage auto parts from the debris.
Distant_Anecdotal	Another Balaroa resident, Hesti Andayani, 27, was sitting and crying on tiles that she said used to be part of her bedroom.
Distant_Anecdotal	It was her first trip home since the earthquake struck, killing her younger sister.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I don’t know what we’ll do.
Distant_Anecdotal	We don’t have any money.
Distant_Anecdotal	I’ll have to find a job but I don’t know where we can live,” she said.
Cause_General	Rescue teams were working with residents to try to identify where victims could be.
Distant_Evaluation	But it’s guesswork because of how far the ground moved during liquefaction.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	No one knows how many people have yet to be found in Balaroa and other neighborhoods but it could be as many as 5,000, the disaster agency says.
Cause_General	BODY BAGS
Cause_General	Twenty-six bodies were found on Tuesday but the number seemed to fall off on Wednesday.
Distant_Evaluation	Reuters reporters saw only two victims being carried out in plastic body bags.
Cause_General	The government has called off the search for bodies from Thursday, citing concern about the spread of disease.
Distant_Evaluation	That has angered many relatives of the missing but it will focus the efforts of authorities on the next phase - rebuilding.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Reconstruction and rehabilitation are scheduled to start in early November,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the national disaster mitigation agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He said data was being compiled and mapping done to help determine where houses should be built.
Distant_Evaluation	The danger of tsunamis near the coast in the north of the city and of soil liquefaction in the south are the major worries.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Areas hit by liquefaction will be turned into parks and sports fields and memorials.
Cause_General	Nugroho declined to speculate on how long it would take to build new houses.
Cause_General	The chief executive of the World Bank, Kristalina Georgieva, offered Indonesia various help on Wednesday including financing for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of housing and neighborhood-level infrastructure and services.

Main	TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan has acknowledged for the first time that a worker at the Fukushima nuclear power plant, destroyed by an earthquake and tsunami more than seven years ago, died from radiation exposure.
Distant_Historical	A 9.0 magnitude earthquake struck in March 2011, triggering a tsunami that killed some 18,000 people and the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl 25 years earlier.
Main_Consequence	The Health, Labour and Welfare Ministry ruled on Friday that compensation should be paid to the family of the man in his 50s who died from lung cancer, an official told Reuters by phone.
Cause_Specific	The worker had spent his career working at nuclear plants around Japan and worked at the Fukushima Daiichi plant operated by Tokyo Electric Power at least twice after the March 2011 meltdowns at the station.
Distant_Historical	He was diagnosed with cancer in February 2016, the official said.
Cause_General	The ministry had previously ruled exposure to radiation caused the illnesses of four workers at Fukushima, the official said.
Main	This was the first death, he said.
Distant_Historical	More than 160,000 people were forced from their homes after the meltdowns at the plant.
Distant_Evaluation	Hundreds of deaths have been attributed to the chaos of evacuations during the crisis and because of the hardship and mental trauma refugees have experienced since then, but the government had said that radiation was not a cause.
Cause_General	Tokyo Electric is facing a string of legal cases seeking compensation over the disaster.

Main	LAGOS, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's emergency agency has placed all disaster response units across the country on red alert due to rising water levels, an official said Friday.
Cause_Specific	Water levels across the country have been rising consistently due to heavy rainfall, Mustapha Maihaja, director-general of National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He said NEMA has identified 12 frontline states that might be prone to floods this year, noting that floods could occur any time in those states.
Distant_Evaluation	Meanwhile, police in northeast Adamawa has advised riverine communities in the state to relocate before Saturday to avoid impending flood.
Distant_Evaluation	Habibu Musa, a police spokesperson, said the call became necessary as neighboring Cameroon would release excess water from Lagdo Dam.
Distant_Evaluation	He urged the affected communities to cooperate with security personnel and other emergency workers while relocating to safer areas.

Distant_Evaluation	"RIVER BEND, the United States, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- ""I've lived here for 23 years and the water levels in this hurricane were higher than I've ever seen before,"" John Kirkland, mayor of River Bend, North Carolina, told Xinhua after Hurricane Florence made landfall nearby."
Main	Standing in the town hall building in the center of the town, Kirkland said that half of his town is located in a flood plain and has been inundated by the rising water level.
Main_Consequence	On one side of the town hall building lies a children's playground, with only the upper half of slides and swings visible above the water.
Distant_Evaluation	The town, placed among a network of waterways with easy access to the ocean, had attracted many who enjoy boating on the calm waters of Pamlico Sound, the largest lagoon on the U.S. east coast.
Distant_Evaluation	But during hurricane season, this blessing turns into a curse, as the snaking rivers that hug the town with a population of 3,100 suddenly transformed into muddy pipes that flooded the low lying part of the town.
Cause_General	Kirkland said his home is also among the dozens of houses in the flood plain and has yet to return to his home since the hurricane hit.
Main_Consequence	He has resorted to staying at the town's fire department for safety.
Cause_General	Driving through the drier roads of River Bend, fallen tree branches scattered the neatly managed lawns, with one as thick as a car wheel ripped from its roots to smash on top of a house.
Cause_General	Many wooden power poles were also knocked down by the strong wind, leaving bare cables lying on ground, spooking locals.
Distant_Evaluation	Kirkland told Xinhua that the worst times came on Friday morning, and although the wind died down somewhat throughout the day, heavy rain persisted.
Distant_Evaluation	"""About 40 percent of (the residents in) the town left before the hurricane, and among those left some are in need of rescue, which we have started,"" Kirkland said, lamenting that too many people shrugged off hurricane warnings to have put themselves in dangerous positions."
Distant_Evaluation	"""We tried to tell them; it's amazing people don't use common sense,"" he said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With the worst part was over, Kirkland hoped that power can be soon restored to his town, but predicted it may take longer than a week.
Distant_Evaluation	"""In past hurricanes, which were not as bad, it usually took three to four days to get the power back up."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"It may be longer this time,"" he said, indicating that the town hall is the only building in town with power."
Cause_Specific	The predicament of River Bend was not unique along the coast of North Carolina and South Carolina, which were on the direct path of Florence.
Cause_General	During a drive through the coastal region of North Carolina, Xinhua saw roads covered with leaves and branches that were blown off trees, large swaths of farmland submerged under water and gas station roofs that were tipped over.
Cause_General	Florence has caused at least 13 deaths in the Carolinas so far, with over 1 million households and businesses without power, nine airports closed and over 2,500 flights canceled through Sunday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Despite slowing down after making landfall early Friday, U.S. weather forecasters are predicting prolonged rainfall and storm surges in the region, urging local residents to exercise caution.
Main	The almost yearly cycle of flooding along the Passaic River and in the Delaware Valley has prompted a coalition of Republicans and Democrats in the State Assembly to push for a $1.7 billion bond referendum on the November ballot that would allow the state to buy homes that could be in the path of future floods.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The bond issue, which would allocate up to $175 million a year for the next 10 years, would draw on a fraction of the state sales tax.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The money would also help preserve open space, farmlands and historic trusts.
Main	The measure was announced on Wednesday in Fairfield, an Essex County community that flooded last month.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Assemblyman John F. McKeon, a Democrat from Essex County who is one of the primary sponsors of the bill, said the bond issue would add money to the depleted Garden State Preservation Trust Fund.
Cause_General	It has been used in part to buy and demolish 127 homes in floodways since its inception in 1995.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''This will act as reclamation for tideland and river basin properties that should never have been built to begin with,'' Assemblyman McKeon said.
Cause_General	The voluntary program, Blue Acres, administered by the Department of Environmental Protection, sends three state-certified appraisers to each property to determine its value.
Cause_General	The state then makes an offer for the property.
Distant_Evaluation	John Moyle, the chief of the bureau for dam safety and flood control, said that many homes in danger of serious flood damage were built before the creation of regulations that specified the flood plain.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. McKeon said he hoped the Assembly would vote on the bill within a month; it would then go to the Senate.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If it passes there, it will be on the statewide ballot in November.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''If even a fifth of the properties in this flood plain were to sell, the state could reclaim that property and make it much more as a natural barrier to land that was developed, as it should be,'' Mr. McKeon said.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It could also lead to the formation of waterspouts in front of the coast of Puerto Vallarta, the SMN said, referring to another beach resort in the state of Jalisco next to Nayarit.
Distant_Historical	Nearly three years ago to the day, Hurricane Patricia, one of the most powerful storms on record, struck Mexico close to Puerto Vallarta with winds that tore down trees, moved cars and forced thousands of people to flee homes.
Distant_Evaluation	Speaking in the western city of Guadalajara, President Enrique Pena Nieto warned the population to prepare for the arrival of Willa and urged residents to take cover.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The storm was about 100 miles (160 km) west of the town of Cabo Corrientes and is “expected to be a dangerous major hurricane when it reaches the coast of Mexico”, the NHC said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Willa is moving northward and is forecast to gradually lose power during the next day or so and weaken rapidly after hitting the coast, the Miami-based hurricane center added.
Distant_Evaluation	The SMN urged residents to “exercise extreme caution” as rains have softened the soil in some areas.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Willa’s downpours could cause landslides, flooding and damage to roadways.
Cause_General	The NHC said that the Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter Aircraft that was en route to Willa experienced a safety issue before entering the storm and had to return to base.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Willa is expected to douse coastal states Jalisco, Nayarit and Sinaloa with 6 to 12 inches (15 to 30 cm) of rain, likely triggering flash floods and landslides, the NHC said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some areas may see as much as 18 inches (45 cm) of rainfall.
Cause_General	To the south, Tropical Storm Vicente weakened further, with maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph).
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It was churning some 310 miles (500 km) southeast of the Pacific port Manzanillo, and would likely dissipate soon, the NHC said.
Main	BARCELONA (Reuters) - Hurricane Leslie is expected to hit the Iberian Peninsula within hours, authorities said on Saturday, bringing strong winds and heavy rains days after deadly floods on the Spanish island of Mallorca.
Main	The storm will most likely hit land around the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, before moving across the peninsula, bringing winds of up to 100 km/h (60 mph), Spain’s state weather service said.
Cause_General	Earlier this week, 12 people died in the flooding on Mallorca in the Mediterranean.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Currently a Category 1 hurricane, Leslie is expected to weaken slightly as it moves east on Saturday, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre (NHC) said.
Cause_Specific	As of Saturday afternoon, Leslie was about 200 miles (320 km) west of Lisbon, the NHC said, adding that it is expected to become a post-tropical cyclone and dissipate by Sunday night or Monday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Spanish emergency services warned of the possibility of flash floods and urged to motorists to be vigilant in case of strong winds.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Separate storm fronts in the north and east of Spain mean heavy rain is expected across much of the country on Sunday.
Cause_General	Heavy rain hit Mallorca on Tuesday, sending torrents of brown water along narrow streets in the town of Sant Llorenc.
Cause_General	Rivers burst their banks and swamped homes, leaving roadsides strewn with wrecked vehicles and beaches covered in debris.
Main	HAVANA (Reuters) - Flooding in central Cuba caused by torrential rainfall in the wake of the subtropical storm Alberto has killed four people and prompted the evacuation of tens of thousands, Cuban state-run media said late on Tuesday.

Main_Consequence	After rain dumped more than 4 inches (10 cm) of water in 24 hours, flood waters swept away a bridge and damaged roads and other infrastructure, leaving many communities cut off and nearly 60,000 people without electricity, the media reported.
Main_Consequence	Authorities had to close down part of the national highway after a nearby river burst it banks when they opened the floodgates of the Palmarito reservoir because it had exceeded its maximum capacity.
Main_Consequence	Interior Minister Julio Cesar Gandarilla said in a government meeting with provincial authorities headed by new President Miguel Diaz-Canel that four people had died in the flooding.
Main_Consequence	Seventy-seven year old Cuban Quintiliano Simó Ortega died when trying to cross a flooded river by horseback in Trinidad on the south central coast to get to his farm, the Cuban News Agency reported.
Cause_General	This is the second crisis Diaz-Canel has faced since being selected six weeks ago to replace Raul Castro as Cuba’s president.
Cause_General	The floods come 11 days after a plane crashed shortly after takeoff from Havana, killing 112.
Distant_Evaluation	On each occasion, he has appeared publicly at the forefront of the crisis management, striking a contrast that many Cubans have welcomed to Castro who operated behind the scenes.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Diaz-Canel was cited by state media as saying that authorities should focus on re-establishing basic services such as electricity and transportation when the weather started to improve.
Cause_General	Alberto, the first storm of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, which only officially starts on June 1, already weakened into a subtropical depression on Tuesday after making landfall in the south of the United States, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	U.S. forecasters said last week they expected the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season to be near-normal to above-normal in number and intensity of storms.
Distant_Historical	Last year, Hurricane Irma killed at least 10 people during a devastating three-day rampage along the length of Cuba.

Main	"PARIS, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- Over 40 countries in the Pacific Rim will participate in a mock tsunami scenario for September-November period this year to test their ""tsunami decision-making procedures and communication systems and processes,"", UNESCO (UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) said Thursday."
Main	"Called Exercise Pacific Wave 2018 (PacWave18), the 8th Pacific Tsunami drill ""will simulate Pacific countries in a Tsunami Warning situation requiring government decision-making and community action, essentially all aspects of the Disaster Risk Reduction cycle,"" said UNESCO, a sponsor of scientific studies and exercises on warning systems for various types of natural disasters."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Thanks to the PacWave18, concerned countries would have the opportunity to test new tools including tsunami wave forecasts that will allow each country to better assess its own tsunami threat, according to the Paris-based UN body.
Main	As part of the exercise, participating countries would select from seven different Pacific scenarios based on real events from the past and conduct at least a Tabletop Exercise within the period of September to November, it noted.
Main	The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii, NWPTAC in Japan, and the SCSTAC in China would send simulated warnings, which would trigger a country's tsunami response that would be evaluated by experts, it added.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The events of the 2009 Samoa Islands Region, 2010 Chile, 2011 Japan, and the February 2013 Solomon Islands tsunamis have increased our need to be more prepared for such events,"" said Vladimir Ryabinin, Executive Secretary of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission."

Main	MATI, Greece, Sept. 24, (Xinhua) -- Two months after Greece's seaside resort of Mati was engulfed by a devastating wildfire, which had claimed 99 lives, a distinguished Greek climate expert has warned of the risks of more extreme weather and called for actions to deal with them.
Main	As Mati's local authorities are still trying to heal the wounds of fire, Christos Zerefos, Supervisor of the Research Center for Atmospheric Physics and Climatology of the Academy of Athens and member of various International Scientific Committees, warned in a recent interview with Xinhua that the climate change will make us more often face extreme weather events, either strong winds or heavy rainfall.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And he urged for actions by the end of this century to get Greece better ready for natural disasters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""If we do not take action at national and international level by the end of the 21st century, the cost of natural disasters in our country will amount to 700 billion euros (823.8 billion U.S. dollars)."
Distant_Evaluation	"It is twice the debt of Greece,"" warned Zerefos."
Distant_Evaluation	As one of the experts Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras turned to in the aftermath of the tragedy, Zerefos described the scenes in Mati, only 29 km east of Capital Athens, as a battlefield after bombardment.
Cause_General	The signs of disaster are still visible, as hundreds of gutted houses are left in ruins and people are still accommodated at camps, according to Zerefos.
Cause_Specific	The Greek prime minister has requested their scientific knowledge and experience for dealing with natural disasters and avoiding such tragedies in the future.
Distant_Evaluation	One of the main causes of the fire, according to Zerefos, is that the firefighting forces did not manage to control it in the first five minutes, as strong winds were blowing in the area.
Cause_Specific	Another bad estimate was that the wind would change direction and that Marathon Avenue, where Marathon race was born 2,500 years ago, would serve as a natural obstacle to the blazes, something that did not happen.
Cause_General	"""In the disaster, except from the pine trees, more than 200 cars were also burned in the area."
Distant_Evaluation	The burning of cars equals to about one and a half gasoline tank, explosions occurred and temperatures rose too much, having reached 1,300 degrees Celsius.
Distant_Evaluation	"So it was like a war, as if the area had been bombarded,"" Zerefos explained."
Distant_Evaluation	For Zerefos, preventing such kind of disaster from happening again is also very important.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""If we strengthen the prevention and protection mechanisms, a process that has already begun, this cost will be reduced to around 400 billion euros (470.7 billion U.S. dollars)."
Distant_Evaluation	"It is important therefore to adapt as it is important to try to learn to live with the extreme phenomena,"" the Greek scientist concluded."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some flood control projects have already entered into force in the afflicted areas of Attica and will cost 17 million euros (20 million U.S. dollars), according to a recent Greek Economy and Development ministry pres statement.
Cause_General	The aim is to shield the affected areas against natural disasters, and to protect and regenerate the ecosystems.
Cause_General	Last week the number of the victims from the deadly fire in Mati rose to 99, as one woman was succumbed to her injuries.
Cause_General	The 26-year-old lost her battle to life after a long stay in the Intensive Care Unit.
Cause_General	There are still 17 injured in hospitals.

Main	WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Florence dumped “epic” amounts of rain on North and South Carolina as it trudged inland on Saturday, knocking out power and causing at least eight deaths as flood waters that have devastated many communities kept rising.
Cause_General	Florence’s intensity has diminished since it roared ashore along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast on Friday as a hurricane.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But its slow march over the two states, crawling west at only 3 miles per hour (6 km per hour), is expected to leave large parts of the region deluged in the coming days, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said late Saturday.
Cause_General	“This system is unloading epic amounts of rainfall, in some places measured in feet and not inches,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news briefing.
Cause_General	His state has already endured record rainfall, with much more forecast to come.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Rivers will continue to rise days after the rain has stopped, he said.
Cause_General	“This is a hurricane event followed by a flood event,” said South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster.
Main_Consequence	With flood waters advancing rapidly in many communities, around 50 stranded people had been airlifted out by helicopter in North Carolina, said Petty Officer Michael Himes of the U.S. Coast Guard.
Main_Consequence	More than 26,000 hunkered down in shelters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Numerous roads were closed, and authorities warned of the risk of landslides, tornadoes and flash floods, with dams and bridges in peril as rivers and creeks swelled.
Main_Consequence	As of Saturday, about 676,000 homes and businesses were without power in North Carolina, along with 119,000 in South Carolina.
Main_Consequence	North Carolina officials said there had been at least seven storm-related fatalities in the state, with unconfirmed reports of a further three deaths.
Main_Consequence	South Carolina authorities reported one death.
Main_Consequence	The White House said President Donald Trump approved making federal funding available in some affected counties.

Main_Consequence	In Fayetteville, a North Carolina city of about 210,000 people about 90 miles inland, authorities told thousands of residents near the Cape Fear River and Little River to get out of their homes by Sunday afternoon because of the flood risk.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If you are refusing to leave during this mandatory evacuation, you need to do things like notify your legal next of kin because the loss of life is very, very possible,” Mayor Mitch Colvin said at a news conference.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The worst is yet to come,” he added.
Main	The storm made landfall on Friday near Wilmington, a city of about 120,000 squeezed between North Carolina’s Atlantic coastline and the Cape Fear River.
Main_Consequence	On Saturday, its streets were strewn with downed tree limbs and carpeted with leaves and other debris.
Main_Consequence	Electricity remained out for much of the city, known for its historic mansions, with power lines lying across roads like wet strands of spaghetti.

Cause_Specific	(Reuters) - When Oscar-winning deaf actress Marlee Matlin turned to the internet to view a video warning about Hurricane Michael, she was quickly reminded that sign language interpreters are often edited out of broadcast clips and closed captioning seems to be non-existent online.
Distant_Evaluation	“There are 35 million deaf and hard of hearing people and it’s amazing today that there isn’t full access to them,” she told Reuters through an interpreter on Friday in a telephone interview.
Main	Matlin drew attention to emergency communication glitches with disabled people earlier in the week, when she tweeted on Tuesday about the Weather Company’s failure to include closed captioning in reports about the approaching storm.
Cause_Specific	“Dear @weatherchannel I wanted to share this video for the thousands of Deaf and Hard Of Hearing residents in the path of #HurricaneMichael but unfortunately, it’s NOT closed captioned.
Distant_Evaluation	Access to info is VITAL; it’s a life or death matter.
Distant_Evaluation	Thank you,” Matlin wrote.
Cause_Specific	Matlin posted a link to a video produced by the Weather Company, which includes the Weather Channel logo on its website but is separate from the television network.
Main	Emergency notifications about troubles ranging from life-threatening tornadoes to New York City subway delays fail to reach Americans with hearing loss because of the failure to integrate closed captioning on public address systems, she noted.
Distant_Evaluation	“‘There’s not so many of you, so it’s not so important for us.’ That’s the way we feel,” Matlin said.
Distant_Evaluation	“Everything is migrating to the internet.
Cause_Specific	It’s breaking news and you bring up the website video and it’s just the clips.
Cause_Specific	There is no captioning.”
Distant_Evaluation	Even when officials include signers at their news conferences, viewers trying to catch up to the news online later are unable to see them in edited video clips, she said.
Distant_Evaluation	“When they show the mayor or the sheriff, there is always an interpreter next to them, but they show a clip and then it goes away,” Matlin said.
Cause_General	Warning and evacuating people with physical limitations from a fast-moving hurricane requires extraordinary efforts, advocates and state officials said on Friday.
Cause_General	Many disabled people are low income, rely on public transportation and cannot afford private transport or temporary lodging.
Cause_General	Those with physical limitations have difficulty with storm preparation like boarding up homes and storing water bottles.
Cause_General	The more time they have to prepare for a storm the better, but Hurricane Michael’s rapid intensification left thousands with no escape.
Cause_General	The New England Journal of Medicine found “interruption of medical care” was a leading cause of the 3,000 deaths from Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.
Cause_General	Ahead of Hurricane Michael, medical treatments for chronic illnesses including diabetes, asthma and hypertension were sent in “hurricane-specific modules” to primary care health centers near the storm’s path, said Andrew Schroeder, research and analytics director for the non-profit organization Direct Relief.
Cause_General	Each emergency medical pack contained enough medicine to treat 100 patients for 72 hours, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	It remains to be seen if those modules have helped, President of Florida Association of Community Health Centers Andrew Behrman said, because many of the health centers in the storm’s path lost power and were directing patients to shelters.

Distant_Evaluation	“There’s damage to a number of those facilities and one of them, the roof is gone, so whatever was inside of that is not going to be usable,” he said.
Cause_General	Florida’s Agency for Persons with Disabilities (APD), which serves about 3,000 developmentally disabled people affected by Michael, holds conference calls twice a day to check in with people during emergencies, said spokeswoman Melanie Etters.
Cause_General	But without phone service, disabled people have no way to get in touch with specialists or authorities.
Distant_Evaluation	“We had to move quickly and start communicating with people rapidly to make sure people were taking action because it was moving so fast toward the coast,” she said.

Main	ISLAMABAD, Oct. 8 (Xinhua) -- Various events are being held in Pakistan in connection with the 13th anniversary of the devastating earthquake of Oct. 8, 2005 that killed nearly 100,000 people and left millions homeless, mostly in northern areas of the country, local media reported on Monday.
Main	Special prayers, seminars, pictorial exhibitions, candle vigils and awareness walks are being held in schools, colleges, private as well as government institutions to remember the victims of the deadly earthquake and create awareness among the general public to reduce the loss of life and property damage.
Cause_General	People representing all walks of life including social and political workers, lawyers, journalists and members of the business fraternity attended the ceremonies.
Cause_General	The attendees pay tribute to Pakistan armed forces, people and government of Pakistan, the international community and donor agencies for their generous participation in relief and rehabilitation work.
Main	One-minute silence was observed at 8:53 a.m. in the morning and sirens were blown to pay glorious tributes to the victims of history's worst catastrophe.
Main	National flag was being hoisted half-mast on all public buildings of the state to mark the anniversary.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Barrister Iftikhar Gilani, a minister from Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, vowed to accomplish all ongoing reconstruction projects in education sector as early as possible.
Distant_Evaluation	"He said that ""international donors have accomplished some international standard hospitals while work on others is speedily underway."""
Cause_General	The graveyards in the quake-hit areas were flooded with large numbers of people, who were there to offer prayers for the departed souls.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, many people took to Twitter on the 13th anniversary to express their grief over the tragic disaster, with journalists sharing their stories of laborious coverage on the day of deadly earthquake of Oct. 8 in 2005.
Distant_Historical	The 7.6-magnitude quake left tens of thousands injured and over 3.5 million homeless.
Distant_Historical	Approximately 19,000 children were killed in the earthquake mainly due to collapses of school buildings, according to the figures provided by government.
Distant_Historical	The earthquake also demolished over 600,000 houses, more than 6,000 educational institutions, health units and government buildings.

Distant_Evaluation	For months, Gov.
Distant_Evaluation	Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas and other governors have warned that their state National Guards are ill-prepared for the next local disaster, be it a tornado a flash flood or a terrorist's threat, because of large deployments of their soldiers and equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Cause_Specific	Then, last Friday night, a deadly tornado all but cleared the small town of Greensburg off the Kansas map.
Distant_Evaluation	With 80 square blocks of the small farming town destroyed, Ms. Sebelius said her fears had come true: The emergency response was too slow, she said, and there was only one reason.
Cause_General	''As you travel around Greensburg, you'll see that city and county trucks have been destroyed,'' Ms. Sebelius, a Democrat, said Monday.
Cause_General	''The National Guard is one of our first responders.
Distant_Evaluation	They don't have the equipment they need to come in, and it just makes it that much slower.''
Main	For nearly two days after the storm, there was an unmistakable emptiness in Greensburg, a lack of heavy machinery and an army of responders.
Main	By Sunday afternoon, more than a day and a half after the tornado, only about half of the Guard troops who would ultimately respond were in place.
Main	It was not until Sunday night that significant numbers of military vehicles started to arrive, many streaming in a long caravan from Wichita about 100 miles away.
Distant_Evaluation	Ms. Sebelius's comments about the slow response prompted a debate with the White House on Tuesday, which initially said the fault rested with her.
Distant_Evaluation	Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, said the governor should have followed procedure by finding gaps after the storm hit and asking the federal government to fill them -- but did not.
Distant_Evaluation	''If you don't request it, you're not going to get it,'' Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Snow told reporters on Tuesday morning.
Distant_Evaluation	The debate was reminiscent of the Bush administration's skirmishes with Gov.
Distant_Evaluation	Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana, also a Democrat, after Hurricane Katrina.
Cause_General	But after an angry flurry of words, both sides seemed to back down a bit later Tuesday.
Distant_Evaluation	Ms. Sibelius said she now had enough equipment and personnel to deal with the problems in Greensburg, and the White House acknowledged that the governor had requested several items that the federal government supplied, including a mobile command center, a mobile office building, an urban search and rescue team, and coordination of extra Black Hawk helicopters.
Distant_Evaluation	Nonetheless, the governor and officials in other states again expressed concern that the problem could occur again as the stretched National Guard system struggled to respond to disasters at home while also fighting overseas.
Distant_Evaluation	As State Senator Donald Betts Jr., Democrat of Wichita, put it: ''We should have had National Guard troops there right after the tornado hit, securing the place, pulling up debris, to make sure that if there was still life, people could have been saved.
Distant_Evaluation	The response time was too slow, and it's becoming a trend.
Distant_Evaluation	We saw this after Katrina, and it's like history repeating itself.''
Cause_General	The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which came under strong criticism after Hurricane Katrina, seemed to respond more quickly in Kansas.
Main	Several of the agency's mobile disaster recovery centers are in Greensburg assisting residents, and the agency said it had moved in 15,000 gallons of water and 21,000 ready-to-eat meals, enough to feed 10,000 people.
Distant_Evaluation	State officials said the problem with the National Guard's response had more to do with equipment than personnel.
Cause_Specific	In Kansas, the National Guard is operating with 40 percent to 50 percent of its vehicles and heavy machinery, local Guard officials said.
Cause_General	Ordinarily, the Guard would have about 660 Humvees and more than 30 large trucks to traverse difficult terrain and transport heavy equipment.
Cause_Specific	When the tornado struck, the Guard had about 350 Humvees and 15 large trucks, said Maj. Gen. Tod Bunting, the state's adjutant general.
Cause_Specific	The Guard would also usually have 170 medium-scale tactical vehicles used to transport people and supplies -- but now it has fewer than 30, he said.
Cause_General	On the other hand, General Bunting said, it had more cargo trucks than it needed.
Cause_General	The issue is not confined to Kansas.
Cause_General	In Ohio, the National Guard is short of night vision goggles and M-4 rifles, said a Guard spokesman, Dr. Mark Wayda.
Distant_Evaluation	''If we had a tornado hit a small town, we would be fine,'' Dr. Wayda said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''If we had a much larger event, that would become a problem.''
Distant_Evaluation	The California National Guard is similarly concerned about a catastrophic event.
Distant_Evaluation	''Our issue is that we are shortchanged when it comes to equipment,'' said Col. Jon Siepmann, a spokesman for the Guard in California.
Distant_Evaluation	''We have gone from a strategic reserve to a globally deployable force, and yet our equipment resources have been largely the same levels since before the war.''
Distant_Evaluation	In Arkansas, Gov.
Distant_Evaluation	Mike Beebe a Democrat, echoed the concerns of Ms. Sebelius.
Distant_Evaluation	''We have the same problem,'' Mr. Beebe said.
Distant_Evaluation	''We have had a significant decrease in equipment traditionally afforded our National Guard, and it's occasioned by the fact that it's been sent to the Middle East and Iraq.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He added: ''Our first and foremost consideration is to guarantee that our soldiers have the resources, including equipment, to do the job and protect themselves.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Having said that, my preference would be for the federal government to provide that equipment and not strip the state's resources, which could adversely impact the state's mission in times of crisis, which is what happened in Kansas.''
Distant_Historical	Last year, all 50 governors signed a letter to President Bush asking for the immediate re-equipping of Guard units sent overseas.
Distant_Evaluation	But officials in several states, including Kentucky, Minnesota and Texas, said Tuesday that they were not facing equipment shortages.
Cause_General	National Guard units overseas are often assigned engineering missions, and the skills and equipment -- bulldozers and trucks, for example -- are also what might be required to deal with a natural disaster at home.
Distant_Evaluation	White House officials said that the Kansas National Guard had at its disposal in the Midwest and the Plains states, everything it needed.
Cause_General	By Mr.
Cause_General	Snow's count, that included 83,000 National Guard soldiers; 99 bulldozers; 61 loaders; 246 dump trucks and 59 graders.
Distant_Evaluation	''There's a lot of stuff available,'' Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Snow said.
Distant_Evaluation	''So, again, I think this is one where the equipment was available and everybody was moving as rapidly as possible.''
Cause_General	In Congressional testimony, senior National Guard officials have said that since Sept. 11 units under their command had equipment shortages as forces deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.
Cause_General	Responding to concerns that the National Guard would not have sufficient personnel or equipment to respond to natural disasters, Guard leaders and state officials developed plans to ensure that if a state is in short supply of people or gear when a hurricane or tornado strikes, it can borrow from other states.
Distant_Evaluation	But borrowing does not solve every problem, state officials said, and coordination can take time.
Distant_Historical	The destruction from Hurricane Katrina ultimately required the help of 50,000 troops -- and they came from all 50 states.
Distant_Evaluation	Training is another issue.
Distant_Historical	At a Washington news conference in February, Ms. Sebelius said, ''The Guard cannot train on equipment they do not have.''
Distant_Historical	She added later: ''And in a state like Kansas, where tornados, floods, blizzards and wildfires can seemingly happen all at once, we need our Guardsmen to be as prepared as possible.''
Cause_General	Two recent reports have raised questions about Guard preparedness.
Cause_General	An independent military assessment council, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves, released a report in March that stated: ''In particular, the equipment readiness of the Army National Guard is unacceptable and has reduced the capability of the United States to respond to current and additional major contingencies, foreign and domestic.''
Distant_Historical	Another report, released in January by the Government Accountability Office, concluded that the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have ''significantly decreased'' the amount of equipment available for National Guard units not deployed overseas, while the same units face an increasing number of threats at home.
Distant_Evaluation	Late Tuesday, in a statement, Ms. Sebelius repeated her message:
Distant_Evaluation	''I have said for nearly two years, and will continue to say, that we have a looming crisis on our hands when it comes to National Guard equipment in Iraq and our needs here at home.''

Cause_Specific	The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services projected the animal death toll after emergency workers and veterinarians spent days in the field assessing losses at farms following the storm.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I’m just assuming, based on the depth of the water that we had in North Carolina and the amount of rainfall, that we probably will exceed what we had in [Hurricane] Matthew,” Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said in an interview, referring to hog losses.
Cause_General	He spoke on Tuesday after flying over flooded areas, before the department issued its estimates.

Cause_General	Hurricane Florence, which came ashore last Friday with torrential rains, has caused more outdoor hog manure pits to collapse and overflow in North Carolina than Hurricane Matthew did in 2016, according to state data, stoking concern about possible water contamination.
Cause_General	The deaths of 26 people in North Carolina and six in South Carolina have been attributed to the storm.
Cause_Specific	High winds and flooding damaged two chicken farms that supply Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N), the biggest U.S. meat processor, spokesman Worth Sparkman said.
Distant_Evaluation	He said operations were minimally damaged, and the company was looking to relocate chickens that survived to other farms.
Cause_General	WH Group Ltd’s Smithfield Foods Inc [SFIL.UL], the biggest U.S. pork producer, was operating processing plants at limited capacity, after previously closing the world’s largest hog slaughterhouse in Tar Heel, North Carolina, spokeswoman Diana Souder said.
Cause_General	Flood waters inundated the barns and waste pit at one company-owned hog farm in the state, she said.
Cause_General	North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality said on Tuesday that the walls of four pits holding hog waste, known as lagoons, had given way because of the storm, thirteen pits had overflowed due to rain, and nine were inundated by floodwaters.
Distant_Historical	Hurricane Matthew caused a partial structural failure at one lagoon, while none overflowed from rain and 14 were inundated by floodwaters, according to the industry group NC Pork Council.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	More lagoons were at risk of overflowing in the days ahead, state data showed, including 30 that are filled to the brim with waste and water, and another 25 with zero to three inches of space to spare.
Cause_General	There are more than 3,300 lagoons in North Carolina, said Andy Curliss, chief executive for the NC Pork Council.
Cause_General	Hog producers, including Smithfield, lowered the levels of waste in lagoons before the storm, but up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain overwhelmed some farms.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Matt Wellington, antibiotics program director of U.S. PIRG, a federation of public interest groups, said the release of waste from lagoons could spread antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
Distant_Evaluation	Farmers raise hogs with antibiotics, which can be found in their waste, he said.
Distant_Historical	Sampling waterways in eastern North Carolina after Hurricane Matthew showed a temporary increase in concentrations of some bacteria and pollutants in spots, according to a 2017 report from the state’s Department of Environmental Quality.

Main	KIGALI, Sept. 12 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda on Wednesday announced plans for sustainable green investments aimed at improving environmental and climate change management in order to reduce the country's vulnerability to natural hazards.
Main	Speaking at a national forum on re-greening Rwanda, Francine Tumushime, minister of lands and forestry, said that green investments such as forest cover restoration, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and reduction of the use of charcoal and fuel wood will help the country to mitigate natural disaster risk.
Main	"""From January to June this year, Rwanda was severely affected by natural disasters caused by heavy rain which claimed at least 222 people."
Main	"We are putting in much effort to invest in green economy to mitigate this catastrophe in future,"" she noted."
Cause_General	The one day meeting focused on discussing sustainable ways to boost green economy and reduce environmental risks while improving human well-being and social equity.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	According to De bonheur Jeanne d'Arc, Rwandan minister disaster management and refugee affairs, strengthening risk management through re-greening Rwanda is essential for advancing green growth in light of climatic change.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Working together, coordinating our efforts towards greening Rwanda is one of the mitigation measures to reduce disaster risks,"" she added."
Distant_Evaluation	She encouraged all key stakeholders to support the recovery and rebuilding efforts in all the areas affected by natural disasters across the country.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As part of the efforts to improve green growth in the country, Vincent Biruta, Rwandan minister of environment, said that the government of Rwanda aims to carry out environmental management initiatives that will help permanently address disasters related to climate change.
Distant_Evaluation	"""With more natural disasters looming as we enter the rainy season, it is important that all stakeholders do what they can to help protect the environment and mitigate natural disasters,"" he added."
Cause_General	The meeting brought together government officials, representatives from the private sector, civil society organizations, non-governmental organizations and development partners among others.

Main	NEW DELHI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - From helicopters plucking families from rooftops to fishermen ferrying villagers to safety, India’s response to deadly floods in Kerala has won praise, but experts say unchecked development contributed to the disaster.
Cause_Specific	Nearly 400 people have died since August 8 in the worst floods to hit the coastal state in a century, with dozens more missing and about a million forced into temporary camps after roads, bridges and homes were swept away.
Cause_Specific	As torrential rains began, the army, navy and national disaster response force teams swung into action, battling neck-high waters and mudslides to bring food and drinking water to tens of thousands of marooned people.
Distant_Evaluation	But it was the volunteer efforts that drew particular praise - from the fisherman who got on all fours and made a human step for women to clamber onto a boat, to prisoners preparing thousands of chapatis for homeless victims.
Distant_Evaluation	“The whole society came together, not only those in Kerala but from across the country,” said Vikrant, head of Sphere India, a network of humanitarian agencies.
Main	“Regular, common people - right from your fishermen to students to judges – came out to help, and that contributed in saving many people,” Vikrant, who goes by one name, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Distant_Evaluation	“We have not seen this in other states previously,” he added, recalling floods in southern Tamil Nadu state in 2015 and in the northern mountainous state of Uttarakhand, where nearly 6,000 people were killed in 2013.
Distant_Evaluation	Flooding on the scale seen in Kerala could have killed 10 times more people a decade ago, but India’s disaster management capacity has improved significantly in that time, said Chandra Bhushan of the Centre for Science and Environment think tank.
Main	“The relief and rescue response in Kerala has been exemplary,” he said.
Main	“National government to state government to local authorities to NGOs to church, temple, fishermen, children - everyone participated and this must be recognized and lessons should be learned from this kind of response.”
Distant_Evaluation	‘WAKE-UP CALL’
Cause_Specific	Kerala received over 40 percent more rainfall than usual this monsoon, forcing authorities to release water from dozens of dams, which compounded the flooding.
Cause_Specific	But other man-made problems were also to blame.
Cause_Specific	Kerala is one of India’s wealthiest states and has seen rapid unplanned development in recent years, with luxury resorts, residential complexes, power plants and mines built on floodplains, often in violation of the rules.
Cause_Specific	Critics say such unregulated construction on Kerala’s river banks has caused deforestation and destruction of the mangroves that previously acted as shields against coastal erosion, increasing the risk of floods and landslides.
Cause_Specific	“The floods were inevitable, but the impact in Kerala was exacerbated by human influence: bad dam management, bad planning, deforestation and destruction of natural habitats,” said Bhushan.
Distant_Evaluation	“We must start considering what is the ecological cost of development.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan has vowed to build “a new Kerala” instead of restoring old structures, with the help of experts on planning and management from across India.
Distant_Evaluation	“We have to be more cautious, we have to take steps to prevent such occurrences.
Distant_Evaluation	Calamities would haunt us in future too,” he told the Indian Express newspaper in an interview published on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	Analysts, however, say Kerala ignored warnings of looming floods, including by ecologist Madhav Gadgil in a 2011 report that also set out ways the damage could be averted.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Kerala is estimated to have suffered damages of nearly $3 billion, which analysts say could rise 10-fold as waters recede and flood recovery begins - from clean-up and reconstruction to restoring livelihoods for farmers who lost land and crops.
Distant_Evaluation	Experts say authorities must install an early flood warning system, incentivize flood-control projects like stormwater management, plant more trees and protect mangroves and wetlands to make communities more resilient to shocks.
Distant_Evaluation	“We must focus on how communities can thrive in the face of floods and increasing uncertainty around weather events,” said Nathanial Matthews, a director at the Global Resilience Partnership.
Distant_Evaluation	“These kind of calamities need to act as a wake-up call to everyone.”
Cause_General	HONOLULU (Reuters) - Hawaii was spared a direct hit by a major hurricane as Lane, once a monster tempest, rapidly weakened into a tropical storm, even as it unleashed severe flooding on the Big Island and threatened to drench Oahu and Maui.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lane, with maximum sustained winds diminishing to near 70 mph (110 kph), was forecast to slowly make its nearest approach to land just west of the U.S. Pacific island chain over the weekend, bringing tropical storm conditions to Maui and the state’s most populous island, Oahu, late on Friday.
Main	More than two feet (60 cm) of rain had fallen in a 36-hour period by Friday night on the windward side of the island of Hawaii, popularly known as the Big Island, where the Weather Service reported “catastrophic flooding.” More than 40 inches of rain was recorded in Piihonua and Waiakea on the island late on Friday, the weather service said.
Main_Consequence	Flash flooding and mudslides on the Big Island forced road closures and evacuations as police and emergency crews conducted numerous rescues of people stranded in vehicles and homes by high water on Friday.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Roads all over are impassable due to extreme flooding,” said Hawaii resident Lili Koi on Twitter late on Friday night.
Distant_Anecdotal	“That means ambulances and even police are not able to get through.

Main	URUMQI, Aug. 3 (Xinhua) -- Twenty people have died in floods caused by torrential rain in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on Tuesday, authorities said Friday.
Main	Another eight people remain missing after the downpours hit Qincheng Township in Hami from 6 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. on July 31, according to the regional disaster relief headquarters.
Cause_General	Over 8,700 houses, farmland, roads, railway lines, and power and telecommunication facilities were damaged in the floods.
Cause_General	In one hour rainfall reached 110 mm, while the previous highest recorded level was only 52.4 mm in the area, said the headquarters.
Cause_Specific	The floods triggered a partial breach of a reservoir, as the floodwater flowing into the reservoir reached 1,848 cubic meters per second, tripling the maximum of 537 cubic meters per second designed to withstand the worst flood in 300 years.
Cause_General	Li Zhong, from the headquarters, said the regional Party committee and government have set up headquarters for relief operations.
Cause_General	More than 3,000 people including officials, soldiers, and medical staff have taken part in the efforts so far.
Cause_General	Over 5,500 residents have been evacuated.
Cause_General	They have been provided with tents, daily necessities and medical treatment in temporary relocation sites.
Cause_General	Ministry of Emergency Management and local government departments have sent tents, beds, quilts, raincoats, boots, water, food and medicine to people affected by floods.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, sanitation and epidemic prevention, traffic and power departments have also dispatched personnel to deal with post-disaster problems.
Cause_General	Traffic has resumed on roads damaged by floods, and power supplies and communication facilities have been reconnected.
Main	TOKYO, March 23 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.1 struck off the Pacific coast of Miyagi Prefecture in the southern Tohoku Region of Japan, the weather agency here said Friday.
Cause_General	According to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), the temblor occurred at 6:32 a.m. local time, at a latitude of 38.9 degrees north and a longitude of 142.1 degrees east.
Cause_General	The offshore quake originated at a depth of 50 km, the JMA also said.
Cause_General	The quake measured 4 on Japan's seismic intensity scale which peaks at 7 in parts of Miyagi Prefecture and registered 3 on the scale in neighboring Iwate Prefecture, according to the JMA.
Cause_General	The JMA, however, has not issued a tsunami warning as a result of the moderately powerful temblor.
Cause_General	There have been no reports, as yet, by local officials, of injury or damage to persons or property as a result of the quake.
Cause_General	No abnormalities have been reported at nuclear power plants in the region, including at the crippled Daiichi nuclear facility in nearby Fukushima Prefecture, in northeast Japan.
Cause_Specific	The Road Home, the Louisiana grant program for homeowners who lost their houses to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, is expected to cost far more than the $7.5 billion provided by the federal government, in part because many more families have applied than officials had anticipated.
Main	As a result, Louisiana officials on Tuesday night set a July 31 deadline for applicants, who can receive up to $150,000 to repair or rebuild their houses.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With the cutoff date, the state hopes to be able to figure out how much more money it needs to pay for the program; the shortfall is projected to be $2.9 billion.
Cause_General	The financial woes of the Road Home have set off a frenzy of finger-pointing between federal and state officials, who blame one another for the projected shortfall.
Cause_General	But it has stirred something close to despair among some Louisiana residents, who were already bemoaning the sluggish way the program has given out the money it does have; only 22,000 families statewide, out of 140,000 applicants, have received grants so far, for a total of $1.3 billion.
Distant_Evaluation	The new problem has reinforced the fears of many in New Orleans that they are being abandoned by the federal government, even as it acknowledges that its levee system failed during Hurricane Katrina.
Distant_Evaluation	''There's no way they can ever make everybody whole, but they need to fix the thing they broke,'' said Frank A. Silvestri, a New Orleans lawyer and co-founder of the Citizens' Road Home Action Team, which has been critical of the program.
Cause_General	Evidence that the program is likely to run out of money has been building for several weeks as the state has finally begun making a significant number of grants since the inception of the Road Home nine months ago.
Cause_Specific	The grants have averaged about $76,000, which is more than the roughly $60,000 the state predicted last August.
Cause_Specific	State officials say that many more houses turned out to have had severe damage than federal data indicated back when the program was created.
Distant_Evaluation	They have also been surprised by a recent surge in applications, which are running at several hundred a day, almost two years after the storms, said Gentry Brann, director of communications for the program.
Distant_Evaluation	The state also expected private insurance companies to cover a larger percentage of the damage, said Walter J. Leger Jr., a lawyer and member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which created the Road Home program.
Distant_Evaluation	''Anecdotally, the companies aren't paying,'' Mr. Leger said.
Cause_Specific	''National Flood Insurance paid out, but private insurers didn't.''
Cause_General	Insurance benefits are generally subtracted from grants awarded by the program.
Distant_Evaluation	But Mr. Leger and other state officials concede that many homeowners may have preferred to try to get larger grants from the Road Home, rather than fight with their insurers.
Cause_Specific	The Bush administration contends that the state itself created the shortfall by paying for home damage caused by wind, rather than limiting the program to flood damage.
Cause_General	Insurance policies are more likely to cover wind damage than flood damage.
Cause_Specific	The decision to pay for wind damage added about 43,000 houses to the likely total covered by the program, at a cost of about $2.6 billion, according to data from the office of Donald E. Powell, President Bush's coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding.
Distant_Evaluation	Even so, Mr. Powell ''is not opposed to additional funding -- if the state can make a clear case for more funds,'' his spokeswoman, Susan Aspey, wrote in an e-mail message.
Distant_Evaluation	''He wants to get this resolved as quickly as possible for the people of Louisiana, and he's indicated his willingness to sit down with the governor and her staff to work towards that end.''
Distant_Evaluation	State officials, from the governor on down, say the program has always covered wind damage, and that they do not understand why Mr. Powell is raising the issue so late in the game.
Cause_General	The state had a similar run-in with the Department of Housing and Urban Development over the way it paid out the grant money, and ended up changing the program in April.
Cause_General	Louisiana is also fighting the Federal Emergency Management Agency for more than $1 billion it was counting on for the Road Home program.
Cause_General	FEMA says it cannot release the money -- intended for hazard-mitigation efforts like elevating houses -- because the Road Home discriminates against younger people by exempting people 65 and older from a requirement that grant recipients live in their rebuilt houses for three years.
Cause_General	Further complicating the financial picture is the fact that the state treasury is running a budget surplus of about $3 billion, which some in Washington have argued should be used to bail out the Road Home.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A United States Senate subcommittee that held a hearing on the program last week is likely to recommend ways to fix it in a report to be released in June, said Stephanie Allen, a spokeswoman for Senator Mary L. Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who is chairwoman of the subcommittee.
Distant_Evaluation	''She doesn't think the federal government should be responsible for the entire bailout,'' Ms. Allen said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It should be a combined effort of the federal government and the state.''
Main	VIENTIANE, Aug. 8 (Xinhua) -- The Lao government has announced it will examine the safety standards applied to the construction of hydropower dams across the country following the deadly disaster caused by the collapse of a dam in Attapeu province in the south, local media reported Wednesday.
Cause_Specific	The cabinet made the announcement shortly after its two-day extraordinary meeting which ended on Tuesday.
Cause_Specific	Chaired by Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith, the meeting heard of the progress made in dealing with the aftermath of the disaster in Sanamxay district of Attapeu province.
Main	The meeting agreed to carry out inspections into all dams, both those that are completed and whose construction is underway.
Main	The Ministry of Energy and Mines will work with the Ministry of Public Works and Transport, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, the Ministry of Science and Technology and international experts in carrying out the inspections.
Cause_General	Any irregularities found in the design or construction standard of a dam must be reported to the government on a case-by-case basis, so that improvements can be made, local daily Vientiane Times reported on Wednesday.
Main	The Lao government has also decided to suspend the consideration of new investments in hydropower projects in order to review its hydropower development strategy and plans.
Cause_General	The reviewed strategy and plans will be used as a reference for future direction, the report said.
Cause_General	The meeting, attended by cabinet members, agreed to establish a taskforce committee to lead the investigation into the reason of the collapse of saddle dam D, one of five auxiliary dams at the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydropower project in Attapeu, some 560 km southeast of capital Vientiane.
Cause_Specific	The failure of the dam on July 23 flooded 13 villages in Sanamxay district, leaving 34 people dead as of Tuesday while 97 villagers still missing, and over 6,000 homeless.
Cause_General	The investigation committee is chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Government Inspection Authority Bounthong Chitmany.
Distant_Evaluation	The committee welcomes the help of international experts in carrying out the investigation and verifying the cause of the dam fracture.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The committee will also invite representatives of the governments of South Korea and Thailand, whose companies were stakeholders in the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydropower project, to provide consultation and observe the investigation process.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	This will ensure the thoroughness and transparency of the investigation so that the findings are recognized and accepted internationally, the report said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Once the findings are made known, the government will proceed with the next steps.
Cause_General	The meeting also agreed to establish a high-level committee, supervised by Bounthong, to investigate the responsibility of state authorities for the dam failure, as well as those in charge of issuing warnings ahead of the disaster.
Cause_General	The National Ad Hoc Committee in charge of dealing with the aftermath of the Sanamxay flood was told to collect comprehensive information on the losses and damage caused by the disaster.
Cause_General	The Ad Hoc Committee was also entrusted to draw up short-term and longer term plans to recover the damage and losses and report to the government so that investment in the recovery could be prioritized.

Main	TOKYO, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the strong earthquake that rocked Japan's Hokkaido on Thursday has risen to 42, while one person in the town of Atsuma, one of the hardest-hit areas by the quake, is still missing, the Japanese government said on Sunday.
Cause_General	The government's top spokesperson, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, told a press conference that a total of 41,000 people and 74 helicopters were searching for the one last missing person and helping the disaster-hit areas.
Cause_General	At one point after the powerful quake on Thursday, some 2.95 million homes in Hokkaido were without electricity as the whole prefecture suffered a power outage.
Cause_General	Suga said that power had been restored in almost all areas except for a few households that are difficult to reach.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He urged homes and offices already with power to cut usage by about 20 percent to prepare for power shortage as demand will rise on weekdays.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As heavy rain is expected to continue in some of the quake-hit areas on Monday, he urged the residents to be wary of possible landslides and other secondary disasters as well as aftershocks.
Cause_Specific	An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7 struck Hokkaido prefecture at 3:08 a.m. local time Thursday (1808 GMT Wednesday).
Cause_General	The quake logged the maximum 7 on Japan's seismic intensity scale, marking the first time for Hokkaido since the seismic scale was revised in 1996, according to Japan's weather agency.
Distant_Anecdotal	MABI, Japan - (Reuters) - When Isao Akutagawa moved to the sleepy riverside town of Mabi in western Japan 45 years ago, it seemed like the perfect suburb to raise his children.
Distant_Anecdotal	Land was cheap and he could drive to his job in nearby Kurashiki City.
Distant_Anecdotal	As he built his home next to rice paddies 2 kilometers from the Odagawa river bank, he heard stories about a flood the year before, but didn’t pay much notice until local politicians began warning residents it could happen again.
Distant_Anecdotal	“They told us years ago that the Odagawa river levees might break,” said Akutagawa, 79, as he mopped muddy water out of his living room.
Distant_Anecdotal	His home was submerged in a sudden flood earlier this month when heavy rain caused multiple levees to break.
Main	Torrential rains across western Japan this month triggered floods and landslides that killed more than 200 people and left over a dozen missing in Japan’s worst weather disaster in 36 years.
Main	Mabi, which merged with Kurashiki in 2005, was one of the hardest hit, accounting for most of the 51 killed in Kurashiki.
Cause_Specific	More than a quarter of it was inundated, with floodwaters reaching as high as 4.8 meters (16 feet) in some neighborhoods.
Main	Interviews with more than a dozen residents, officials and experts show how multiple failures increased Mabi’s death toll: flood-control plans were delayed for decades; residents often didn’t understand warnings about the risks; and an evacuation order for the worst-hit area came just minutes before confirmation that a levee had failed.
Distant_Anecdotal	“We had our local politicians working for years to change the flow of that river,” Akutagawa said.
Distant_Historical	A flood control project finally won approval in 2010 and construction was set to start this autumn.
Distant_Anecdotal	“If they had started earlier, even four or five years earlier, we wouldn’t have this,” he added.
Distant_Historical	Kurashiki City officials said they had asked Japan’s land ministry to start work on the project every year since at least 2005.
Distant_Evaluation	But it was not deemed high enough priority.
Distant_Evaluation	However, officials in the city’s emergency management office said they did not blame the central government for the delay.
Distant_Evaluation	“The land ministry has to make their decision after seeing all the requests sent in from around the country.
Distant_Evaluation	Every area, not just ours, make these requests hoping that our river gets picked,” said Hiroshi Kono, an emergency management officer at Kurashiki City.
Distant_Evaluation	“Of course, it would have made us very happy if ours had been selected sooner.”
Distant_Evaluation	Hiroshi Yamauchi, an official at the land ministry’s Chugoku Regional Development Bureau in Hiroshima, told Reuters his agency had “followed proper procedures,” but that it was common for large-scale river projects to take years to complete.
Distant_Evaluation	Competition for a dwindling budget was partly behind the delay, as was an environmental impact study, said Kairyu Takahashi, head of the prefectural legislature, and a member of a committee that discusses regional public works projects.
Distant_Evaluation	“I feel powerless that I wasn’t able to make the government take action,” he said, choking up with emotion.
Distant_Evaluation	“If we had somehow completed it in time, this may not have happened.”
Distant_Evaluation	At a news conference on Friday, Keiichi Ishii, who heads the ministry of land, infrastructure and transport, which oversees flood prevention projects, declined to address whether the high death toll in Mabi was a preventable “human disaster” or who was responsible.
Distant_Evaluation	“We recognize that there’s a need to look into steps we can take to reduce the damage from disasters like this even a little bit,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said at a separate news conference last week as the regional death toll mounted.

Cause_General	DECADES OF DELAY
Distant_Historical	Many people moved to Mabi after the floods of 1972 and 1976 as flatlands next to two main rivers were developed into a bedroom town.
Distant_Historical	Mabi grew to be a quiet district of about 23,000 people.
Distant_Evaluation	Elderly residents said they knew about flood risks, but had never seen waters rise much higher than knee-level.
Cause_General	Still, calls to improve flood control date back decades.
Distant_Historical	Early proposals, dating as far back as 1968, called for a river bypass and a weir, or small dam, to supply water to farms and reduce flood risks.
Distant_Evaluation	Resistance from residents on the southern side of the Odagawa river over being cut off from groundwater stalled the plans, Takahashi said.
Cause_General	And in the last 20 years, public works spending has declined sharply, falling about 60 percent nationwide from a peak of 14.9 trillion yen in the fiscal year ending in March 1999 to about 6 trillion yen in the current fiscal year, government data show.
Distant_Historical	In 2014, 28 billion yen was allocated for a 30-year plan that included a bypass between the Odagawa and Takahashi rivers.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Work on that 10-year project was scheduled to get under way later this year.
Distant_Historical	MAPPING DISASTER
Distant_Historical	Kurashiki City, like all municipalities across Japan, was required under a 2005 law to create “hazard maps” outlining areas at high risk of flooding, landslides and other disasters, and the locations of evacuation centers.
Distant_Historical	Two years ago, Kurashiki City drafted its own colorful hazard maps.
Distant_Historical	The maps were accurate; large swathes of Mabi marked as risky areas on the maps almost perfectly match the areas overrun by gushing floodwaters.
Cause_General	But there were two problems: the city assumed a pattern of prolonged rain over a wide area rather than an intense concentrated downpour as actually occurred, according to online planning documents, and residents say they paid little attention to the maps.
Cause_Specific	A near-record 138.5 millimeters of rain fell on July 6 in Kurashiki, second only to the 183.5 millimeters recorded on Sept. 3, 2011, according to weather agency data.
Cause_Specific	Early the next morning, waters broke through levees on the Odagawa and Takamagawa rivers, unleashing flood waters.
Distant_Evaluation	Some residents said they had simply ignored the hazard maps; after all, rainfall is relatively rare in Okayama Prefecture, which is known as the “Land of Sunshine.”
Distant_Anecdotal	“To me, it was just another routine document from the public office,” said Shigezo Kaneko, 80, who was rescued by boat after waters came close to the first-floor ceiling of his two-story house.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I guess I wasn’t really vigilant.”
Cause_Specific	‘NOT IN TIME’
Distant_Historical	In 2015, Japan’s Central Land Ministry came up with a policy to better cope with disasters, which included training local authorities on when to issue warnings.
Cause_General	But advisories and orders to evacuate are left up to local authorities.
Cause_Specific	Kurashiki Mayor Kaori Ito announced the first evacuation order, for the area south of the Odagawa river, at 11:45 p.m. At 1:30 a.m. the next day, using loudspeakers, mobile phone alerts, and television and radio messages, the city ordered residents in the heavily populated area north of the river to seek shelter.
Cause_Specific	That order came just four minutes before confirmation of the first levee failure, on a small Takamagawa river.
Distant_Evaluation	Ito, asked about the timing at a news conference, expressed regret but said she had gone by the book.
Error	Slideshow (23 Images)
Distant_Evaluation	“It (the order) was issued based on the condition of the river and in line with standards (for issuance),” she was quoted as saying by domestic media.
Cause_General	Reuters was unable to reach Ito last week for further comment about the decision.
Distant_Anecdotal	Although his family escaped, Atsushi Yamashita, 63, could not persuade one of his neighbors, a man in his 90s, to leave his house just 30 meters from the Odagawa river.
Distant_Anecdotal	The man was later found dead.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Something similar might happen again in a few years,” said Yamashita as workers slowly cleared a mound of rubble in front of his home.
Distant_Anecdotal	“My wife says she doesn’t want to live here anymore.”
Main	Louisiana on Friday picked one of the nation's most prominent education reformers to run the troubled school district of New Orleans, as schools here continue to grapple with physical and administrative damage from Hurricane Katrina.
Cause_Specific	The new superintendent, Paul G. Vallas, who is credited with changes in school systems in Chicago and, most recently, in Philadelphia, was chosen to take on what is seen as one of the more singular challenges in American education: creating a working school district where many of the buildings are ruined, many of the teachers are missing and thousands of students might return suddenly.
Distant_Evaluation	When they do, they will be among the neediest -- the poorest and lowest-achieving -- in the nation.
Cause_General	As a superintendent in Philadelphia and Chicago, Mr. Vallas raised test scores with the help of after-school programs, new schools and revised curricula.
Cause_General	He is generally regarded by schools experts as one of the more energetic practitioners in the field.
Distant_Evaluation	But speaking Friday in a shuttered school in the Lower Ninth Ward, he seemed to recognize the special difficulty of this task.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''I've got to start delivering right away,'' Mr. Vallas told reporters and state officials, including Gov.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Kathleen Babineaux Blanco.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''We've got to get qualified people in the classrooms.
Distant_Evaluation	We not only have the problem of deep poverty; we have the problem of children who have been traumatized.''
Distant_Evaluation	In his remarks, he made it clear that the challenge posed by the New Orleans district was irresistible to a seasoned school professional.
Distant_Evaluation	''Why this job at this time?''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Vallas said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''You've got an opportunity to create a new school system.''
Distant_Evaluation	Asked what his biggest immediate challenge would be, Mr. Vallas said: ''Facilities.
Distant_Evaluation	Fixing schools.
Distant_Evaluation	From what I've heard, it's facilities, facilities, facilities.
Distant_Evaluation	Clearly the hurricane has done damage, but there has been neglect'' even before the storm.
Cause_Specific	Mr. Vallas comes to a school district that has followed a tortuous path because of the hurricane and a storm of academic, financial and administrative problems it had before that: a revolving door of superintendents, millions in misspent federal money and test scores that were the lowest in the state.
Distant_Historical	Because of those difficulties, the state took over the district after the hurricane in 2005.
Cause_General	The district now consists of only 22 schools out of the original 128, with loose jurisdiction over an additional 17 charter schools.
Cause_General	Another 17 schools are run or chartered by the Orleans Parish School Board, which once ran the entire district.
Cause_General	The rest are closed.
Cause_General	Mr. Vallas was chief executive for the school district in Philadelphia and earned generally high marks for his academic achievements, though a budget shortfall of $73 million cast a cloud over his tenure.
Cause_General	He more than doubled fifth-grade math proficiency after arriving there in 2002, though gains in reading and in high school measures were smaller.
Distant_Historical	In Chicago, where he was in charge of the schools from 1995 to 2001, similar gains were made.
Distant_Evaluation	The success or failure of the school district in New Orleans is widely seen as an important symbol of the city's recovery.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The challenge will be different from those Mr. Vallas has faced previously: more than half of fourth graders at nine schools in the district recently surveyed by Louisiana State University were below grade level in reading.
Cause_General	At two schools, every fourth grader was below grade level in math.
Cause_General	In one fourth-grade class, only 22 percent read at grade level.
Cause_General	These difficulties were in addition to widely reported shortcomings the schools faced as they moved unsteadily through their first months last fall: lack of teachers, lack of textbooks, missing supplies and fighting.
Cause_General	Robin Jarvis, the Baton Rouge official Governor Blanco chose to run the district, often seemed overwhelmed.
Cause_General	Ms. Jarvis announced her resignation a few days ago.
Cause_General	The Times-Picayune of New Orleans reported this week that the district had spent barely a tenth of the $241 million allocated by the federal government to rebuild schools, and as a result was facing a shortage of classroom space to handle the influx of students expected later in the year.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	To accommodate up to 10,000 new students by the fall, said the state education superintendent, Paul G. Pastorek, the district needs to hire about 600 teachers, rebuild 10 schools and get prefabricated classrooms into shape.
Distant_Evaluation	The challenge is sizable, he said: ''It is hard to get teachers to come to a hurricane-ravaged city.''

Main	HANOI (Reuters) - The death toll from floods and landslides triggered by tropical storm Son Tinh rose to 27 on Tuesday, and seven people are still missing, the government’s Disaster Management Authority said.
Distant_Historical	With a long coastline, Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding, with 389 people killed last year in natural disasters such as floods and landslides, according to government statistics.
Cause_Specific	Though tropical storm Son Tinh weakened to a tropical depression by the time it reached Vietnam last week, the torrential rains it brought caused heavy flooding and landslides in many parts of northern Vietnam.
Cause_Specific	Some areas in the outskirts of the capital Hanoi remain submerged.
Main	The remote mountainous province of Yen Bai has suffered the heaviest casualties in the latest floods and landslides, with 13 people reportedly killed, 18 injured and four missing, the disaster management agency said in a statement.
Cause_General	The floods and landslides have also damaged and submerged more than 12,000 houses, more than 90,000 hectares (222,395 acres) of crops, mostly paddy, and cut off traffic to several parts of northern Vietnam, the agency said.
Cause_General	Last month, heavy rains triggered flash floods and landslides which killed 24 people in the remote and mountainous northern provinces of Lai Chau and Ha Giang.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The agency urged the authorities and people to keep vigilant for more floods and landslides over the coming days.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	According to the National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting, heavy rain is forecast to continue in the northern part of the country until early August.
Main	(Reuters) - Rescuers pulled people from inundated cars on flooded streets near Baltimore on Wednesday as heavy rain soaked the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast for a fifth day, swelling rivers, closing roads and imperiling homes.
Main_Consequence	Across the country, where separate downpours soaked parts of Colorado, a woman was found dead from apparent drowning in floodwaters that swept a basement apartment in suburban Denver, authorities said.
Main	Heavy rains on the Eastern seaboard fell overnight from central New York state south through eastern North Carolina, where the National Weather Service forecast that a new round of downpours could cause more flooding.
Cause_General	Eastern Virginia and Pennsylvania were also hard hit.
Main_Consequence	Emergency workers around Baltimore pulled people from at least three vehicles stuck in floodwater as deep as 3 feet (0.9 m), police and fire officials said on Twitter.
Distant_Evaluation	A National Weather Service bulletin warned the public to say away from high water, saying: “It doesn’t take much water to sweep away a person or vehicle.”
Main_Consequence	Authorities closed highways and roads in parts of Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia because of flooding.
Cause_General	“With the rainfall we have seen over the last week, the ground is very saturated, so any additional rainfall we receive ... really has nowhere to go,” NWS meteorologist Brandon Fling said.
Main	The weather service said as much as 14 inches (36 cm) of rain had fallen along the East Coast since Saturday, swelling waterways well above flood levels.
Cause_General	Local news video showed water streaming into homes and businesses and reaching the tops of automobiles as rescue crews worked to save motorists.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It just happened out of nowhere, and next thing my car was just shut off, and I’m like, ‘What do I do now?’” Zachary Reichert told NBC News after being rescued from his flooded Jeep in Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I can’t swim in the first place, so I wasn’t jumping into those waters.”
Main_Consequence	Airports in New York and Philadelphia reported delays of more than an hour.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Downpours and possible showers were forecast to linger across the region for several more days.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Separately, parts of Colorado were drenched with rain on Wednesday morning, where officials warned of flash flooding and debris in areas recently scarred by wildfires.
Main_Consequence	In the Denver suburb of Englewood, a 32-year-old woman died on Wednesday of injuries “consistent with drowning” after floodwaters inundated the basement apartment where she was staying, the Arapahoe County Coroner’s Office said.

Main	HANOI, July 20 (Xinhua) -- Downpour and flooding triggered by Typhoon Son Tinh killed eight people and left 20 others missing in Vietnam's central and northern regions, the country's Central Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control said on Friday evening.
Cause_General	The rain and flooding also destroyed or swept away hundreds of houses, damaged many roads in three northern province of Yen Bai, Son La and Quang Ninh and the two central provinces of Thanh Hoa and Nghe An, and inundated over 80,000 hectares of rice.
Main	Yen Bai was the hardest hit by the rain and flooding, seeing six people die, 18 people listed as missing, and over 600 damaged houses.
Cause_General	The flooding and landslides on many sections of national and provincial roads in the province disrupted traffic for hours.
Cause_Specific	Over the past two days, Typhoon Son Tinh, which rapidly weakened into a tropical depression, has brought torrential rain and high levels of waters in rivers and reservoir lakes to the two regions.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	According to Vietnam's National Center for Hydro-meteorological Forecasting, heavy rain may last for the next few days in the regions, and more flash floods and landslides are likely to hit Thanh Hoa and Nghe An.

Main	HARARE, Sept. 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa has approved a 64 million U.S. dollars budget for immediate needs in the fight against a cholera outbreak that has so far killed at least 30 people in the capital Harare, a Cabinet minister has said.
Main	Funds will also be used to fight typhoid which has also hit the city and other parts of the country, chairperson of the Cabinet committee on emergency preparedness and disaster management July Moyo told state run newspaper Herald.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It is anticipated that well-wishers will donate to the fund, with donations such as fuel, protective clothing, cean up tools, refuse receptacles, food and water purification chemicals being channeled through the Harare Town Clerk's office.
Cause_General	He said cash donations should be made to the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development, whose minister Mthuli Ncube last week announced the establishment of a crowd funding initiative to help fight the outbreak.
Cause_Specific	Moyo said government interventions followed Mnangagwa's declaration of the outbreak as a state of disaster on Sept. 12.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Pursuant to this development, our preparedness in terms of geographical coverage is national while in terms of response more focus will be on the cholera hotspots,"" he said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He said in the worst case scenario an estimated 100,000 people, including those in transit, could be affected, but the most likely scenario was about 50,000.
Distant_Historical	The worst cholera outbreak to hit the country took place from Aug. 2008 to June 2009 when 98,596 cases of cholera were reported, resulting in 4,369 deaths.
Main	Torrential rains in southern China have unleashed surging floodwaters that have swept through small cities and farming villages, claiming at least 66 lives, forcing nearly 600,000 people to be relocated and destroying millions of dollars in property, the state news media reported Sunday.
Main_Consequence	Rescue efforts were under way in the southern provinces of Hunan, Guizhou, Guangdong and Guangxi, as the floodwaters swept through mountainous regions prone to landslides.
Main_Consequence	Nearly nine million people were directly affected by the flooding, and factories and other enterprises have been closed in some areas, according to Xinhua, China's official news agency.
Cause_Specific	Heavy rains began last Wednesday in southern China and deluged the region into the weekend.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	By Sunday, the rains had subsided in Guangxi Province, but more flooding was possible as water levels in local rivers were expected to keep rising for several days.
Main_Consequence	Guangxi had reported eight deaths as well as extensive property damage, including the destruction of more than 3,700 homes and thousands of acres of cropland.
Distant_Evaluation	Flooding is an annual early summer event in southern China and a reminder of the country's contradictory weather patterns.
Cause_General	Even as the south is awash in floodwaters, other regions of China are gripped by record drought.
Cause_General	In the southwestern corner of Sichuan Province, drought is so severe that trucks are delivering emergency water supplies.
Cause_General	Major cities along the southern coast, including the manufacturing export centers in Guangdong Province, were not reporting any flooding problems.
Main	But water was chest high in other parts of the province, including Zi Jin County, where some towns were experiencing the worst flooding in 50 years.
Main_Consequence	In one town, state news media showed a group of men carrying a pregnant woman atop a makeshift barge through waist-deep water.
Distant_Evaluation	Earlier this year, Chinese experts warned that southern China could experience serious flooding this summer, particularly along the middle and lower sections of the Yangtze River.
Distant_Evaluation	In spring, there was major drought on the upper reaches of the river, and the experts warned that flooding could follow.
Main_Consequence	China Central Television estimated property damages at 1.5 billion yuan, or about $198 million, for the region.

Main	BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- The ministries of Finance and of Emergency Management have allocated 170 million yuan (about 25 million U.S. dollars) to help with flood relief work in west China's Sichuan and Gansu provinces.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The money will be used to relocate people affected by the floods, reconstruct collapsed houses and provide financial aid for flood victims, said a source of the Ministry of Emergency Management.
Cause_Specific	China's disaster relief authorities launched a level-IV emergency response plan last week in the two provinces to address rainstorm and flood disasters.
Cause_Specific	About 932,000 people in Sichuan Province were adversely impacted by floods caused by heavy rains by midday last Thursday, with three deaths and 101,000 people evacuated.
Cause_Specific	Over 600 houses were destroyed, and 36,900 hectares of farmland were flooded.
Cause_Specific	The direct economic losses were estimated at 2.4 billion yuan.
Cause_Specific	Gansu Province saw about 1.08 million people affected, with 12 deaths, four people missing and 27,000 people evacuated.
Cause_Specific	More than 1,200 houses were destroyed, and the total direct economic losses were put at 1.47 billion yuan.
Main	(Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N) said it shut down a North Carolina natural gas plant due to flooding as the deluge of water continued in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence, which has killed more than 40 people.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Duke also said it cannot rule out the possibility that coal ash from another plant is flowing into nearby waters.
Cause_Specific	Water breached the cooling lake dam at Duke’s 625-megawatt natural gas L.V.
Cause_Specific	Sutton plant, causing the company to shut the plant.
Cause_General	Water is now exiting the cooling lake through breaches, one large and several smaller, the company said in a statement on Friday.
Cause_General	However, the company later in the day issued a statement saying the situation remains stable at the plant.
Cause_General	The company did not provide any further information on the status of the incident.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Hurricane Florence brought several feet of rain to parts of North Carolina over a period of days, and the historic level of storm flooding is not expected to subside until next week.
Cause_General	Duke reported two coal ash leaks from a retired plant in Wilmington, North Carolina, following storm Florence.
Cause_General	One came from its shuttered Sutton Power Plant on Saturday and a second on Sunday, according to federal officials.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Officials had worried the water would overwhelm several pits where coal ash had been stored, potentially contaminating rivers.
Cause_General	“We have not been able to get our feet on the ground to get the water quality sampling” due to flooding in the area, Michael Regan, Secretary of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, said during North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper’s Hurricane Florence briefing on Friday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We plan to conduct flyovers and partner with the Department of Transportation to see if we can ascertain ... whether any coal ash has filtered into the Cape Fear River,” Regan said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Separately, company spokeswoman Paige Sheehan told Reuters they cannot rule out the possibility that coal ash might have entered the Cape Fear River.
Cause_General	Coal ash collects at the bottom of basins, making it difficult to determine when ash escapes from a site.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Coal ash can contaminate water and harm fish and wildlife.
Cause_General	Ash pits and other embankments have ruptured under heavy rain in the past, and Duke Energy had agreed to secure the sites in North Carolina’s lowland areas - but that work is ongoing.
Cause_General	The company’s shares closed down almost 1 percent at $79.82 on Friday.

Main	KOCHI, India (Reuters) - The death toll from the worst floods in nearly a century in the Indian tourist state of Kerala rose to 43 on Wednesday as rising water stranded tens of thousands of people and forced the closure of one of its main airports.
Cause_Specific	The five latest fatalities from the rain that began a week ago came when authorities in the southern state were forced to release water from 35 dangerously full dams, sending a surge into its main river.
Cause_General	“Presently, 35 reservoirs in the state are releasing water.
Cause_General	Many districts in the state are facing floods,” the state’s chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, said on Twitter.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Indian Meteorological Department has forecast heavy to very heavy rain in the state until Saturday, and it has issued a “red alert” for 12 out of its 14 districts.
Cause_General	The airport in the port city of Kochi will stay shut until Saturday afternoon.
Cause_General	The rain and floods have destroyed and damaged hundreds of houses in the past week and caused significant losses to crops in the state known for its spices and coffee.

Main	BHUBANESWAR/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Heavy rains flooded a hospital critical care unit in eastern India, an official said on Monday, as annual monsoon rains destroyed homes in several parts of the country and forced others to flee to higher ground.
Main	Television showed doctors wading through knee-deep water tending to patients lying on raised beds at the government Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) in Patna, the capital of Bihar state.
Cause_General	Some patients had been moved out as staff pumped out water that had seeped into medical equipment.
Cause_General	More than 1,500 people have died so far this year across the country due to storms, floods and landslides.
Distant_Evaluation	Most government action in India tends to focus on relief, with weak early warning systems and too little focus on prevention.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	More rain is forecast for Bihar and neighboring Uttar Pradesh where 80 people have died over the last four days, either drowning or being hit by collapsing walls.
Cause_General	Rivers running through Uttar Pradesh were in spate.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The next one week is critical.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If the water level rises consistently...definitely we will have a flood scenario,” said state relief commissioner Sanjay Kumar.
Cause_General	More than 10,000 people who lived near the banks of the Yamuna river in and around Delhi have been shifted to tents on higher ground as the water level crossed the danger mark, district magistrate K. Mahesh said.

Distant_Evaluation	The decision to decline foreign help drew criticism from the opposition which called for an end the suffering of the people of the southern state hit by the worst flooding in a century, which has killed hundreds of people.
Cause_Specific	Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has announced assistance of 6 billion rupees ($85 million), compared with a request from the state for at least 20 billion rupees.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Modi has promised more aid and his government said late on Wednesday that would come through “domestic efforts”.
Distant_Evaluation	“The government of India deeply appreciates offers from several countries, including from foreign governments, to assist in relief and rehabilitation efforts after the tragic floods in Kerala,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“In line with the existing policy, the government is committed to meeting the requirements for relief and rehabilitation through domestic efforts.”
Cause_Specific	This week, the United Arab Emirates offered assistance of $100 million while Qatar offered $5 million.
Cause_General	Many people from Kerala live and work in the Gulf.
Cause_Specific	Torrential rain that began in Kerala on Aug. 8 killed 231 people, destroyed tens of thousands of homes, and washed away roads and bridges, leading to an estimated loss of at least 200 billion rupees ($2.85 billion).
Cause_General	The rain eased over the weekend as the focus of efforts turned to relief and rehabilitation from rescue.
Distant_Evaluation	The main opposition Congress party accused Modi of exacerbating the crisis by failing to come through with more aid and creating obstacles to foreign help.
Distant_Evaluation	“This decision is quite disappointing to the people of Kerala,” Congress leader and former Kerala Chief Minister Oommen Chandy wrote in a public letter to Modi.
Distant_Evaluation	“Rules should be such (that they) eradicate the sufferings of the people.
Distant_Evaluation	If there exist any obstacle against the acceptance of foreign aid, kindly look into the matter seriously and bring suitable modifications.”
Cause_General	The foreign ministry said the government would welcome contributions to the Prime Minister’s Relief Fund and the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund from foundations, Indians living abroad and from people of Indian origin.
Distant_Evaluation	Kerala’s Finance Minister Thomas Isaac said on Twitter the central government should compensate the state for refusing foreign aid.

Main	BEIJING, Aug. 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Emergency Management said Thursday that three teams have been sent to provinces that could be severely affected by this year's 19th typhoon, Soulik.
Main	The teams, composed of personnels from disaster relief, fire control and work safety departments, will assist local efforts to prepare for possible disasters in the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang in northeast China, and Shandong Province in the east, the ministry said in a statement.
Cause_General	"""They will carry out inspections of local work in disaster relief and prevention, focusing on work arrangements, preventative measures, rescue teams, fund and material preparation, relocation and precautions taken by companies,"" the statement said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	China on Thursday renewed a blue alert for Typhoon Soulik, which is expected to move northeast at a speed of about 10 km per hour, and make landfall on the Korean Peninsula Thursday evening, the National Meteorological Center said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Influenced by the typhoon and cold air, northeast China regions will be hit by heavy rain from Thursday to Saturday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Coastal regions including Shandong is expected to be hit by moderate to strong gales.

Main	SALIMA, Malawi, March 17 (Xinhua) -- China has handed over projects to disaster-prone regions of Malawi to help them build resilience and reduce effects of the disasters.
Cause_General	The handover ceremony held in Kombeza area, a disaster-prone area in central Malawi's Salima district, about 93 kilometers from the capital Lilongwe, was attended by Clement Chintu Phiri, Secretary to the Vice-President and Commissioner for Disaster Management Affairs, Chinese Ambassador to Malawi Wang Shiting as well as United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Resident Coordinator Maria Jose Torres.
Cause_General	Launched in June 2016, the Disaster Risk Reduction Small Grants Scheme was supporting poor and vulnerable communities in 15 identified disaster prone districts and was a trilateral pilot project being undertaken by the Malawian government, with the technical and financial support of the Chinese government and the UNDP.
Cause_General	Among the projects are four evacuation centers, a dyke and two check dams meant to hold water.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In his remarks, the Malawian government official thanked China and the UNDP for the project, saying they will go a long way in building resilience in communities against disasters.
Distant_Evaluation	He said tackling disasters was expensive and unsustainable without the support of the cooperating partners.
Cause_General	He especially singled out the construction of evacuation centers as it will stop the tendency of taking people to facilities such as schools when there was no a disaster and that the facilities will also be used for other issues in the communities.
Distant_Evaluation	He commended the support the Malawian government has continued to receive from China, saying this has contributed to the uplifting of people's living standards.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On his part, the Chinese envoy thanked all the partners in the project and promised to continue working with authorities in coming up with projects to benefit the local people.

Main	JAKARTA, Sept 29 (Reuters) - At least 30 people were killed when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the city of Palu on Indonesia’s Sulawesi island on Friday, a hospital official told Metro TV in a report broadcast on Saturday.
Cause_General	Strong aftershocks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday morning after waves up to two metres (six feet) high swept through the scenic tourist town, triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake on land.
Cause_General	Amateur footage shown by local TV stations, which could not immediately be authenticated by Reuters, showed waters crashing into houses along Palu’s shoreline, scattering shipping containers and flooding into a mosque in the city.
Distant_Evaluation	“Bodies of victims were found in several places, because they were hit by the rubble of collapsing buildings or swept away by the tsunami ... but we are still collecting data,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman said on Saturday.
Main	Doctor Komang Adi Sujendra told Metro TV that 30 people were killed and their bodies taken to his hospital, adding another 12 injured needed orthopaedic surgery.
Cause_General	National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Nugroho declined to give an official death toll.
Cause_General	Dozens of injured people were being treated in makeshift medical tents set up outdoors, TV images showed.
Cause_General	The quake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut communications around Palu.
Distant_Evaluation	On Saturday, authorities were still having difficulties coordinating rescue efforts.
Cause_General	Chief security minister Wiranto told TVOne the military had started sending in cargo planes from the capital Jakarta carrying relief aid.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The city’s airport remained closed after its runway and air traffic control tower was damaged in the quake but officials said they were preparing to reopen to allow aid to come in.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We hope the airport can be reopened soon for flights carrying disaster relief and aid,” said Yohannes Sirait of AirNav, the air traffic management agency.
Cause_General	Metro TV played amateur footage that showed large pools of water remaining from the tsunami, a bridge that had been washed away, large cracks in roads and buildings badly damaged.
Distant_Anecdotal	Tezar Kodongan, a resident of Palu who took one of the videos, told the TV station some of the city landmarks were badly damaged.
Distant_Anecdotal	“There is no evacuation yet in the disaster area,” Kodongan added.
Distant_Evaluation	The U.S. Geological Survey put the magnitude of the second quake at a strong 7.5, after first saying it was 7.7.
Cause_General	The Palu area was hit by a less powerful quake earlier on Friday, which destroyed some houses, killed one person and injured at least 10 in the fishing town of Donggala, closest to the epicentre, authorities said.
Cause_General	More than 600,000 people live in Donggala and Palu.
Cause_General	Indonesia sits on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Cause_General	In August, a series of major quakes killed over 500 people in the tourist island of Lombok and destroyed dozens of villages along its northern coast.

Main	KATOWICE, Poland (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Taxing the extraction of fossil fuels could help pay for the growing costs of damage from harsher storms, wildfires, floods and rising seas, while providing a stronger incentive to wean the world off carbon-heavy energy, green groups said on Monday.
Main	A “climate damages tax” levied on oil, gas and coal companies could raise $300 billion a year by 2030 to bail out communities bearing the brunt of global warming, said a proposal supported by WWF, Practical Action and others.
Main	The tax would lay the cost of rising disaster losses directly on the industries most responsible for them, they said in a report released at U.N. climate negotiations in Poland.
Main	Besides assisting those in need overseas, at least half of the funds raised from the government-levied tax would help poorer groups at home switch to green jobs, energy and transport, its backers said.
Distant_Evaluation	Spending on social justice measures is seen as crucial to avoiding the kind of protests France has seen in recent weeks over rising living costs, sparked partly by hikes in fuel taxes.
Distant_Evaluation	“The injustice of climate change is that the impacts are felt first and hardest by those with the least responsibility for its causes,” said Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu’s foreign affairs minister.
Distant_Historical	His Pacific island nation lost 64 percent of its GDP - about $450 million - during Cyclone Pam in 2015, and has struggled to recover financially, he noted.
Distant_Evaluation	“We cannot sustain the level of public expenditure we need to keep recovering,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	As the pace of disasters picks up, “we’re now on a permanent state-of-emergency footing” and new sources of finance are needed to help meet costs, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	Saleemul Huq, head of the Bangladesh-based International Centre for Climate Change and Development, said that with cash to help poorer countries in short supply, fossil fuel companies that profit from driving climate change are an obvious source of additional money.
Distant_Evaluation	Right now, “the fossil fuel industry is causing this problem and getting out of paying for it”, he added.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	From 2021, the proposed tax would levy $5 on each ton of heat-trapping emissions expected to be generated by oil, coal and gas deposits that are extracted from the ground.
Main	The money would flow through existing national systems for royalty payments where fossil fuel companies operate, with a share going through a body set up under the Green Climate Fund to help pay for losses around the world, the report said.
Main	Part of the levy would stay in nations with fossil fuel industries, to help their workers find new jobs and pay for cleaner infrastructure for low-income communities, it said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Poorer fossil fuel-producing states, such as Indonesia and Nigeria, would keep all the funds raised, with middle-income nations such as China and Colombia retaining a larger share of income than richer countries, which would keep about half.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	LAWSUIT ‘TSUNAMI’
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The tax would rise by $5 a year until 2030, jumping to a $10 annual increase after that through 2050, when fossil fuels must be largely phased out of global energy systems to meet government commitments made under the 2015 Paris climate accord.
Distant_Evaluation	“The world must wean itself off fossil fuels if we are to protect the planet - and we must do so quickly,” Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, WWF’s climate and energy head and former Peruvian environment minister, said in a statement supporting the tax.
Distant_Evaluation	Julie-Anne Richards, one of the report’s authors, said the tax was “a practical way to address the injustice at the heart of climate change”.
Distant_Evaluation	The fossil fuel industry makes “hundreds of billions in profits while the true costs of their products are paid by the rest of society”, she added.
Distant_Evaluation	There are precedents for such taxes on tobacco, oil spills and the nuclear industry, she noted.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And as losses mount from wilder weather, a fossil fuel levy could become more politically palatable, particularly as companies face a rising tide of costly lawsuits over their responsibility in causing climate change.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“This tsunami of litigation that is coming down the line will make the climate damages tax look more appealing,” Richards said on the sidelines of the U.N. talks.
Distant_Historical	Storm damage in the United States and the Caribbean alone last year amounted to more than $220 billion, representing nearly two-thirds of global losses caused by natural disasters in 2017, the United Nations said last week.
Main	VIENTIANE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The reporting and sharing of fake news and photos on the dam collapse disaster in southern Laos violates the Lao laws, a national ad hoc committee in charge of dealing with the disaster warned.
Cause_Specific	"The committee issued the warning Saturday after learning that some social media users both in Laos and abroad as well as media organizations had published reports containing many ""incorrect"" statements, local state-run online newspaper Vientiane Times reported Sunday."
Cause_Specific	These fake reports had been issued since the disaster occurred on July 23, it said.
Distant_Evaluation	The committee called on everyone in Laos and other countries, media organizations and social media followers to pay attention only to accurate reports and photos published by the state-run media such as newspapers, radio and national TV, which regularly report on developments in the situation.
Cause_Specific	After the Xe-Pian Xe-Namnoy hydropower reservoir's saddle dam D burst on Monday, flash floods swamped villages in Sanamxay district, Attapeu province, some 560 km southeast of capital Vientiane.
Main	The committee warned that false reports and the sharing of fake news and photos about the flooding in Attapeu province as well as fake news and photos about weather condition and storms across the country violate Lao laws and regulations.

Main	A health ministry spokesman said as of Sunday there had been nearly 200 confirmed cases of what is locally called rat fever - the waterborne disease leptospirosis transmitted via the urine of infected animals, with symptoms including muscle pain and fever.
Cause_Specific	The surge in cases comes after torrential rain beginning on Aug. 8 flooded almost the entire state, killing hundreds of people, destroying thousands of homes and causing at least 200 billion rupees ($2.81 billion) worth of damage.
Cause_General	The health ministry began distributing preventive medicine last month and warned about the outbreak of leptospirosis and other waterborne diseases such as typhoid and cholera, Health Minister K.K.
Cause_General	Shailaja told reporters.
Main	Local media reported three leptospirosis deaths on Monday.
Distant_Evaluation	“The victims had unfortunately not taken preventive medicine,” the minister said.

Cause_General	Leptospirosis rarely spreads from person to person and can be treated with common antibiotics.
Main	“In the past week, we have seen about 30 deaths in Kozhikode and Wayanad,” said Mohammed Javeed, internal medicine specialist at a private hospital in Kerala, referring to two of the worst flood-affected districts on the state’s southwest coast.
Cause_General	Javeed said the state has leptospirosis cases every monsoon season as paddy fields fill with water, increasing the chance of infection for farmers, especially through wounds such as cuts.
Cause_General	Of particular concern, however, is that some of the victims this year did not have usual symptoms such as mild jaundice, blood in urine or bleeding spots on the skin, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“This time it is a fast, progressive infection,” Javeed told Reuters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The recent deaths indicate clearly the threat of an epidemic.”
Cause_General	Medical professionals are continuing to dispense preventive medicine in the form of tablets which need to be taken once a week for a month, Javeed said.

Distant_Anecdotal	FOUNTAIN, Fla. (Reuters) - After a fitful night of throbbing abdominal pain, curled up in a ball inside her hurricane-battered home trying to wish away the agony, 21-year-old Angelena Sawyer could barely function, let alone tend to her infant daughter.

Distant_Anecdotal	Writhing in misery, Sawyer had no idea she was suffering from acute appendicitis.
Distant_Anecdotal	Neither did her parents nor her husband, Jacob Sibilia, fully realize the gravity of the situation as they coped with the larger crisis of surviving the aftermath of a natural disaster.
Cause_General	A week already had passed since Hurricane Michael laid waste to rural Bay County, Florida, leaving Sawyer’s family, like many others, essentially stranded without electricity, phone service or running water.
Distant_Anecdotal	They had little if any gasoline, a 3-month-old to care for, and Sawyer’s stepmother, Jessica Melvin, was suffering from an infected foot injury.
Distant_Anecdotal	The turning point was a random visit that day by three disaster volunteers - Zach Smith, John Basehore and Robert Pepper - checking on residents door to door in the sparsely populated Florida Panhandle community of Fountain, northeast of Panama City.
Distant_Anecdotal	Assessing Sawyer’s condition, they realized she needed immediate medical attention.
Distant_Anecdotal	While Smith cleaned and bandaged Melvin’s foot, his colleagues called the local fire department and arranged for an ambulance to transport Sawyer to the nearest hospital some 30 miles away.
Distant_Anecdotal	Doctors who treated her later told Sawyer her appendix had nearly ruptured.
Distant_Anecdotal	The intervention of Smith, Basehore and Pepper had likely saved her life.
Cause_Specific	At least 29 deaths in Florida have been attributed to Michael, which slammed ashore on Oct. 10 as a Category 4 hurricane and the most powerful on record ever to hit the Panhandle region.
Distant_Anecdotal	“If it wasn’t for this crew and these men, I wouldn’t have made it to the hospital,” Sawyer told Reuters in a text message following her ordeal.
Distant_Anecdotal	The three men, all U.S. military veterans, were part of the volunteer group 50 Star Search and Rescue, one of dozens of such outfits formed during previous flood disasters in Texas and Louisiana and reactivated in Florida when Michael struck.
Main	Many, including 50 Star, operated under the banner of CrowdSource Rescue, a larger Houston-based network that coordinated and supported teams on the ground with thousands of volunteers working remotely around the country.
Cause_General	Specialized technology was a key to their work.
Cause_General	Their search teams relied on a digital application that enables cell phones to operate as walkie-talkie radios, as well as an Uber-like app with global positioning satellite (GPS) map to pinpoint those in distress.
Cause_General	Much of their effort was devoted to searching for people whom loved ones reported missing in the hardest hit shorefront communities of Mexico Beach, Panama City and Panama City Beach.
Cause_General	Teams also fanned out to isolated areas farther inland to deliver meals, water and medical assistance.
Distant_Anecdotal	Their mission, said Smith, 30, was to “make sure that medically everyone is safe and sound and that people have supplies and that there’s no medical emergencies.”
Cause_General	After 11 days, CrowdSource teams succeeded in locating more than 2,800 people initially unaccounted for - all found alive - and turned over about 30 unresolved cases to local authorities, the group’s co-founder, Matthew Marchetti, told Reuters.
Cause_General	The groups served some 4,500 meals to survivors during the past weekend alone, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	While reinforcing the strained resources of official search-and-rescue teams, the volunteers worked largely independently of them, Marchetti said.

Distant_Anecdotal	NAIROBI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When heavy rains hit Kenya’s capital in March, Penina Mueni’s three sewing machines went underwater.
Distant_Anecdotal	The tailor, who repairs clothes in southern Nairobi’s Makuru kwa Reuben slum, hadn’t had problems with flooding earlier.
Distant_Anecdotal	But as climate change brings more intense rains, it is threatening her business.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Right now I don’t know how I will get money to repair the machines.
Distant_Anecdotal	My garment materials are completely spoiled.
Distant_Anecdotal	It’s a huge loss I have never (before) incurred in my life,” said Mueni, 40, pointing to the sodden mess that was her shop.
Cause_General	Wilder weather is bringing flooding and other threats to many of Africa’s cities, with Nairobi, Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Somalia’s capital Mogadishu all experiencing flooding this spring.
Distant_Evaluation	But poor urban planning is as much a risk as climate change, said Juliette Biao Koudenoukpo, the regional director of the U.N.
Distant_Evaluation	Environment Programme (UNEP).
Distant_Evaluation	“Increasing population and poor urban planning is a problem.
Distant_Evaluation	If we only had well-planned cities we wouldn’t experience problems like this,” she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Cause_General	UNEP estimates that worsening flooding is costing sub-Saharan Africa 1.4 percent of its GDP each year, with the costs of adapting to the changes running at 3 percent of GDP.
Distant_Historical	Venant Ndighila, an emergency response manager for Kenya’s Red Cross, said that flash flooding in March this year took a heavy toll on roads and other infrastructure.
Distant_Historical	“Due to early prediction by the Kenya Meteorological Department, we had planned for these floods,” he said.
Distant_Historical	But this year floods reached areas where they had not before, including in 13 of 25 Kenyan counties, he said.
Distant_Historical	The floods left roads and bridges submerged in some areas and schools flooded, as well as covering at least 8,450 acres of farmland and killing more than 6,000 livestock, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
Distant_Evaluation	Robert Masese, director of secondary and tertiary education for the Ministry of Education, said in April that more money needed to be invested in disaster preparedness.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“It has been estimated that a dollar invested in disaster risk reduction can save two to 10 dollars in disaster response and recovery cost,” he said.
Distant_Historical	To deal with the worsening flood threat, Nairobi County in March set aside 194 million Kenyan shillings ($1.9 million) to improve drainage and deal with worsening flooding problems, said Mohamed Dagane, roads and infrastructure executive for the county.
Main	He told reporters the county government has come up with a plan to address flash flooding threats, in part through measures such as mapping flood-prone areas and improving response time to clear blocked drains in those areas.
Main	Kenya’s National Environmental Management Authority also said in a press statement it had begun closing businesses that had encroached on the Nairobi River, which runs through the city.
Main	Government cabinet officials also last month approved a National Disaster Risk Management policy that aims to boost investment in disaster research and efforts to reduce Kenya’s vulnerability to hazards, including droughts and flooding.

Main	BEIJING, July 19 (Xinhua) -- President Xi Jinping has stressed a people-centered approach to flood control and disaster relief work and urged all-out efforts to ensure the safety of people's lives and property.
Main	Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remark in an instruction on flood control and disaster relief work as rainstorms have hit many regions across the country, triggering landslides and flooding of rivers since July.
Main	Noting that China has entered flood and typhoon season, Xi urged Party committees and governments of related regions to firmly adhere to a people-centered approach, carry out rescue and relief work at full strength, minimize casualties, properly arrange people's lives in disaster areas and reduce disaster losses to the minimum.
Cause_General	Since July this year, rainstorms have hit many regions, triggering flooding of rivers, including the Yangtze, Yellow, Jialing, Tuojiang, and Fujiang rivers.
Cause_Specific	As of July 18, a total of 20.53 million people in 27 provincial-level regions had been affected by flooding with 54 dead and eight missing.
Cause_Specific	Flood disasters also affected 1.759 million hectares of crops and flattened 23,000 houses, inflicting direct economic losses of 51.6 billion yuan (7.6 billion U.S. dollars).
Cause_General	Xi ordered local authorities of relevant regions to strengthen emergency duties, fulfill responsibilities, and refine planned measures to ensure disasters can be addressed quickly.
Main	Monitoring and early warnings of meteorological, flooding, and geological disasters should be enhanced and inspections of major areas should be strengthened to prevent disasters and secondary disasters, Xi said.
Main	The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, Ministry of Natural Resources, and Ministry of Emergency Management should coordinate all social forces and resources, and guide local governments to carry out relief work and make all-out efforts to ensure the safety of people's lives and property and social stability, Xi said.
Cause_General	Flood-hit regions have launched emergency responses and taken all efforts to relocate people and repair facilities.
Cause_General	The State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, Ministry of Natural Resources, and Ministry of Emergency Management have dispatched work teams to flood-hit areas to lead relief work.

Error	(Xinhua/Ma Ping)
Main	TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The death toll continued to rise while government stepped up search and rescue efforts after torrential rain pummeled western Japan, causing flooding and landslides.
Main	According to Japan's public broadcaster NHK, 158 people have been confirmed dead in 12 prefectures and 56 people are still unaccounted for.
Cause_Specific	Hiroshima prefecture was hit hardest by the record rainfall and subsequent landslides, with death toll there reaching 59, while Okayama prefecture suffered 54 deaths.
Main	The government and local municipalities have stepped up search and rescue efforts to find the 56 people that are still unaccounted for, and as most of the people missing are in Hiroshima, death toll could further rise in the prefecture.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, more than 10,000 people in 15 prefectures were still staying under evacuation shelters as of Tuesday noon, with blazing heat now compounding the problem.
Cause_Specific	According to the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), an active seasonal rain front caused torrential rain in most eastern and western regions of Japan since last Thursday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The agency has warned that Japan's Kinki region, which includes Kyoto, Hyogo and Osaka prefectures, could be particularly hard-hit by downpours, escalating the risk of floods, landslides, lightning and tornadoes.
Distant_Evaluation	Regarding the heavy casualty, Emi Masatani, an expert from Japan Bousaisikai, a non-profit disaster-prevention organization, told Xinhua that people in Japan normally attach great importance to prevention of natural disasters, but sometimes fail to pay enough attention to heavy rainfalls as they are predictable.
Cause_Specific	According to local reports, many people chose to stay at home even after the weather agency issued emergency warnings and evacuation orders following the heavy rain and thus lost the chance to escape when flooding or landslides occurred.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe who canceled his trip to Europe and the Middle East to attend to the disaster, told a meeting of the government's crisis response unit that reserve funds would be made available before requests came in from local governments.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We will assess the needs of victims and push for quick reconstruction,"" the prime minister said."
Cause_General	Abe is scheduled to visit Okayama prefecture on Wednesday to inspect the damage and assess the evacuees' needs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Japan's top government spokesperson Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a press briefing that the government is likely to tap into reserve funds of about 2 billion yen (18 million U.S. dollars) to help deal with the disaster's aftereffects.
Cause_General	But Farm Minister Ken Saito said that damage caused to agriculture, including mountain forests, paddy fields and reservoirs, had already topped 7 billion yen (63 million U.S. dollars).
Cause_General	The Fire and Disaster Management Agency said that as of Tuesday morning, 347 homes have been partially or completely destroyed by the downpours or in landslides and 9,868 homes have been flooded.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The extent of the damage is likely to rise significantly, the agency said, as many municipalities have yet to report the full extent of the damage.
Cause_General	Abe also said that to address food and water shortages in some of the disaster areas, trucks carrying food and water stocks to retail stores, including convenience stores, will be considered emergency vehicles.
Cause_General	The Health Ministry said that as of Tuesday morning, nearly 300,000 homes spanning 12 prefectures in western Japan were still without water supply.
Cause_General	To safeguard their workers, some major businesses in the disaster-hit regions have halted production, including at Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp.

Main	HOUSTON, Sept. 14 (Xinhua) -- Governor of U.S. state of Texas on Friday issued a State Disaster Declaration for 78 counties impacted by severe weather and flooding as a tropical storm approaches the state.
Distant_Evaluation	"Governor Greg Abbott said, ""While we stand ready to deploy state resources to assist local officials in their response efforts, it is critical that all Texans in the storm's path are prepared to ensure their own safety."""
Cause_General	Prior to the disaster declaration, the governor has ordered the Texas State Operations Center to increase its readiness level in response to the storm.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Heavy rainfall, floods and gusty winds are expected across portions of Texas on Friday and Saturday due to an atmospheric event in the Gulf of Mexico.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, Hurricane Florence is smashing U.S. East Coast with strong winds and storm surges on the coasts of North Carolina and South Carolina.
Distant_Historical	One year ago, Hurricane Harvey made landfall on Aug. 25 at a Mexico Gulf coastal town in southeastern Texas as a Category 4 hurricane.
Distant_Historical	As the most powerful tropical storm to have hit Texas in more than 50 years, it dropped heavy rain and caused record catastrophic flooding in Houston and the surrounding region.
Distant_Historical	In Harris County of the Greater Houston region, 51.89 inches (131.8 cm) of rain -- the highest storm total in U.S. history -- was recorded over the six-day period through Aug. 30, 2017.
Distant_Evaluation	Ray Baldwin has had it.
Cause_General	The first selectman of Trumbull, he has seen the Pequonnock River flood dozens of homes and downtown three times in the last year -- most recently in the April 15 northeaster.
Distant_Evaluation	''Enough's enough -- we've got to give these people some relief,'' Mr. Baldwin said last week.
Distant_Evaluation	''We have to have some plan.
Distant_Evaluation	You just can't sit around on your hands waiting for somebody else to act.''
Main	So even before the floodwaters receded, Mr. Baldwin dusted off and began revising an old proposal to build a retention dam across the Pequonnock where one existed in the first half of the 20th century.
Main	Other public officials around the state are showing similar determination, with a number of communities hit hard by the storm resurrecting old projects with renewed vigor.
Main	And in places where flood mitigation work was done, officials are using the storm as a test to determine whether they need to reassess.
Distant_Evaluation	In East Haven, notorious for its coastal and river flooding, officials said that recent projects had left roads more passable than in past storms, though residents of one beach area complained that their homes were as flooded as ever.
Distant_Evaluation	Others said the storm provided an incentive to go ahead with a project to raise several houses.
Distant_Evaluation	In low-lying Danbury, Mayor Mark D. Boughton said drainage projects over the years had held the water better than in the past, but an area near Lake Kenosia flooded as badly this time as it did in 1999, when remnants of Hurricane Floyd produced the city's worst flooding in decades.
Cause_General	The mayor said he sent a letter last month to the Army Corps of Engineers asking for action.
Cause_General	He was not the only one.
Cause_General	The regional planning office of the corps in Concord, Mass., reported a number of calls from communities and individuals in Connecticut looking for assistance.
Cause_General	The Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection also fielded similar calls, and Denise Ruzicka, the department's director of inland water resources, said the agency had programs designed to help communities navigate the tangle of federal and state programs that offer financial services and technical help for flood mitigation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''We're a touch point, and you can bet we'll be doing a lot more of that this year,'' she said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But public works directors say flood projects can take years to wind through the various bureaucracies, a point not lost on the town of Woodbury, where permits and money for restoring the bank along a section of the Pomperaug River had languished for more than seven years.
Cause_General	After some 40 feet of bank collapsed in last month's storm, threatening at least one home, approvals arrived within days.
Cause_General	Work began a week later.
Cause_Specific	One reason communities now see the need to revisit their flood plans is that population growth and intense development have changed how the landscape handles water.
Cause_Specific	A recent analysis by the University of Connecticut's Center for Land Use Education and Research showed that from 1985 to 2002, the percentage of the state's surface that is impervious increased by 22 percent, much of it in coastal areas.
Distant_Evaluation	That means more runoff and more flooding -- something Westport is all too familiar with.
Cause_General	The town completed millions of dollars in flood mitigation work in the last 10 years, after a 1992 storm inundated it and a number of coastal communities.
Cause_General	But there was still substantial flooding last month around beaches, the Saugatuck River and the many brooks and streams that flow through town.
Distant_Evaluation	Westport officials attribute much of the flooding to a development spurt in the years after the town's most recent study of flood areas and drainage, done in the 1970s.
Main	Within days of the recent floods, town officials requested that the Flood and Erosion Control Board authorize a new study to determine how to redirect priorities.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's close to 30 years,'' said the town's public works director, Stephen J. Edwards.
Distant_Evaluation	''Some development patterns have challenged our projects.''
Distant_Evaluation	Equally important, Mr. Edwards said, is the town's obligation to re-educate residents about how they can provide their own flood protection and their need to be responsible for private property and private roadways.
Distant_Evaluation	''There's definitely a renewed awareness of our vulnerability, of our susceptibility to these types of events,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''Nothing makes it easier to sell a project than a catastrophe.''
Distant_Evaluation	Which is what Ray Baldwin in Trumbull is counting on.
Distant_Historical	Earlier efforts to rebuild the dam stalled when residents objected to the large body of water it would have created.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	His new plan calls for a retention dam that would regulate water flow rather than stop it.
Distant_Evaluation	Henry R. DiJulio Jr., who lives on a tributary of the Pequonnock, said the degree of flooding Trumbull experienced last month hadn't happened in 35 years.
Cause_General	Recently, he gave Mr. Baldwin a tour of his basement and showed him the damage from three feet of water.
Distant_Evaluation	''Ray, you've got to do something,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''I'm working on it,'' Mr. Baldwin said.

Distant_Evaluation	“People were told not to work or sleep in basements.
Distant_Evaluation	They used to move buses to higher ground.
Distant_Evaluation	All these contingency plans had to be in place,” remembers Steve East, an engineering manager for the British Environment Agency.
Distant_Evaluation	But since 1982, when the Thames Barrier - London’s pioneering flood protection wall - came into use, central Londoners have scarcely had to think about flood risks.
Distant_Evaluation	“Today if London is threatened by a tidal surge, we stop the surge here and London carries on with its normal day-to-day business,” said East, the engineering manager for the barrier, which spans the Thames in Woolwich in southeast London.
Cause_General	As climate change brings more extreme rainfall, higher tides and stronger storms, flood risks are rising across Britain - and flood protection barriers are rising as well.
Main	Ipswich in eastern England will put into operation its first tidal barrier this winter, part of a 66-million-pound ($86-million) flood protection system designed to defend the town against growing threats, officials there say.
Distant_Evaluation	Other British towns, including the east coast port of Boston, are planning barriers of their own, said Andrew Usborne, the project manager for the Ipswich barrier, on the River Orwell.
Distant_Evaluation	The moveable barriers - which retract into the riverbed floor when not in use and are raised only when needed - are being built not just because of rising risks but because they increasingly make financial sense, Usborne said.
Distant_Evaluation	In Ipswich, “this was the cheapest and preferred option,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	Walls built along the waterfront, long used to protect the city, now need to be raised to meet growing risks “but nobody’s ever going to accept a meter of wall all through the center of town”, he said.
Cause_General	The new barrier, which sits on piles driven 60m (66 yards) into the chalky soil, will protect about 1,200 homes and more than 400 businesses from the kind of storm expected to hit every 300 years, he said - and rising climate change risks have been taken into account.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Across Britain, “where it is financially and technically appropriate, like here, we will have barriers,” he predicted.
Cause_General	London’s Thames Barrier - a 520m span of steel gates, piers and abutments that looks as if it might have been inspired by the Sydney Opera House - has now been used more than 180 times to protect central London from tidal floods, East said.
Distant_Evaluation	The rate of use has been increasing - at one point, it was closed on 24 consecutive tides - but that increasing crescendo of closures “was always expected,” the engineer said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The structure was designed to last until 2030 - but assessments suggest it will now last until 2070, when a new barrier will need to be put in place, he said.
Error	Slideshow (4 Images)
Distant_Evaluation	For now, however, the barrier remains an effective bulwark, keeping 1.25 million Londoners - and 300 billion pounds worth of infrastructure - above the rising tide, officials say.
Distant_Historical	“Until the 1920s, people actually died in floods in central London - and the real catalyst for the Thames Barrier and the rest of the tidal defense system was the floods of 1953, where over 350 people died,” East said.
Distant_Historical	“That was a wake-up call to the government that they had to come up with a solution,” he said.
Distant_Anecdotal	HOUSTON (Reuters) - In an empty lot where Vincent Shields’ Houston home once stood, he points out properties whose owners were driven out after Hurricane Harvey inundated the region last summer.
Distant_Anecdotal	“On this street there’s probably less than 30 percent occupancy,” said Shields, who tore down his house after the city ruled damage exceeded half its value and it would have to be elevated before being repaired.
Distant_Anecdotal	He and his wife moved into an apartment and began planning a new, higher home at the same location.
Cause_General	It has been roughly nine months since Hurricane Harvey dumped trillions of gallons of water on the U.S. Gulf Coast, killing 68 people and causing an estimated $125 billion in property damage.
Main	Shields and some 25,000 Texas households are still displaced, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
Distant_Historical	Nearly 80,000 homes across Texas had 18 inches of floodwater or more during Harvey.
Cause_General	In Houston, data on people still out of their homes and awaiting repairs are not available from the city.
Distant_Historical	But U.S.
Distant_Historical	Postal Service figures show 11,500 Houston homes became vacant between June 2017 and February 2018.
Main	With the 2018 hurricane season beginning June 1, around 400 Houston households are still living in hotel rooms funded by FEMA, according to the agency’s latest data.
Main	Many others remain in temporary housing uncertain about their return home.
Distant_Evaluation	According to interviews with residents and neighborhood groups, many owners of flooded homes are still enmeshed in the emotionally fraught and expensive process of deciding whether to repair or elevate, or put their property up for sale.
Distant_Anecdotal	Shields said the months since Harvey have been tough and fears that another major storm before the region fully recovers would be devastating.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I can survive this once - health, wealth, physically - but I can’t do it again,” he said.
Cause_Specific	After three floods since 2014, local officials have added home-building restrictions and rules on rebuilding in flood-prone areas, giving owners of damaged homes costly new factors to consider.
Cause_Specific	Houston officials this year passed an ordinance requiring certain dwellings to be raised to the 500-year floodplain level plus two feet.
Distant_Historical	Previously, only new homes had to start one foot above the 100-year level.
Cause_General	JACKED UP HOMES
Cause_General	The requirements have forced some owners to jack up existing homes to avoid the next flood.
Cause_General	Houston homes, typically built on slab foundations, can be mechanically raised for an average cost of $100,000 to $300,000 in a months-long project, said Wayne Fairley, a managing director at house elevating company Planet Three Elevation.
Cause_General	Fairley has tripled his workforce since Harvey to meet growing demand, he said.
Cause_General	Subcontractors who once handled plumbing and electrical projects for the company now work for him full time.
Distant_Evaluation	“There were a lot of contracts signed post-Harvey,” said Fairley.
Cause_General	About 5 to 10 percent of his clients are elevating their homes preemptively, and a large portion of his work is in Houston’s Meyerland neighborhood, which was hit by three major floods in recent years.

Distant_Anecdotal	The new house will be six feet higher than the old one, which got two feet of water during Harvey.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I’m almost positive it will flood again,” said Wilson, a therapist, who hopes to move back by early next year.

Distant_Anecdotal	“Six feet might not be high enough.”
Cause_General	STILL IN LIMBO
Distant_Anecdotal	Gwen McGlory moved to west Houston’s Cinco Ranch neighborhood a decade ago for its good schools and gated subdivisions.
Distant_Anecdotal	Her house flooded after the city released water from a nearby reservoir to relieve stress on a dam, forcing her to find temporary housing.
Distant_Anecdotal	Now, most mornings she drops her 14-year-old daughter off long before school has opened and picks her up hours after it has closed because the school system lacks funding to provide transportation from her current location.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It’s concerning when I’m dropping her off at a dark school,” McGlory said, who is worried the transportation issues will continue into the next school year.
Distant_Anecdotal	McGlory says she received $33,000 from FEMA after Harvey.
Distant_Anecdotal	Of that, $17,000 was earmarked for home repairs, despite bids from contractors pegging her damages closer to $70,000.
Cause_General	The Red Cross worker recently was accepted to a rebuild and repair program run by a community group.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I’m so overwhelmed.
Distant_Anecdotal	I am working and a single parent with two kids.
Distant_Anecdotal	I’ve never rebuilt a house before,” said McGlory, who had no flood insurance because her house was not in a floodplain.
Distant_Anecdotal	While McGlory considered selling her property, an investor shortly after the storm offered $100,000 less than what she had paid for it.
Distant_Evaluation	Historically, home values in hard-hit areas can fall between 7 and 20 percent immediately after a flood, said Ed Wolff, president of real estate firm Beth Wolff Realtors and governmental affairs chair for the Houston Association of Realtors.
Distant_Evaluation	“You see a rebound after 18 to 24 months.
Distant_Evaluation	As we get further away from the event the memories fade,” said Wolff, who decided to elevate his Meyerland home by almost six feet after Harvey and returned in early May.
Cause_General	The devastation of Harvey has pushed local officials and agencies to expand efforts to mitigate the impact of floods.
Distant_Historical	Last year, county officials authorized $20 million to buy out homes that have routinely flooded.
Cause_General	The Harris County Flood Control District, which established its own buyout program in 1985, recently submitted a grant for state funding to buy homes damaged by Harvey.
Cause_General	It has also focused on repairs to drainage infrastructure and removing debris from Harvey that could block waterways before the next hurricane.
Distant_Evaluation	Officials across the nation are becoming more aware of the dangers of urban flooding, which is aggravated by unbridled development, said Sam Brody, a professor in the Department of Marine Sciences and flooding expert at Texas A&M University in Galveston.
Distant_Evaluation	“Harvey exposed these underlying problems that cities such as Houston, Miami and Chicago face,” he said.

Main	MOGADISHU, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Somalia President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed has appealed to the international community to support efforts to help 500,000 people affected by the floods that has displaced close to 175,000 from their homes.
Distant_Evaluation	Mohamed who visited Somalia's central region of HirShabelle to assess the impact of flooding on Monday said his government was taking action to address the humanitarian crisis caused by the floods.
Cause_General	"""We have formed a national disaster committee to respond to the needs of our fellow citizens who have been affected,"" he said in a statement issued on Tuesday evening."
Distant_Evaluation	Mohamed who led a high-level delegation, which included representatives from the UN and the AU Mission in Somalia to the city of BeletWeyne, said his government stands by residents affected by the floods morally and materially to deliver all the help that it can.
Cause_Specific	The humanitarian crisis was caused by the Shabelle River, which begins in the Ethiopian highlands and flows through BeletWeyne and the HirShabelle state capital of Jowhar, burst its banks following the onset of heavy rains which began last month.
Cause_Specific	According to the government, other states affected by the heavy rains include Jubbaland and South West state.
Cause_Specific	The heavy rains and flash floods come only months after a devastating drought left over 6 million people in need of humanitarian assistance last year.
Distant_Evaluation	Yngvil Foss, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) deputy country director for Somalia rainfall in recent weeks, has been heavier than anticipated.
Cause_General	"""Initially, all humanitarian actors started responding with the means and assets they had available."
Cause_General	"In the past week we have been able to raise additional money to target assistance for food, water, sanitation and non-food items to be able to respond,"" Foss said."
Distant_Evaluation	The UN has warned that the heavy rains were worsening conditions in overcrowded Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) settlements and displacing more people along riverine areas due to flooding.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The settlements have limited access to hygiene facilities, thus heightening the risk of communicable diseases.
Cause_General	According to the OCHA report, some 246,000 people are at risk of flash floods in Baidoa, Southwest region, while in Jubbaland approximately 28,200 people have been displaced by floods, which swept away home, shelters, farms and livestock.
Cause_General	In Belet Weyne, more than 200,000 people are at risk of being affected by floods after River Shabelle burst its banks, forcing many to flee the town to higher grounds.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, a team comprising AU troops and Somali national security forces has evacuated more than 10,000 people marooned by the raging floods in Belet Weyne, HirShabelle state.
Cause_General	"""We are taking part in the evacuation of Somali people so as to rescue them from flooded areas and take them to a place near Eel Jaale far from floods,"" said Col Abdourahman Rayale Hareed, the Commander of Djibouti's Hiil 5 Battalion who led the rescue mission."
Main	SEMBALUN, Indonesia (Reuters) - A powerful 6.4 magnitude earthquake struck the popular tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia on Sunday killing 14 people and sending villagers fleeing from their beds into open fields to avoid collapsing buildings.
Main_Consequence	The quake, which rocked the island early in the morning when many people were still asleep, injured 162 people and damaged thousands of houses.
Main_Consequence	Electricity was cut off in the worst-hit area, Sembalun, a sparsely populated area of rice paddies and the slopes of Mount Rinjani on the northern side of the island.
Main_Consequence	A 30-year-old Malaysian woman visiting Mount Rinjani, a popular trekking destination, was among those killed, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the disaster mitigation agency spokesman.
Cause_General	He said the area was temporarily closed to climbers because there were reports of landslides.
Cause_General	Hundreds of climbers are being evacuated from the Rinjani national park and 115 have been safely escorted out, Nugroho said.
Distant_Evaluation	“The most pressing needs now are medical personnel, stretchers, health equipment, kids wares and food,” Nugroho said.
Cause_General	An emergency tent was set up on a street in Sembalun to treat the injured because the local hospital was damaged, and those in a critical condition were taken to other hospitals.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It happened so suddenly at around 6 in the morning.
Distant_Anecdotal	Suddenly everything simply collapsed,” said Siti Sumarni, a Sembalun resident.

Distant_Anecdotal	There were waves in the pools but only for 20 to 30 seconds,” he told Reuters by telephone.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A magnitude 6.4 earthquake is considered strong and is capable of causing severe damage.
Cause_General	The Lombok quake struck at 6:47 a.m. (2247 GMT on Saturday) and was only 4.35 miles deep (7 km), a shallow depth that would have amplified its effect.
Cause_General	It was centered 50 km (31 miles) northeast of the city of Mataram, according to the U.S. Geological Survey, but it was also felt strongly to the west on the neighboring island of Bali, Indonesia’s top tourist destination.
Cause_General	Over a hundred of subsequent tremors were recorded, with the largest aftershock recorded at 5.7 magnitude, Indonesia’s Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysics Agency said.

Main	"WASHINGTON, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- Florence has rapidly strengthened into a major hurricane as it's approaching the southeastern U.S. coast,"" the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Monday."
Cause_Specific	The center of Florence was located about 2,000 kilometers east-southeast of Cape Fear, state of North Carolina, packing maximum sustained winds of 185 km per hour (kph), moving west at 20 kph, according to the latest advisory published by the weather forecaster.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On the forecast track, the center of Florence will move over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean between Bermuda and the Bahamas Tuesday and Wednesday before approaching the coast of South Caroline or North Caroline on Thursday, said the NHC.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Florence, a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, is expected to further intensify and remain an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday, it added.
Main_Consequence	The governors of South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia have declared states of emergency.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Now is the time for your family also to prepare and stay tuned for more updates,"" South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Plan for the worst, pray for the best."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"South Carolina emergency management officials said they were ""preparing for the possibility of a large-scale disaster."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	About 750 National Guard members were expected on duty in the state.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The U.S. Navy said all ships in Virginia's coastal Hampton Roads area were preparing to leave port for open seas Monday, according to reports.
Cause_General	Heavy rain in the Washington D.C. area over the weekend has already led to flooding in historic Alexandria, Virginia, local media reported, and the U.S. National Weather Service issued a flood watch for part of the Potomac River.
Cause_General	Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are considered major hurricanes because of their potential in causing a significant loss of life and damage.
Cause_General	Florence, the first major hurricane of the Atlantic season, was once a Category 4 hurricane last week, packing maximum sustained winds of 215 kph, before weakening gradually to a tropical storm, which regained hurricane strength Sunday morning.
Distant_Evaluation	Officials said the largest threat to life from hurricanes is not the high winds, noting that flooding is the deadliest result of these storms.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Current forecast models indicate that Florence could strike the Carolinas and enter central Virginia, possibly stalling and dropping more than 20 inches of rain in some areas.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That will lead to widespread and dangerous flooding, inundation of roads and damaged infrastructure.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Potential widespread power outages are also expected.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The U.S. National Guard urged local residents and visitors to prepare for rising waters, flash flooding.
Cause_General	Florence is one of three hurricanes churning in the Atlantic Ocean, along with Helene and Isaac.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While Helene is forecast to spin to sea away from land, Isaac is a real threat to the Caribbean later this week, according to the NHC.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In addition, in the Pacific Ocean, what's now Hurricane Olivia is forecast to approach Hawaii as a tropical storm on Tuesday.
Main	WILMINGTON/WILSON, N.C. (Reuters) - Deadly storm Florence drenched North Carolina with more downpours on Sunday, cutting off the coastal city of Wilmington, damaging tens of thousands of homes and threatening worse flooding as rivers fill to the bursting point.
Main_Consequence	The death toll rose to at least 17.
Cause_General	Florence, a onetime hurricane that weakened to a tropical depression by Sunday, dumped up to 40 inches (100 cm) of rain on parts of North Carolina since Thursday, and continued to produce widespread heavy rain over much of North Carolina and eastern South Carolina, the National Weather Service said.
Distant_Evaluation	“The storm has never been more dangerous than it is right now,” North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Many rivers “are still rising, and are not expected to crest until later today or tomorrow.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some rivers were not expected to crest until Monday or Tuesday, the National Weather Service said.
Cause_General	More than 900 people were rescued from rising floodwaters and 15,000 remained in shelters in the state, Cooper said.
Cause_General	Many of those rescues took place on swift boats in Wilmington, a historic coastal city of about 117,000 people on a peninsula between the Cape Fear River and the Atlantic Ocean.
Cause_General	Rescue crews negotiated downed trees and power lines to reach stranded residents, Mayor Bill Saffo told WHQR radio.
Distant_Evaluation	“There are no roads ... that are leading into Wilmington that are passable because of the flooding that is taking place now inland,” Saffo said.
Main_Consequence	The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the area until at least Monday morning and said up to 8 inches (20 cm) more rain could fall in some areas, creating an elevated risk for landslides in Western North Carolina.
Distant_Evaluation	Officials urged those who had evacuated to stay away.
Distant_Evaluation	“Our roads are flooded, there is no access into Wilmington,” New Hanover County Commission Chairman Woody White told a news conference.
Distant_Evaluation	“We want you home, but you can’t come yet.”

Distant_Evaluation	In Leland, a low-lying city north of Wilmington, homes and businesses were engulfed by water that rose up to 10 feet (3 meters) over Highway 17, submerging stop signs in what local people called unprecedented flooding.
Cause_General	The sheriff’s department and volunteers, including locals and some who came from Texas, rescued stranded residents by boat, extracting families, infants, the elderly and pets.
Cause_General	Gas stations were abandoned and fallen trees made many roads impassable.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The whir of generators could be heard throughout the city, a sound not expected to dim soon as crews work to restore power.
Distant_Anecdotal	In New Bern, a riverfront city near North Carolina’s coast, Bryan Moore and his nephew Logan did exactly what authorities warned against: they left their homes to go swimming in the floodwaters after having spent days at home without electricity or running water.
Distant_Anecdotal	“We were stir-crazy from being inside so long,” Moore said.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Feels great.
Distant_Anecdotal	The water’s really cool.
Distant_Anecdotal	... We’re just having a good old time out here, enjoying the weather.”
Cause_General	More than 641,000 homes and businesses were without electricity in North and South Carolina and surrounding states, down from a peak of nearly 1 million.
Main_Consequence	Florence set a record in the state for rain from a hurricane, surpassing the previous record of 24 inches (61 cm) set by Hurricane Floyd, which killed 56 people in 1999, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist with private forecasting service DTN Marine Weather.

Main_Consequence	The storm killed at least 11 people in North Carolina, including a mother and child killed by a falling tree, state officials said.
Main_Consequence	Six people died in South Carolina, including four in car accidents and two from carbon monoxide from a portable generator.
Distant_Evaluation	South Carolina’s governor urged anyone in a flood-prone area to evacuate.

Cause_General	Many of the state’s environmental codes were written to withstand a 25- or 100-year storm.
Cause_Specific	But Florence promises heavy rains that some regions might not see in a thousand years, straining systems meant to keep state residents safe.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The deluge could push industrial waste sites to the limit, Governor Roy Cooper said on Friday.
Distant_Evaluation	“All of the infrastructure here is going to be tested,” Cooper told a news conference.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are deeply concerned about the inland flooding.”
Distant_Evaluation	Florence would not be the first test of North Carolina manure pits, or “lagoons.”
Distant_Historical	Sixteen lagoons flooded under the foot of rain that came with Hurricane Matthew in 2016.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The southeast part of the state is expected to get more than twice that amount in the days ahead, said Bryce Link, a meteorologist at DTN Marine Weather, a forecasting service.
Cause_General	There are 62 industrial hog farms within North Carolina’s 100-year floodplain, environmentalists estimate, and Duke Energy Corp has four coal ash sites in the coastal area touched by Florence.
Main	If excrement escapes from the lagoons where it is stored, it could potentially contaminate drinking water with bacteria like salmonella, which can cause digestive problems, and, in certain vulnerable patients cause E. coli.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is working with storm-struck states and is ready to respond to any breaches, a spokeswoman, Maggie Sauerhage, said.
Cause_General	Animal feeding operations above a certain size need to be “designed and operated to handle the rainfall and runoff from 25-year 24-hour storms,” Sauerhage said in an emailed response to questions from Reuters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Even in the midst of a storm, these feeding sites must report leaks, she said.
Cause_General	In North Carolina, hog and poultry waste pits make up 6,848 acres of land according to a report from the Environmental Working Group.
Cause_General	Still, North Carolina has fewer flood-prone hog farms than it did when Hurricane Floyd inundated about 50 sites in 1999 and sparked statewide reforms.
Cause_General	Ash pits and other embankments have ruptured under heavy rain in the past, and Duke Energy has agreed to secure the sites in North Carolina’s lowland areas - but that work is ongoing.
Distant_Evaluation	Erin Culbert, a spokeswoman for Duke Energy, said the utility was ready to respond as needed to the storm.
Distant_Evaluation	There is, however, disagreement over the risk posed by Florence.
Distant_Evaluation	Andy Curliss, head of the North Carolina Pork Council, said spill dangers are overblown, noting that hog farmers have faced severe weather before.
Distant_Evaluation	“This is not the first hurricane to hit North Carolina,” said Curliss, who noted that many lagoons are at a low point across the state at this time of year.
Distant_Evaluation	But a state lawmaker said that hurricanes have led to dangerous spills in recent years and North Carolina’s laws are too lax to confront severe storms such as Florence.
Distant_Evaluation	“As a state, we have put our head in the sand,” Representative Pricey Harrison said.
Distant_Evaluation	“Past storms should have been a wakeup call.”

Cause_General	The Department of Emergency Management continues to operate eight storm shelters at various locations around Oahu which is home to the state capital Honolulu in coordination with the American Red Cross.
Cause_Specific	The center of Tropical Storm Olivia made landfall this morning with fierce winds and torrential rain near Kahakuloa on the windward coast of the island of Maui and made a second landfall on the northeast coast of Lanai later, according to NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center.
Cause_General	Local officials say the storm caused power outages and road closures in some areas.
Main	TOKYO (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake rocked northern Japan early on Tuesday, briefly disrupting cooling functions at a nuclear plant and generating a small tsunami that hit the same Fukushima region devastated by a 2011 quake, tsunami and nuclear disaster.
Main_Consequence	The magnitude 7.4 earthquake, which was felt in Tokyo, sent thousands of residents fleeing for higher ground as dawn broke along the northeastern coast.
Cause_General	There were no reports of deaths or serious injuries hours after the quake hit at 5:59 a.m. (2059 GMT Monday).
Cause_General	It was centered off the coast of Fukushima prefecture at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles), the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) said.
Main_Consequence	A wave of up to 1.4 meters (4.5 ft) high was recorded at Sendai, about 70 km (45 miles) north of Fukushima, with smaller waves hitting ports elsewhere along the coast, public broadcaster NHK said.
Cause_General	Television footage showed ships moving out to sea from harbors as tsunami warnings wailed after alerts of waves of up to 3 meters (10 feet) were issued.
Distant_Anecdotal	“We saw high waves but nothing that went over the tidal barriers,” a man in the city of Iwaki told NTV television network.

Main	"WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Last year will be remembered as the ""costliest"" one for the United States with losses from hurricanes, fires and freezes reaching a record 306 billion U.S. dollars, a U.S. government report said Monday."
Cause_Specific	The United States had 16 weather and climate disasters in 2017 each with losses exceeding one billion dollars, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said in its report.
Cause_General	That ties 2011 for the record number of billion-dollar disasters for an entire calendar year, but the total cost shatters the previous U.S. annual record of 214.8 billion dollars in 2005, the agency said.
Cause_General	At least 362 people died and many more were injured during the course of the disasters that included one drought event, two flooding events, one freeze event, eight severe storm events, three tropical cyclone events, and one wildfire event, it said.
Cause_Specific	Among the disasters are the western U.S. wildfires that caused damages tallying 18 billion dollars, which was triple the previous U.S. record, said the report.
Cause_Specific	Losses from Hurricane Harvey, which caused massive flooding in Texas, exceeded 125 billion dollars, which ranked second only to Hurricane Katrina, the costliest storm in the 38-year period of record.
Cause_Specific	Hurricanes Maria and Irma had total damages of 90 billion dollars and 50 billion dollars, respectively.
Cause_General	Hurricane Maria now ranks as third costliest weather and climate disaster on record for the nation, with Irma coming in close behind as fifth costliest, it said.
Cause_General	"""Since 1980, the U.S. has sustained 219 weather and climate disasters that have exceeded 1.5 trillion dollars in overall damages to date,"" the U.S. agency wrote."

Distant_Historical	Popular tourist destination Thailand was among the worst affected, along with Indonesia, India and Sri Lanka.
Distant_Historical	Many of the 5,395 people killed in Thailand were foreign tourists holidaying along the shores of its idyllic islands and beaches.
Cause_General	Thailand’s warning system includes warning towers, a network of detection buoys in the sea and public announcement systems.
Distant_Evaluation	“Around 70 to 80 percent, or around 2,000 pieces, need to be taken care of.
Distant_Evaluation	We set up this system since 2006 so it needs to be maintained,” Kobchai Boonyaorana, deputy director-general of the Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department, told Reuters, referring to various equipment.
Distant_Evaluation	“Batteries need to be changed,” he added, “I’ve ordered that this needs to be done urgently particularly in the southern region which is a tourist region.
Distant_Evaluation	There might be some places where the equipment is damaged but not many places.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Prasert Kunneang, public relations officer at the National Disaster Warning Center in Bangkok, said the tsunami warning system is tested daily and Thailand is prepared in the event of a future tsunami.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If there is a tsunami tomorrow, the warning system would work,” Prasert told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	With its picturesque beaches, gilded palaces and temples and balmy climate, Thailand remains a firm foreign tourist favorite.
Cause_General	Tourism accounts for 12 percent of Thailand’s economic output, and has been a rare bright spot for Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, whose growth has lagged peers in recent years.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Other forms of communication will be used to warn people about a tsunami while the equipment undergoes maintenance, said Prasert, including television and radio announcements.
Main	Facing complaints that it has not done enough to rebuild New Orleans, the Bush administration announced Wednesday that it would ask Congress for $4.2 billion more to compensate Louisiana residents whose homes were severely damaged by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The money will come from $18 billion that the administration said last month it would request from Congress this year for hurricane relief.
Distant_Evaluation	The announcement was praised by Louisiana officials who said that the $4.2 billion, when added to $7.7 billion in rebuilding money approved by Congress last year, would be enough to help anyone in the state who owned a storm-wrecked home.
Main_Consequence	''I am here to say a special thank you to the president,'' said Gov.
Main_Consequence	Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, who flew in for a news conference at the Capitol.
Distant_Evaluation	Ms. Blanco, a Democrat, had criticized the White House for falling short of President Bush's pledge to ''do what it takes'' to reconstruct New Orleans.
Cause_General	The $4.2 billion request was a turnabout for the administration, which three weeks ago rejected legislation proposed by Representative Richard H. Baker, a Louisiana Republican, to create a nonprofit group to buy out flooded homes, the plan favored by Ms. Blanco.
Distant_Evaluation	Louisiana officials had also complained that Congress had shortchanged the state in a $29 billion relief package in December that gave $5.2 billion in housing reconstruction money to Mississippi, which suffered far less damage than Louisiana but which has a Republican governor and two Republican senators.
Cause_General	Last week, Ms. Blanco threatened to try to block a federal sale of oil and gas leases off the Gulf Coast, saying it was ''time to play hardball.''
Cause_Specific	But in the past week, state officials said, Donald E. Powell, the president's coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding, became convinced that the federal government should do more to help homeowners in the flood plain who did not have flood insurance.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The $4.2 billion will be part of an $18 billion supplemental budget request for hurricane-related costs in the current fiscal year that the Bush administration expects to present to Congress this week.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The full request will include money for loans to help storm-damaged small businesses, to repair flood walls and to replenish the Federal Emergency Management Agency's disaster relief fund.
Cause_Specific	Officials in Louisiana and New Orleans had said more aid was needed to cover huge gaps between the cost of wind and flood damage from the two hurricanes and the amount that homeowners and landlords would receive in insurance payments.
Distant_Evaluation	Insurance industry analysts have estimated that the gap in coverage on houses and rental units totals $8.4 billion across the state, including $5.4 billion in New Orleans.
Cause_Specific	State officials had said they would need as much as $12 billion in assistance to rebuild houses, provide incentives to apartment developers and help compensate homeowners who choose to sell ruined homes at a loss.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Andrew Kopplin, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, said about 100,000 severely damaged and 67,000 less-damaged homes in Louisiana would be the main beneficiaries of the money.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Kopplin said grants would be capped at $150,000 per home, less payments by FEMA and insurance companies.
Cause_General	The $4.2 billion plan does not include money for commercial property owners.
Distant_Evaluation	Insurance analysts estimate that the insurance shortfall totals $9.5 billion for state businesses ranging from small groceries to large corporations.
Cause_General	Relief for those businesses comes mainly from Small Business Administration loans, which so far total about $485 million.
Distant_Evaluation	The Bush administration had raised concerns about whether Louisiana had a clear plan for reconstruction and whether it could be held accountable for the huge influx of federal aid it was about to receive.
Cause_Specific	But on Wednesday, Mr. Powell said that he had become convinced that the state was addressing both issues.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Ms. Blanco said that on Monday the recovery authority would release spending guidelines for the federal aid, which will be given to the state in the form of community development block grants administered by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Cause_General	The guidelines will not be a detailed rebuilding plan for New Orleans, which is still being developed by a commission appointed by Mayor C. Ray Nagin.
Distant_Anecdotal	Mr. Isaacson said the guidelines would make clear that only homes in certain neighborhoods would be eligible for money, which could include aid to help homeowners raise their homes and make them more flood- and hurricane-resistant.
Cause_General	There are no longer corpses in plain sight, as there were for days after Hurricane Katrina hit.
Main	But nearly six months after the storm, officials believe there are still dozens of unrecovered bodies in New Orleans.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They even have a pretty good idea where they are.
Main	But no one is looking for them.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Instead, they have been left in muck-filled houses or piles of debris for family members to stumble upon.
Distant_Anecdotal	Last Saturday, for example, Alicia and Herman Robertson found their nephew, Kendrick Smith, in the bedroom where he had lain face down since the storm.
Cause_General	Family members, scattered to Houston, San Antonio and Ville Platte, La., said they had repeatedly asked the authorities to go by the house, at 2305 Flood Street, to look for Mr. Smith, 31.
Distant_Anecdotal	''The city never done nothing,'' Mr. Robertson said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''It was horrible to see one's loved one laid out like that.''
Cause_General	Based on reports from family members, officials have compiled a list of 225 addresses in the Ninth Ward whose residents are still missing.
Cause_General	But the search has become snarled in yet another tangle over agency jurisdiction and cost.
Cause_Specific	The New Orleans Fire Department's urban search and rescue team began combing the Ninth Ward in early October, but stopped two months later when money for overtime ran out, Steven P. Glynn, the chief of special operations for the department, said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''The superintendent had to decide whether to continue that operation or provide adequate fire protection,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	The process of ''clearing'' a house from the list is not simple, Chief Glynn said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Even if the house is still standing, furniture must be removed and as much as two feet of mud shoveled out before searchers can be certain no body is there.
Distant_Evaluation	For those houses that have collapsed, the current plan is to have a search-and-rescue team work alongside the Army Corps of Engineers, which is charged with debris clearance and cleanup.
Cause_General	Chief Glynn said that he had explained the situation to at least half a dozen officials from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but that he had yet to get a promise of money for more searches, which would cost about $400,000 for three months.
Distant_Evaluation	Nicol Andrews, a spokeswoman for FEMA, said the Fire Department had not filled out a ''formal project worksheet'' requesting money.
Distant_Evaluation	But, Ms. Andrews said, ''by all accounts, this is something FEMA absolutely would pay for.''
Distant_Evaluation	The wait is maddening, said Chief Glynn, a third-generation New Orleans firefighter.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's really not the dead, because you can't do much for those people,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's the families, who are living with this.''
Cause_General	Some of those families have given DNA samples to the state, called the police and tried to search themselves.
Distant_Anecdotal	Lamont Marrero, 26, believes his mother, who was partly paralyzed, is still in her Ninth Ward home, but when he tried to enter, he found the iron security doors rusted shut.
Distant_Anecdotal	''We don't have any answers at all,'' Mr. Marrero said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''We don't know anything.
Distant_Anecdotal	That's the only thing left to do, is search the house.''
Main	TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s nuclear regulator has approved an operations extension for a 40-year-old reactor near Tokyo that was damaged in the same earthquake and tsunami that sparked the Fukushima disaster nearly eight years ago, a move likely to be controversial.

Cause_General	The reactor, Tokai Daini, also has the same basic design as those that melted down in the Fukushima crisis and will be the first boiling water reactor (BWR) to be approved for a lifetime extension of 20 years.
Distant_Evaluation	The approval will be a boost for operator, Japan Atomic Power Co (Japco) [JATOM.UL], which is owned by the country’s main utilities and is bleeding cash because of the shutdown of its two nuclear power units.
Main	Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority gave the green light to the extension on Wednesday, the regulator said.
Cause_General	Tokai Daini is 115 km (62 miles) northeast of central Tokyo, the closest reactor to the capital, and has nearly a million people living within a 30 kilometer radius.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“It’s impossible to evacuate these people all at once, and no matter how much time is spent on them it won’t be possible to set up escape plans,” said Toru Umino, mayor of nearby Naka city, on Oct. 24 to a group of citizens opposed to nuclear power, according to a video posted on local media.
Cause_General	Umino has been one of the few public officials to come out in opposition to the Tokai Daini extension.
Cause_General	A call to mayoral staff on Wednesday went unanswered after office hours.
Cause_General	Naka is one of five municipalities near Tokai village, where the reactor is located, that have an agreement with Japco to be consulted on any restart, although they don’t have veto rights.
Distant_Historical	Tokai also has atomic research and other facilities, and was the site of a nuclear crisis in 1999, when workers at a processing plant not connected to Tokai Daini attempted to mix uranium in a bucket.
Distant_Historical	Two workers died and 300,000 people were told to stay indoors for up to 30 hours, after radiation escape into surrounding areas.
Distant_Historical	At the time it was the world’s worst nuclear incident since Chernobyl in 1986, based on an international rating scale.
Cause_General	Local opposition to the extension of the Tokai plant has been strong, according to Japanese media, although residents often will not give their views.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It’s very difficult to express one’s opinions around here,” said Alison Watts, an Australian who works as a translator and has lived in Tokai for 25 years.
Distant_Anecdotal	Watts said she was opposed to the restart because the design of the reactors is similar to those at Fukushima and because of the threat of more big earthquakes.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A company spokesman told Reuters the nuclear operator will build a tsunami protection wall to fortify Tokai Daini.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Japan Atomic must also complete safety upgrades, with a restart of the plant is not expected till the 2020s.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Japan Atomic will need the approval of Tokai and prefectural authorities as well before it can resume operations.
Distant_Historical	Tokai Daini was operating when a massive earthquake struck off the northeast coast of Japan on March 11, 2011, creating a tsunami that swamped Tokyo Electric Power’s Fukushima Daichi station 113 kilometers to the north, causing explosions and meltdowns at three reactors.
Distant_Historical	The Tokai Daini plant shut down automatically but sustained damage, according to Japan Atomic.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While the extension will be a further boost for Japan’s resurgent nuclear industry, the sector will still miss a government target of providing at least a fifth of the country’s electricity by 2030, an analysis by Reuters showed last week.
Cause_General	Nine reactors have restarted, all of them pressurized water reactors located far from Tokyo, while the stigma of Fukushima still hangs over use of the older BWR technology.

Main	TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 that struck near remote islands belonging to Honduras on Tuesday was felt across northern Central America but there were no immediate reports of casualties or major damage.
Main_Consequence	The quake rattled windows in the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa roughly 323 miles (519 km) to the east and was felt at least as far north as the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, but no damage was immediately reported.
Distant_Anecdotal	Rodrigo Anaya Rodriguez was in a hammock inside his house near the popular tourist site of Bacalar Lake near Mexico’s Caribbean coast when he felt three tremors.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It felt like a bulldozer was driving past,” he said.
Distant_Anecdotal	“It didn’t last long but was very violent.”
Distant_Anecdotal	He ran to his balcony and saw electricity posts and cables swaying.
Distant_Evaluation	In Honduras, firefighters said some residents in southern neighborhoods fled their homes after feeling the shaking.
Cause_General	The country operates a small naval base on Great Swan Island, about 27 miles (44 km) west of the quake’s epicenter, but it was not immediately clear how the tremors affected the station.
Cause_General	“We have reports that it was felt in the majority of the country, but we don’t have reports of damage,” said Lizandro Rosales, director of Honduras’ contingencies commission.
Cause_General	The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake, initially reported as a magnitude 7.8, was centered 125 miles (202 km)northeast of Barra Patuca in Honduras and 191 miles (307 km)southwest of George Town in the Cayman Islands.
Distant_Evaluation	The quake was very shallow, at only 6.2 miles (10 km), which would have amplified its effect.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center initially warned that tsunami waves up to 1 meter (3 feet) above tide level could hit parts of Honduras, Belize and Puerto Rico along with the U.S. and British Virgin Islands.
Cause_General	About two hours after the quake, the center said the threat had passed, withdrawing all tsunami advisories connected with the quake.
Main_Consequence	The tremors were felt in Belize City, but there were no immediate reports of damage.
Distant_Evaluation	Belize’s minister in charge of emergency management, Edmond Castro, spoke on local radio to urge people living in low lying coastal areas and islands to stay alert for potentially dangerous waves.

Main	SYDNEY (Reuters) - A powerful magnitude 7 undersea earthquake struck east of New Caledonia’s Loyalty Islands in the South Pacific on Monday, sending small tsunamis towards New Caledonia and neighboring Vanuatu, where authorities ordered evacuations.
Main_Consequence	The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) in Hawaii issued a tsunami warning for coastlines within 300 kms (186 mile) of the epicenter, but later said the danger had largely passed.
Cause_General	Monday’s quake, initially reported as magnitude 7.3, struck at a shallow depth of 10 km (six miles) about 82 kms (51 miles) east of New Caledonia.
Cause_General	It was the second major tremor in the same area in just over 12 hours and the third in the past month.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are a little bit scared, we have had an earthquake last night and today it was quite a big one,” said Wayan Rigault, communications manager at Hotel Nengone Village on the island of Mare, which is the closest landmass to the epicenter.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Rigault said there was no immediate damage, but guests were on alert for a formal evacuation warning.
Distant_Evaluation	Small tsunamis were detected and waves may have reached up to one meter (three feet) above the high tide level in parts of New Caledonia and smaller in Vanuatu, the PTWC said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Minor sea level fluctuations...may continue over the next few hours,” a statement from the agency said.
Main_Consequence	Vanuatu’s National Disaster Management Office advised people in southern provinces to evacuate coastal areas for higher ground..
Cause_General	New Caledonia’s civil security agency made no plans to evacuate coastal places immediately.
Cause_General	Authorities in Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii said there were no tsunami threats to the coastlines of those countries.
Main	The former owner of a Yonkers house where a doctor was found shot to death last week has been charged in the murder, the Yonkers police said yesterday.
Distant_Evaluation	They also suggested that he may have had an accomplice.
Main	The former owner, Samuel Saunders, 60, of the Bronx, was arrested yesterday and arraigned in Yonkers Criminal Court on a charge of murder in the second degree.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If convicted, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Saunders bought the home, a three-bedroom, ranch-style house on Brendon Hill Road near the Scarsdale border, in June 2005 for $825,000, with a $650,000 mortgage.
Distant_Historical	But the house was in some stage of foreclosure when the victim, Dr. Leandro Lozada, bought it eight months ago, the police said.
Cause_General	Specifics of the sale were not available.
Cause_General	Because of the continuing investigation and the possibility of suspects still at large, the police provided few details of Mr. Saunders's arrest or the case.
Cause_General	They would not discuss any possible motive for the crime.
Distant_Evaluation	But the arrest ended at least one chapter in one of the city's more baffling homicides.
Cause_Specific	On Wednesday, Dr. Lozada, 46, who operated a medical clinic for the poor in the Bronx, was found by his female companion dead on the floor of his bedroom.
Cause_Specific	He had been shot at point-blank range several times, including at least once in the face and once in the back of the head, the police said.
Cause_General	No weapon was found at the scene.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The doctor lived alone and there were no signs of a struggle, prompting the police to speculate that he knew his attacker.
Distant_Historical	When Dr. Lozada completed the purchase of the house, he changed the locks, the police said yesterday.
Distant_Evaluation	Edmund Hartnett, the Yonkers police commissioner, said yesterday at police headquarters, ''This act would be very difficult for one person to commit.''
Cause_General	He did not elaborate.
Cause_General	The commissioner said investigators had recovered items of interest from Mr. Saunders's apartment, including clothing that was possibly stained with human blood.
Cause_General	It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Saunders had hired a lawyer.
Distant_Historical	He has a criminal record, including grand larceny in 1996, the police said.
Distant_Anecdotal	Kim VanZandt, who lives next to the house, said Mr. Saunders had put it back on the market after living there just one month.
Distant_Anecdotal	She said he believed when he bought the house that it had a larger backyard, and was angry when the owners of a house abutting his property erected a stone wall in what he considered his yard.
Distant_Evaluation	At Mr. Saunders's apartment building in the Bronx, on Pennyfield Avenue near the Throgs Neck Bridge, a woman answering the buzzer for his apartment declined to be interviewed.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's private,'' she said.
Distant_Historical	Dr. Lozada was a native of the Dominican Republic who earned his medical degree at the University of Santo Domingo.
Cause_General	He spent much of his time at his practice, Hispanic Pediatrics, at 229 East Kingsbridge Road in the Bronx, where he treated mainly immigrant patients.
Cause_General	On Thursday, dozens of patients stopped by Dr. Lozada's office to set up a shrine in his memory.
Main	MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Police in Mexico have arrested a couple suspected of involvement in the murder of at least 10 women, as well as the sale of a baby girl, authorities said late on Friday.
Cause_General	Alejandro Gomez, attorney general of the State of Mexico, which borders the capital, said in a video posted on Facebook that the couple were tracked down during a search for three missing women, one of whom disappeared along with her baby.
Cause_General	The couple, a man and a woman, were arrested on Thursday after they left a house in the Mexico City suburb of Ecatepec with a baby carriage in which investigators had hoped to find the missing child, Gomez said in the video.
Cause_General	Instead, they found a black bag containing human remains.
Cause_General	Subsequent investigations found the couple had previously deposited other human remains nearby.
Cause_Specific	Under questioning, the man identified as Juan Carlos N detailed taking part in the murders of at least 10 women, Gomez added.
Cause_General	The motive for the killings was unclear.
Cause_Specific	The couple admitted to having sold the missing two-month-old baby girl, who was found safe and returned to her grandmother.
Main	The couple who acquired the baby were arrested, Gomez said.
Distant_Historical	Thousands of women have disappeared or been murdered during a sharp increase in violence in Mexico in recent years.
Distant_Historical	According to government statistics, there were at least 2,585 suspected murders of women last year, up from 1,755 in 2015.
Distant_Historical	Of the total, the largest number were in the State of Mexico, the most populous region of the country.
Distant_Evaluation	Ecatepec has become notorious as a center of the killings.
Main	BERLIN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A refugee suspected of the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl in western Germany has been arrested in Iraq, the German Interior Ministry confirmed on Friday.
Main	According to Interior Minister and Christian Social Union (CSU) leader Horst Seehofer, Kurdish security forces seized the 20-year-old Ali B. in northern Iraq.
Main_Consequence	"Seehofer thanked local authorities for their swift assistance in the investigation and said that the German foreign office and police had begun filing a request for the suspect's extradition ""in accordance with international regulations."""
Cause_Specific	The asylum seeker Ali B. stands accused of having raped and murdered the 14-year-old girl Susanna F. before successfully fleeing with his entire family from the German refugee center in Wiesbaden-Erbenheim to his native country of Iraq.
Cause_General	In the event, airport personnel failed to notice that the names given by the group in Arabic on the boarding tickets for the flights to Iraq via Istanbul did not match the identification papers.
Cause_General	Seehofer announced the news of the suspect's subsequent arrest during a hastily-convened press conference in the town of Quedlinburg.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It is important for me to inform the population that no one can feel safe (from prosecution) anywhere on Earth after this horrible crime thanks to international cooperation"", the CSU leader said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, a spokesperson for the Wiesbaden state prosecution office noted that Germany has not signed an extradition treaty with Iraq and that it was hence a matter for local judiciary authorities to decide whether or not to fulfil Berlin's request.
Cause_General	"An Iraqi trial as an alternative solution is not possible under the German constitution as the crime would ""carry a potential death sentence"" in the suspect's home country."
Cause_General	Susanna F. was a member of Germany's Jewish community who volunteered at the refugee center in Wiesbaden-Erbenheim and reportedly knew the brother of the suspect.
Cause_General	After disappearing two weeks ago, police revealed on Thursday that they had found the mutilated body of the 14-year-old and issued a public search warrant for Ali B. as the primary suspect in the case.
Cause_General	German police reiterated on Friday that they were still asking people with any knowledge of the case to come forward in order to enhance their understandings of the events which led to the teenager's death.
Cause_General	A 35-year-old refugee with Turkish nationality was temporarily taken into custody on suspicion of being involved in the murder but has since been released again.
Cause_General	State prosecutors emphasized that no evidence had surfaced prior to Ali B.
Cause_General	's airborne escape on May 23 to link him to the disappearance of Susanna F. Only on the following day did a 13-year-old boy living at the same refugee center report to police that the suspect had boasted about committing the crime.
Distant_Evaluation	The case has provoked widespread outrage in Germany, not least because Ali B. was known to police as being violent and had already been accused of raping an 11-year-old girl living at the same Wiesbaden-Erbenheim refugee center.
Distant_Historical	The suspect was formally denied asylum status at the end of 2016 and subsequently filed an ongoing appeal.
Distant_Evaluation	"Carsten Schneider, the German Social Democrats' (SPD) deputy parliamentary faction leader, called for a swift clarification of how the suspect managed to escape and how he could now be placed before a court in Germany ""as fast as possible."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Free Democratic Party (FDP) leader Christian Lindner further opined in the newspaper BILD that the incident raised the question of ""why rejected asylums seekers are not deported more resolutely."""
Main	HANOI, June 29 (Xinhua) -- During a two-day raid in Vietnam's northern Son La province, police killed two kingpins of a ring which trafficked large amounts of heroin from Laos to Vietnam, local media reported on Friday.
Main	During the raid from Wednesday to Thursday with the presence of nearly 300 police officers with many armoured vehicles and telecommunications signal-jamming equipment, the two kingpins, Nguyen Thanh Tuan, 34, and Nguyen Van Thuan, 35, were killed in gunfire, after they refused to surrender and opened fire to the officers, online newspaper VnExpress reported.
Main_Consequence	After the two men died at their den in Van Ho district, three of their underlings surrendered.
Cause_General	Local police confiscated three grenades, four military guns, 415 bullets and many gas cylinders at the den which was fortified with bullet-proof bunkers, explosives and high-power riffles.
Cause_General	According to Vietnamese investigators, Tuan, born in Hanoi, established new drug trafficking rings after old ones were busted by local police.
Cause_General	He never showed up at drug transactions, just using phones to run many rings from distance in the last 10 years.
Distant_Historical	In 2015, Tuan escaped after one of his rings' members was arrested when transporting and hiding a total 490 cakes of heroin weighing over 170 kilograms in Hanoi.
Distant_Historical	According to investigators, by 2015, his rings had trafficked nearly 1,200 cakes of heroin.
Cause_Specific	On Thursday, border guards of central Nghe An province conducted a raid in Ky Son district, trying to arrest two local drug traffickers, Voice of Vietnam reported.
Cause_Specific	One of the traffickers opened fire vigorously, injuring two border guard officers, and then escaping to a jungle.
Cause_General	The other trafficker, Vu Ba Xenh, a 39-year-old teacher of a primary school in the district, was arrested, and then he confessed that they transported drugs from Laos to Vietnam.
Cause_General	The border guards confiscated 20 cakes of heroin, seven kilos of methamphetamine, 12,000 pills of synthetic drugs, one handgun and 15 bullets.
Cause_General	According to Vietnamese law, those convicted of smuggling over 600 grams of heroin or more than 2.5 kilos of methamphetamine are punishable by death.
Cause_General	Making or trading 100 grams of heroin or 300 grams of other illegal drugs also faces death penalty.

Main	BELGRADE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Serbian lawyer Dragoslav Misa Ognjanovic was gunned down here on Saturday by an unknown perpetrator while his son was wounded, the police confirmed Sunday.
Main	The murder of the 56-year-old lawyer who was involved in some of the biggest cases in the past decade took place in New Belgrade around 7:30 p.m. local time in front of an apartment building.
Cause_General	Head of the Criminal Police Directorate Dejan Kovacevic stated in a statement that the criminal police inspectors are conducting the investigation, while several other units are engaged in an ongoing intensive search for the perpetrator who killed lawyer Ognjanovic and wounded his 26-year-old son.
Distant_Evaluation	Ognjanovic had represented some of the most famous clients.
Distant_Historical	According to the reports, he was one of legal advisors of the former Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic who was trialed for war crimes at the Hague, Netherlands until his death in 2006.
Distant_Historical	Moreover, media reports connected Ognjanovic with Luka Bojovic, a citizen of Serbia who serves 18 years of prison in Spain due to organized crime charges, as well as Djordje Prelic, a leader of Partizan football fans convicted for murdering a French football fan in downtown Belgrade.
Cause_Specific	According to reports, in recent years Ognjanovic mostly worked for Bojovic, while on the other hand, in past several months numerous Bojovic's associates and friends were shot dead in Belgrade in an alleged war of clans for the domination over the illegal narcotics trade.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	President of the Bar Association of Serbia Viktor Gostiljac told Tanjug News Agency that lawyers are in shock after the murder of Ognjanovic and announced that the association will stop working next week in protest.
Distant_Evaluation	Gostiljac said on behalf of the members of the bar association that this represents an attack on all lawyers and demanded immediate action from the competent authorities.
Main_Consequence	Immediately after the shooting, the police started a thorough operation of stopping and searching all suspicious vehicles and passers-by.
Main	CHICAGO (Reuters) - White Chicago police officer Jason Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder on Friday for the 2014 shooting of black teenager Laquan McDonald, touching off celebratory street demonstrations in a case that had laid bare tensions between the black community and police.
Cause_General	Van Dyke, 40, was also convicted of 16 counts of aggravated battery, one count for each of the shots fired.
Distant_Historical	McDonald, 17, was killed while armed with a knife as he walked down the center of a street in the third-largest U.S. city.
Cause_Specific	Jurors said they faulted Van Dyke for escalating the conflict when he could have waited for more police assistance, such as an officer with a non-lethal Taser weapon.
Cause_General	Van Dyke sat emotionless as the verdict was read.
Main_Consequence	Cook County Circuit Court Judge Vincent Gaughan immediately revoked bail and Van Dyke was escorted out of the courtroom and into Cook County Jail.
Cause_General	He faces up to 20 years in prison for the second-degree murder conviction and up to 30 years for each of the 16 counts of aggravated battery.
Distant_Evaluation	His conviction seemed to quell any potential unrest of the kind that has occurred in other U.S. cities in recent years when white officers have been cleared of charges in the shooting deaths of black men.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The end of this trial brings an opportunity for the community to come together,” special prosecutor Joseph McMahon told reporters.
Distant_Historical	Police killings of mostly unarmed black men elsewhere in the United States helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement and became an issue in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign.
Distant_Historical	Chicago had its own unrest when a police dashboard camera video was released more than a year after the shooting which occurred on the night of Oct. 20, 2014.
Distant_Historical	The video showed Van Dyke shooting McDonald as he walked down the middle of the street, veering slightly away from the officer.
Distant_Historical	The aftermath led to the dismissal of the city’s police superintendent and calls for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to resign.
Main_Consequence	After Friday’s verdict, small, peaceful demonstrations assembled in central Chicago.
Main_Consequence	About 100 people marched toward a gathering spot.
Distant_Evaluation	“Whose streets?
Distant_Evaluation	Our streets!” some chanted.
Distant_Evaluation	One protester bellowed into a megaphone: “This is what black power looks like.”

Distant_Anecdotal	“We are in celebration mode but we also want to hold more people accountable,” said one of the protesters, Darius Parker, 28, who estimated the crowd would have been 10 times larger had Van Dyke been acquitted.
Cause_Specific	The 12-person jury, which included one black person, began deliberations on Thursday afternoon.
Cause_Specific	After failing to reach a verdict on Thursday night, they began anew on Friday, finding enough mitigating circumstances to convict Van Dyke of second- rather than first-degree murder, jurors told reporters.
Distant_Evaluation	“In Van Dyke’s mind, he was doing the right thing.
Distant_Evaluation	He was experiencing an extreme threat ... he needed to protect himself,” one man on the jury told reporters.
Cause_General	The jurors who spoke to reporters were not identified by name.
Distant_Evaluation	But jurors were swayed by the video, which prosecutors showed repeatedly during the three-week trial and which jurors reviewed during deliberations.
Distant_Evaluation	“We kept watching the video where he kept making the steps forward,” said another juror.
Distant_Evaluation	“We watched that more than once.
Distant_Evaluation	More than three times.”
Distant_Evaluation	Van Dyke testified in his own defense, saying he feared for his safety and fired because McDonald was advancing on him.
Distant_Evaluation	Both the officer and his lawyers argued that the angle of the video did not reflect the incident from Van Dyke’s perspective.

Distant_Evaluation	But Van Dyke’s testimony seemed rehearsed and “we just didn’t buy it,” a third juror said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Defense lawyer Daniel Herbert said he would appeal and push for a change of venue, which was denied to the defense in this trial.
Distant_Evaluation	“We knew coming into it with a Cook County venue in this case with the Cook County jury there was not a chance in the world we were going to come away with a complete not guilty,” Herbert told reporters.

Cause_Specific	Ramon Alberto Escobar, 47, an El Salvador native and convicted burglar who has been repeatedly deported from the United States, was arrested on Monday after he allegedly clubbed a sleeping man in the head with bolt-cutters in the ocean-front city of Santa Monica, authorities said.
Cause_Specific	Seven other men were similarly attacked in Santa Monica and Los Angeles earlier this month, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.
Cause_General	Police have said one victim was sleeping under a pier after a night of fishing and that most of the rest of the victims were homeless, including three men battered with a baseball bat in downtown Los Angeles on Sept. 16.
Cause_Specific	Two of those victims and the man attacked beneath the pier died of their injuries.
Cause_Specific	Some survivors were left in a coma.
Main	On Wednesday, the district attorney’s office formally charged Escobar with three counts of murder, five counts of attempted murder and four counts of robbery.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If convicted of murder, he faces a minimum sentence of life without parole.
Distant_Historical	U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials said Tuesday that Escobar had been deported back to El Salvador six times between 1977 and 2011 and has six felony convictions for burglary and illegal re-entry.
Distant_Historical	Police have said he spent five years in a Texas prison for burglary from 1995 to 2000.
Distant_Historical	Escobar in 2016 filed an appeal of his immigration case, which U.S. courts granted in December of that year, and he was released from ICE custody on an “order of supervision” in January 2017, ICE spokesperson Paige Hughes said by email.
Cause_General	Escobar, now jailed without bond, briefly appeared in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday, but the arraignment was postponed until Nov. 8.
Cause_General	No plea was entered.
Cause_General	Judge Gustavo Sztraicher granted a defense motion barring public dissemination of the defendant’s image, including by photograph or courtroom sketch drawing, so as not to prejudice potential witnesses who might identify him for prosecutors.
Distant_Evaluation	Escobar appeared expressionless and said nothing except to answer, “Yes, sir,” when asked if he agreed to the postponement.
Cause_General	Defense lawyers declined to speak to reporters.
Distant_Evaluation	Meanwhile, police in Houston said Escobar was a “person of interest” in the investigation into the disappearance of an aunt and uncle with whom Escobar lived before they were reported missing in late August by other relatives.
Cause_General	The aunt’s van was later found burned and abandoned in Galveston, Texas, according to Houston police spokesman Kese Smith.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Escobar was questioned by Houston homicide detectives on Aug. 30, but they lacked probable cause to detain him at the time, Smith told Reuters on Wednesday, adding that Houston detectives would seek to “re-interview” Escobar in California.
Distant_Evaluation	Hayes said Escobar “fled” Texas by car soon after he was questioned in Houston, arriving in Los Angeles on Sept. 5.
Cause_General	The first attack police linked to him occurred three days later.

Main	LONDON, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- London Mayor Sadiq Khan and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick announced Tuesday they were adding an extra 122 police officers to a violent crime task force to crack down on knife attacks in the British capital.
Cause_General	The move comes just days after the London Assembly said an investigation into serious crime was being started as figures revealed there have been 100 homicides so far this year in the capital.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The extra officers will temporarily move from the Met's roads and transport policing command and will be ready to start next Monday as part of an elite team tasked with making arrests and taking weapons off the streets in the areas of London with the highest concentrations of knife and other forms of violent crime.
Cause_General	The task force, originally launched in April, has so far made 895 arrests, carried out 1,400 weapons sweeps, removing 212 knives and nearly 200 offensive weapons from the streets of London.
Distant_Evaluation	"Khan said: ""The level of violent crime in London is unacceptably high."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"As well as setting up the new dedicated violent crime task force to focus on the areas worst affected, I'm bringing together the Met Police with local councils, charities, community groups and others to work on a public health approach to tackling knife crime."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""The causes of violent crime are extremely complex, and involve culture, community, gangs, drugs, poverty, and a lack of opportunities and have been made much worse by the government's huge cuts to the Metropolitan Police and youth services across our city, resulting in police numbers falling to the lowest level in 20 years."""
Cause_General	The roads and transport policing command is the largest police unit in Britain, made up of more than 2,300 police and community support officers.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, the London Assembly police and crime committee is currently investigating how violence across London can be reduced.
Distant_Evaluation	New analysis at city hall shows that so far this year domestic violence is just as much an issue as other types of violence.
Cause_General	Of the 100 cases, 38 homicides happened in the street and 35 in the home.
Cause_General	Ten killings involved a gun and 59 involved a knife, with half of the victims aged under 25.

Main	CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Saturday sentenced 75 members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood to death over charges of violence and murder, a judicial source said.
Distant_Historical	"The case, publicly known as ""Breaking up Rabaa Sit-in,"" dated back to 2013."
Cause_Specific	The convicted were charged with causing deaths of policemen, attempted murder and vandalism, the source told Xinhua.
Cause_General	The court referred the sentence to Grand Mufti, the country's highest Islamic official who will give the religious judgment of all preliminary death sentences.
Distant_Evaluation	The Mufti's opinion is non-binding as it is usually considered a formality.
Cause_General	The defendants included Essam El-Erian, the deputy leader of the Brotherhood's freedom and Justice Party, Moahmed al-Beltagi, secretary general of the party, Safwat Hegazi, prominent preacher of the Brotherhood, and Assem Abdel Maguid, prominent member of the group's Shura Council, as well as other Islamists leaders.
Distant_Historical	Rabaa was one of two sites where supporters of the ousted Islamist President Mohamed Morsi gathered in the weeks following his overthrow by the army in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule.
Distant_Historical	The sit-in was dispersed violently by security men, after many warnings by the government.
Distant_Historical	The protesters have been accused of hindering traffic, causing public disorder, terrifying the residents as they possessed weapons.
Cause_General	Morsi's Brotherhood group was banned by the government and most of his group have received verdicts varied from death, to life sentences over violence, killing and espionage.
Cause_General	Morsi is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence over inciting deadly clashes between his supporters and opponents in late 2012 and a 25-year jail term over leaking classified documents to Qatar.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The verdicts can be appealed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Ahmad Ban, expert with Cairo-based Nile Center for religious movement affairs, and a Brotherhood dissident, said the verdicts could be appealed several times, predicting president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will pardon several figures including Morsi when if finally comes to execution.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""The pardon will be focused mainly on the Islamists who weren't involved directly in killing security men or civilians,"" he said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He added both the country and the Brotherhood group will seek reconciliation, but each side is waiting for more concessions.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Sentencing for more than 660 other Islamists in another case was set for Sept. 8, according to state-run Ahram news website.
Cause_General	The case involves the Muslim Brotherhood's Supreme Guide Mohammed Badie and a photographer Mahmoud Abu Zeid.
Cause_General	Charges range from murder to damaging public property.
Cause_General	Since Morsi's ouster, Egypt has been facing a wave of terror attacks that have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers as well as civilians.
Cause_General	A Sinai-based militant group affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) regional terrorist group has claimed responsibility for most of the attacks in Egypt over the past few years.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, the Egyptian forces have killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by newly re-elected President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief then, following Morsi's ouster.

Error	REUTERS/Radovan Stoklasa/File Photo
Cause_Specific	The killing of Jan Kuciak, 27, and his fiancée at their home outside the capital Bratislava in February stoked public anger over corruption and prompted the largest protests in Slovakia since the end of Communist rule in 1989.
Cause_General	Kuciak probed fraud involving businessmen with Slovak political ties and had worked on a story about suspected Mafia links of Italians working in Slovakia.
Cause_General	Police carried out raids last week and a court on Sunday ordered four people jailed until trial for the murders.
Main	“We have more steps prepared which we want to take, so there is high probability there will be more charges,” Slovak general prosecutor Jaromir Ciznar told a news conference.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’re still in the stage where charges have been pressed and we should not be too optimistic but the evidence is very strong,” he added.
Cause_General	Prosecutors said the killer was paid 70,000 euros, of which 50,000 euros was cash and the rest forgiven debt.
Distant_Evaluation	Police arrested a woman on Friday identified as A.Z.
Distant_Evaluation	and said she had likely paid the money to the killers but the motive and whether she worked for someone else was unclear.
Cause_General	A police investigator told a briefing that weapons, cars, a cell phone used during the crime, and a bullet corresponding to the cartridge case found at the crime scene were seized in home searches last week.
Distant_Evaluation	Police chief Milan Lucansky said the suspected killer was a former police officer.
Cause_General	In his final story, published posthumously, Kuciak reported on an Italian living in Slovakia with past business links to two Slovaks who later worked in then-prime minister Robert Fico’s office.
Distant_Evaluation	Both of the Slovaks resigned but deny connections to the murder.
Distant_Evaluation	Their Italian former business partner has also denied connections with the mafia and the murder but was detained on a European drug trafficking warrant in March and extradited to Italy in May.
Cause_General	Weeks of protests that drew tens of thousands in March forced the departure of long-serving leader Fico as well as the interior minister and police chief but the coalition government remains in power.

Cause_General	Francis “Cadillac Frank” Salemme, 85, looked through paperwork as three of club owner Steven DiSarro’s children spoke in Boston federal court about how they suffered for over two decades not knowing what happened to their father.
Cause_Specific	Salemme, who was sentenced alongside associate Paul Weadick, 63, to a mandatory life prison term by U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, was only charged after DiSarro’s remains were found in 2016 buried behind a mill in Providence, Rhode Island.
Cause_General	Nick DiSarro, one of DiSarro’s sons, described the pain he felt as sat through each day of Salemme’s trial listening to testimony about his father’s brutal murder.
Distant_Evaluation	“As hard as it was to hear the pure evil day in and day out, I got the answers necessary,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	Michael DiSarro, another of the late DiSarro’s children, told Salemme: “You’re a coward and a murderer, and I am happy to see you will be spending what days you have left in a cell.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Salemme, who is expected to appeal his June conviction, said in court that DiSarro’s family had a “right to feel like that, but they don’t know what’s going on, they don’t know the truth.”
Cause_General	The case harkened back to an era when organized crime in Boston was run by Salemme, who headed the New England family of La Cosa Nostra in the 1990s, and James “Whitey” Bulger, the gangster now serving life in prison whose crimes were depicted in the 2015 film “Black Mass.”
Distant_Evaluation	Prosecutors said Salemme had a secret interest in a music venue called The Channel that DiSarro purchased.
Distant_Evaluation	Stephen “The Rifleman” Flemmi, a longtime partner of Bulger’s who also knew Salemme, testified that Salemme became concerned DiSarro was speaking to authorities and might implicate him in criminal activities.
Distant_Evaluation	Flemmi, who is serving a life sentence for 10 murders, said he witnessed DiSarro’s strangling on May 10, 1993, when he went to Salemme’s home to talk to Salemme.
Distant_Evaluation	Flemmi said he saw Salemme’s now-deceased son, Frank Jr., strangling DiSarro as Weadick held his legs and the elder Salemme watched.
Distant_Evaluation	Flemmi, 84, said he quickly left, but added Salemme later told him DiSarro was killed and that his body was buried in Rhode Island.
Main	CHICAGO (Reuters) - The white Chicago policeman who shot a black teen 16 times in 2014 committed an act of unjustifiable murder, a prosecutor told jurors on Thursday, while the defense argued that the officer had seen the youngster carrying a knife and feared for his safety.
Distant_Evaluation	The trial has intensified a debate on race relations and police use of force in the third-largest U.S. city.
Cause_General	Jason Van Dyke, 40, is charged with first-degree murder, aggravated battery and official misconduct.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He is the first Chicago police officer to face a murder charge for an on-duty incident in decades and could be sentenced to life in prison if convicted.
Cause_General	Following the closing arguments, the jury deliberated for several hours on Thursday afternoon.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They will be sequestered at a hotel and will resume deliberating on Friday morning.
Cause_General	Jurors are permitted to consider a lesser charge of second-degree murder as an alternative.
Distant_Historical	The release of a video in 2015 that showed 17-year-old Laquan McDonald’s shooting sparked days of protest in Chicago, part of a wave of high-profile police killings of black men that has prompted a national conversation about race and policing.
Distant_Evaluation	The case will largely turn on whether jurors believe Van Dyke reasonably feared for his safety when he shot McDonald.
Cause_Specific	Prosecutor Jody Gleason told jurors on Thursday that an officer can only use deadly force “when it’s reasonable and necessary,” a standard that she said Van Dyke had fallen short of meeting.
Cause_Specific	“This case has been about exaggerating the threat and trying to hide behind the police shield,” Gleason said.
Cause_Specific	“Why?
Cause_Specific	Because there’s no justification for shooting Laquan McDonald that night.
Cause_Specific	Not one shot.
Cause_Specific	Not the first shot.
Cause_Specific	Not the 16th shot.”
Cause_Specific	Prosecutors say the video, taken from a dashboard camera and repeatedly shown to the jury, shows McDonald was not moving toward Van Dyke when he began firing and that he continued to shoot after McDonald fell to the ground.
Cause_Specific	But Van Dyke’s attorney Daniel Herbert argued that the video did not show the scene from Van Dyke’s perspective.
Cause_Specific	Van Dyke, he said, arrived as the “threat level” was rising and had been trained to continue shooting until the threat had ended.
Cause_Specific	“It’s a tragedy, but not a murder,” Herbert said.
Cause_Specific	“And it’s a tragedy that could have been prevented with one simple step.
Cause_Specific	At any point throughout that 20-some-minute rampage, had Laquan McDonald dropped that knife, he’d be here today.”
Cause_Specific	Van Dyke took the witness stand in his own defense on Tuesday, telling jurors he felt threatened because McDonald was advancing toward him at the time he began firing.

Cause_General	"Jose Ortiz, who went by the alias ""Buitre,"" has been in jail since July 2009 when federal agents detained him and another member of the organization in Oaxaca where the group operates."
Cause_General	They were being held on suspicion of kidnapping and other illegal acts.
Cause_General	The office of the Attorney General of Mexico (PGR) said the judge sentenced him on charges of organized crime, kidnapping and for carrying a firearm.
Cause_Specific	Officers with the deputy attorney general's office specializing in the investigation of organized crime, presented sufficient evidence during the trial to get the prison sentence in connection with the six kidnapping cases, the PGR said in a statement.
Cause_General	Ruben Raul Perez, the other person arrested at the same time as Ortiz, was sentenced to 77 years in prison on the same counts related to a single kidnapping.
Distant_Historical	In 2008, the federal police said that Ortiz and his people were allegedly responsible for the kidnapping of Claudio Conti, an Italian living in the seaside resort of Puerto Escondido.
Distant_Historical	The kidnapping occurred in June 2008.
Distant_Historical	With the capture of several accomplices in the months following Conti's kidnapping, it was revealed that Ortiz had ordered the killing of the 53-year-old Italian whose body was buried in a clandestine grave.
Distant_Historical	The Mexican government has attributed numerous violent episodes to the Zetas in the past decade, including the 2011 killing of 72 migrants from various countries who were crossing the Mexican state of Tamaulipas on their way to the U.S. border.

Main	CAPE TOWN, Sept. 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is among the countries that has the highest murder rate in the world, with 57 murders reported every day, Police Minister Bheki Cele said on Tuesday.
Main	Releasing his annual report on crime statistics in Parliament, Cele said 20,336 people were murdered in South Africa in the period from April 1, 2017 to April 31, 2018, up 6.9 percent from the 19,016 murders reported in the previous corresponding period.
Distant_Historical	Of these murdered victims, 3,915 were women and children, the statistics show.
Cause_General	Among the nine provinces, the Western Cape has the highest reported murder rate, to be followed by KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape.
Cause_General	Seven of the top 10 police stations for murder cases are in the Western Cape where gang-related crimes are high.
Distant_Historical	The province reported 808 gang-related murders in the period surveyed.
Distant_Historical	Firearms were used in almost half of all murders, to be followed by knives, sharp instruments and other unknown items.
Distant_Historical	Among other crimes, robbery of cash-in-transit vans also saw a sharp increase in the period surveyed, increasing by 86 counts, from 152 to 238, with most robberies happening on the roads and in business areas, and 40 in spaza shops and malls.
Distant_Historical	In most instances, security guards' weapons were taken from them.
Cause_General	Rape has increased by 0.5 percent, or by seven more people per day meaning that 109 people are raped every day in South Africa.
Cause_General	While residential burglaries have decreased by 7.5 percent, this still means that 625 homes are burgled every day in South Africa.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This situation must be reversed with lightning speed."
Distant_Evaluation	"The worst thing we can do is come and give the same or worse statistics next year,"" Cele said at a press conference after releasing the report."
Distant_Evaluation	"He said South Africans should not have to adapt to dangerous conditions or ""take it as a norm that when on the road, you must be hijacked, or when at home, someone must break in and terrorize you and your family""."
Distant_Evaluation	It looks as if that South Africans are living in a war zone, when there is peace and no war in the country, Cele said.
Distant_Evaluation	But Cele rejected the notion that the country has been plunged into a state of lawlessness.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We haven't reached a state of lawlessness in South Africa and we won't,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""I think our emphasis should be on what ought to be done rather than the crime statistics, which doesn't give any joy,"" the minister said."
Distant_Evaluation	In response to the report, the opposition Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) called for the reinstatement of capital punishment.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The deplorable state of crime in our country, particularly in regards to the murder rate is reason enough to get South Africans talking about the reinstatement of the capital punishment,"" said Narend Singh, a Member of Parliament from the IFP."
Distant_Evaluation	"Francois Beukman, Chairperson of Parliament's Portfolio Committee on Police said, ""What is quite important to note is that the murder increase of 6.9 percent is really alarming and totally unacceptable... violent crime is indeed a clear and present danger to all South Africans."""
Distant_Evaluation	"The Democratic Alliance (DA) said the government led by the African National Congress (ANC) ""is losing the battle to keep South Africans safe""."
Distant_Evaluation	"The DA attributed the high crime rates to the inability of the South African Police Service (SAPS) which it said ""is severely under-resourced, under-staffed, under-trained and under-equipped."""

Main	CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian police killed five terrorists of the so-called Hasm group in a shootout during a raid on their hideout in Qalioubiya province north of the capital Cairo, the Egyptian Interior Ministry said in a statement Tuesday.
Cause_Specific	The police said the militants were involved in carrying out several terrorist operations including the murder of a police officer and the assassination attempt of Alexandria security chief.
Cause_General	The five belong to the so-called Hasm group, which the police refer to as the armed wing of the currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, the police raided another hiding place in Cairo and arrested five Hasm members and seized a number of machine guns and shotguns in their possession, according to the statement.
Cause_General	In late June, the police killed four Hasm militants in a similar raid in Upper Egypt's province of Assiut, saying they were involved in a car bomb attack in March that killed two policemen in the northern province of Alexandria.
Cause_General	A day after the blast, which failed to harm Alexandria security chief, the police announced killing six of Hasm militants and said they were also involved in the terror operation.
Distant_Historical	Hasm appeared in late 2016 and claimed responsibility for a number of terrorist attacks that killed policemen in the country.
Cause_General	Terror activities in Egypt have killed hundreds of policemen, soldiers and civilians since the military toppled Morsi in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his Brotherhood group.
Cause_General	The Sinai-based branch of the Islamic State (IS) regional terrorist group claimed responsibility for most of the terror operations in Egypt over the past few years.
Cause_General	The Egyptian forces killed hundreds of terrorists and arrested thousands of suspects during the country's anti-terror war declared by President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, the army chief then, following Morsi's ouster.
Main	LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Rap mogul Marion “Suge” Knight pleaded no contest in a Los Angeles court on Thursday to a charge of manslaughter for a 2015 hit-and-run killing, accepting a 28-year prison sentence under a deal with prosecutors days before his murder trial was to begin.

Error	Gary Coronado/Los Angeles Times/Pool via REUTERS
Cause_General	In pleading no contest, equivalent to a guilty plea under California law, the 53-year-old co-founder of influential hip-hop label Death Row Records admitted using a “deadly and dangerous weapon” when he ran down two men with his pickup truck.
Cause_Specific	One of the victims, 55-year-old Terry Carter, later died of his injuries.
Cause_General	The second man, Cle “Bone” Sloan, was left with a badly mangled left foot and head injuries.
Distant_Historical	The deadly confrontation occurred on Jan. 29, 2015, outside a hamburger stand in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton, following a heated argument on the set of a commercial for the film “Straight Outta Compton.”
Distant_Historical	Knight, who was out on bail in a robbery case at the time, fled the scene but was later arrested.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Had Knight been convicted of murder and attempted murder as originally charged, he would have faced a mandatory sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Jury selection in the murder trial had been set to start on Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court.
Cause_General	As part of the agreement to plead no contest to a single count of voluntary manslaughter, all other charges in the case were dropped.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Two separate criminal cases in which he was charged with robbery and making criminal threats will also be dismissed when he is formally sentenced on Oct. 4, prosecutors said.
Distant_Evaluation	Knight’s lawyers previously contended he accidentally struck the two men with his vehicle while trying to flee what he thought was an ambush attempt.
Distant_Evaluation	But prosecutors said Knight traded punches with Sloan through the window of his truck before putting the vehicle into reverse, knocking Sloan and Carter to the ground, then pulling forward to run over both men.
Cause_General	The incident was captured on videotape by the restaurant’s surveillance cameras.
Cause_General	Knight, sporting a graying beard and wearing an orange jail uniform and dark-rimmed glasses, said little during Thursday’s proceedings, mostly giving one- or two-word answers to a series of procedural questions from Superior Court Judge Ronald Coen.
Distant_Evaluation	But at one point when asked by the judge if he understood his plea could lead to deportation were he not a U.S. citizen, Knight joked: “Is ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) gonna come and get me?”
Distant_Evaluation	Knight has long been known as much for his run-ins with the law and brushes with violence and as for his career as a rap music executive who promoted the likes of Snoop Dogg, Dr. Dre and Tupac Shakur in the 1990s.
Distant_Historical	Knight was sent to prison in October 1996 for violating probation on a previous assault case when he allegedly kicked a man during a scuffle at a Las Vegas hotel.
Distant_Historical	That scuffle in September 1996 took place hours before Shakur was shot to death in a drive-by attack while riding in a car with Knight after a Mike Tyson boxing match.
Distant_Historical	Knight, who was at the wheel, was slightly wounded himself.
Distant_Historical	Months later, rap artist Christopher Wallace, known as Notorious B.I.G.
Distant_Historical	and signed to a rival record label, was shot to death in Los Angeles.
Distant_Historical	Knight, who was incarcerated at the time, was named by police a few years later as a suspect in the Wallace slaying but was never charged.
Cause_General	Both rap murders remain unsolved.

Main	CHICAGO (Reuters) - The white Chicago police officer who shot to death a black teenager in 2014 told jurors at his murder trial on Tuesday that he felt threatened when he opened fire, as he took the witness stand in his own defense.
Error	Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke stands with his attorneys during his murder trial in the shooting death of Laquan McDonald, in Chicago, Illinois, October 3, 2018.
Error	REUTERS/John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/Pool via REUTERS
Cause_Specific	Jason Van Dyke, 40, is accused of shooting 17-year-old Laquan McDonald 16 times and faces charges of first-degree murder, aggravated battery and official misconduct in a case that has focused attention on race relations and policing in the third-largest U.S. city.
Cause_General	He is the first Chicago police officer to face a murder charge for an on-duty incident in decades.
Cause_General	His decision to testify was not revealed until he took the stand.
Main	Wiping tears away at times, Van Dyke testified that McDonald “never stopped” advancing toward him, getting about 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 meters) away.
Main	“His face had no expression,” Van Dyke said under questioning from his lawyer.
Main	“His eyes were buggin’ out.”
Main	McDonald waved his knife and was still holding the knife when he fell to the ground, Van Dyke testified, adding that he shot at the knife.
Main	Van Dyke said he did not know how many shots he fired at the time and stopped shooting when McDonald fell and when his gun was empty.
Main	“I’m yelling at him, ‘Drop that knife,’” Van Dyke said.
Main	“I just wanted him to get rid of that knife.”
Distant_Evaluation	Prosecutors have said Van Dyke was not justified in shooting McDonald.
Distant_Evaluation	Jurors have repeatedly viewed a video of the incident, which prosecutors have argued shows that McDonald was not moving toward Van Dyke at the time he began firing.
Cause_General	The public release of the dashboard camera video, which came after a journalist filed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, sparked days of protests in Chicago.
Main	Under cross-examination by a prosecutor, Van Dyke said that video and an animated video of the shooting played for the jury do not show what occurred from his point of view.
Main	“It’s not my perspective,” Van Dyke said.
Cause_General	The prosecution grilled Van Dyke on his actions in the moments before the shooting, and noted that the officer continued to shoot after McDonald fell to the ground.
Main	“I shot at that knife,” Van Dyke said.
Main	“My focus was just on that knife and I just wanted him to get rid of that knife.
Main	That’s all I could think.”
Main	“Cause to me it seemed like he was getting back up and he was in the fight,” Van Dyke said later.

Cause_General	Van Dyke’s lawyers have portrayed McDonald as an unruly, threatening criminal who was under the influence of a drug.
Main	Van Dyke also told jurors he had drawn his gun several times in his career, but had never fired it in the line of duty before the Oct. 20, 2014 incident.
Main	“I’m very proud of that,” he said.

Main	DAMASCUS, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- At least 40 civilians were killed on Saturday morning by intensified U.S.-led airstrikes in eastern Syria, state news agency SANA reported.
Main	The airstrikes targeted the village of al-Bukan near the town of Hajin, 110 km southeast of Deir al-Zour province in eastern Syria, said SANA.
Cause_General	The attack is part of incessant airstrikes targeting the last Islamic State (IS)-held pocket in the eastern countryside of Deir al-Zour.
Cause_General	"SANA said the village of Bukan has become almost empty as people started fleeing the U.S.-airstrikes, which are carrying out the ""scorched land"" tactic."
Cause_General	Over the past week, the U.S.-led strikes killed over 100 civilians, SANA added.
Main	Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the coalition airstrikes killed 43 civilians Saturday, including 29 children and women.
Cause_General	"The watchdog group said the ""massacre"" is the largest on the eastern bank of Euphrates River in eastern Deir al-Zour since the U.S.-backed operation against IS started over 10 weeks ago."
Cause_General	U.S.-led airstrikes on the last IS-held pocket on the eastern bank of Euphrates River have recently intensified as the U.S.-backed Kurdish militias were planning a second wave of attacks on the IS after a failed attempt on Sept. 10.
Cause_General	A day earlier, the observatory said the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces has amassed around 1,700 fighters over the past 24 hours as part of the preparation for another wave of attack on IS positions east of Euphrates.
Distant_Evaluation	"On Saturday, the Syrian Foreign Ministry renewed in a statement its call on the UN to form ""an independent international mechanism"" to investigate the ""crimes of the Washington coalition"" and punish the perpetrators."
Distant_Evaluation	The Syrian government has long questioned the intention of the U.S.-led operations in this oil-rich area inside Syria.
Main	BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovak authorities have identified a possible witness in the murder of Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak, whose killing last February led mass protests that forced the government to resign, a state prosecutor said on Monday.

Cause_General	It was the first development in the case in the six months since the murder.
Distant_Evaluation	“This person may have been present at or close to the crime scene around the time the crime was committed and may have information about the crime,” the prosecutor overseeing the case told a news conference.
Cause_General	He declined to answer questions on whether that person was a suspect or just a witness.
Cause_Specific	Kuciak, who had written about political corruption in Slovakia, was found shot dead along with his fiancee Martina Kusnirova at their home outside Bratislava in February.
Cause_General	They were both 27.
Cause_General	The murder - which police have called a professional hit - raised fears over media freedom in ex-communist Eastern Europe, and led to mass protests across the nation that forced the departure of previous police chief Tibor Gaspar as well as Prime Minister Robert Fico and interior minister Robert Kalinak.
Cause_General	The cabinet was reshuffled with Fico’s deputy Peter Pellegrini taking over as prime minister but the three-party center-left coalition stayed in power.
Distant_Evaluation	The prosecutor, who declined to give his name, said authorities had also whittled down possible motives to two.
Cause_General	He held up a sketch of the possible witness depicting a white man with a beard and dark hair who appeared to be in his late 20s to early 30s.
Cause_General	He provided no other details.
Distant_Evaluation	“Despite initial mistakes in investigation, we have narrowed down possible motives from 30 to two,” the prosecutor said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I believe we will be successful in the end.”
Cause_General	The update on Monday came after more than 300 Slovak journalists and publishers last month criticized police for the lack of progress in the murder investigation and alleged corruption described by Kuciak.
Distant_Evaluation	“As no fundamental changes to the police or to the prosecutorial bodies have taken place, we have doubts about the independence of the investigation,” they said in a statement.
Cause_General	Kuciak had covered Slovak businessmen mentioned in the Panama Papers and also probed fraud cases involving businessmen with Slovak political ties.
Cause_General	He had also been looking into suspected mafia links of Italians with businesses in Slovakia.
Main	An American government report on the killing of 24 Iraqis, including several women and children, by marines in the village of Haditha in 2005 provides new details of how the shootings unfolded and supports allegations by prosecutors that a few marines illegally killed civilians, government officials said yesterday.
Main	The report, by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, contains thousands of pages of interviews with marines, Iraqi Army soldiers who had accompanied them and Iraqi villagers who had seen the attack.
Cause_Specific	The shootings followed a roadside bombing that killed a lance corporal and wounded two other marines, said a senior Defense Department official and another official who had read the report.
Main_Consequence	The evidence contained in the report, the most exhaustive of several inquiries begun by the military last year to determine what had happened in Haditha that day, led prosecutors to charge four enlisted marines with murder.
Main_Consequence	Four marine officers, who were not present during the attack, were charged with dereliction of duty and other crimes for failing to properly report details of the episode.
Cause_General	The details of the investigation, first reported by The Washington Post yesterday, corroborate accounts of how the killings took place over a period of hours, as described by senior military and Defense Department officials last year in The New York Times.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But the report broadly expands on those descriptions, and provides additional evidence, sworn testimony and accounts of witnesses that both prosecutors and lawyers for the accused marines are likely to use in upcoming courts-martial, officials said.
Main_Consequence	The four enlisted men charged with unpremeditated murder, all members of a squad of Company K, Third Battalion, First Marines, are Staff Sgt.
Main_Consequence	Frank D. Wuterich of Meriden, Conn.; Sgt.
Main_Consequence	Sanick P. Dela Cruz, 24, of Chicago; Lance Cpl.
Main_Consequence	Justin L. Sharratt, 22, of Carbondale, Pa.; and Lance Cpl.
Main_Consequence	Stephen B. Tatum, 25, of Edmond, Okla.
Cause_Specific	The attack on the Iraqis began after the roadside bomb blew up one of four Humvees the marines were traveling in on Nov. 19, 2005.
Main	The report portrays Sergeant Wuterich, the squad leader, and Sergeant Dela Cruz as minutes later killing five men who had nervously piled out of a taxi that had stopped near the marine convoy, the officials said.
Main	The men ''were shot by Wuterich as they stood, unarmed, next to the vehicle approximately 10 feet in front of him,'' the report said, according to a person who has read it.
Main	Sergeant Dela Cruz said that as he approached the taxi, he saw some men standing near it with their hands in the air, officials said.
Main	After Sergeant Wuterich shot them, he continued shooting as they lay on the ground, and later urinated on one of them, an official said.
Main	The marines, taking small arms fire from several locations near homes on either side of the convoy, attacked a home nearby, killing six people, including a young boy, a woman and two elderly people, none of them armed, the report said, according to officials and people who have read it.
Main	The report said that marines had told investigators who interviewed them months later that they believed they had permission from their superiors to fire at will inside that home and a second home they raided minutes later, officials said.
Main	They said an officer, First Lt. William T. Kallop, who arrived with other marines after the roadside bomb to support the squad under fire, told them to commandeer one of the homes.
Main	In one of the houses the marines raided, the report said, a 13-year-old girl, Safah Yunis Salem, said she had survived by pretending to be dead after marines killed several family members, including her 3-year-old sister and 5-year-old brother, government officials said.
Distant_Evaluation	One person who has read the N.C.I.S.
Distant_Evaluation	report and who is sympathetic to the marines' account of events said that the report's thousands of pages provide evidence for both prosecution and defense teams, and that drawing conclusions from the report about the guilt of any of the marines is difficult.
Distant_Evaluation	''For every statement that said X happened, there's another statement that said Y happened,'' this person said, speaking only after being granted anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the report.
Distant_Evaluation	An N.C.I.S.
Distant_Evaluation	spokesman declined to comment on the report, which it has not officially released, and said the agency was troubled by the leak of it to The Post.
Distant_Evaluation	''N.C.I.S.
Distant_Evaluation	strives to ensure the integrity of every investigation and finds the idea that someone might leak any of its investigative products to be deeply troubling,'' the spokesman said.
Distant_Evaluation	Several lawyers representing the marines expressed anger at the Defense Department, which they said had allowed the report to be given surreptitiously to a newspaper, potentially damaging their clients' cases.
Distant_Evaluation	''The defense lawyers are extremely upset,'' said Mark Zaid, a lawyer for Sergeant Wuterich, the squad leader who is charged with killing at least a dozen Iraqis.
Distant_Evaluation	''The release of the entire evidentiary set is unethical and appears to have been done by certain Pentagon officials with the intent to harm the defendants' defense.''
Main	The report offers some contradictory evidence and omits other issues about how the marine chain of command handled the aftermath of the attack that have rankled certain people within the military and Defense Department.
Distant_Evaluation	One issue is the cash payments that commanders approved for families of people killed in the attacks.
Distant_Evaluation	Maj. Gen. Richard A. Huck, the commander of the Second Marine Division at the time, and Col. Stephen W. Davis, then the regimental commander, should have suspected the killings were improper, one Defense Department official said yesterday.
Cause_General	Though the Marine Corps' official view of the Haditha matter remained that 15 Iraqis had been killed by the roadside bomb, the corps nonetheless approved $2,500 for each of at least 15 families of people killed in the episode.
Distant_Evaluation	''The numbers simply never added up, and the Marines never acknowledged it,'' the Defense Department official said.

Main	QUITO, April 17 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador on Tuesday reported the second kidnapping in less than a month along its border with Colombia, following the killings of three other abductees last week.
Cause_Specific	The latest victims were identified as an Ecuadorian couple abducted by the Oliver Sinisterra front, the same dissident guerrilla group that was behind the previous kidnapping, Ecuadorian Defense Minister Patricio Zambrano said.
Cause_General	"""The information we have... is that they are Ecuadorians from a province close to Esmeraldas,"" Zambrano said in a televised address."
Distant_Evaluation	"In response to rumors the pair may be members of the military, Zambrano said ""we don't have information that they are agents."""
Cause_General	"The dissident group, which broke away from Colombia's Revolutionary Armed Force (FARC) after it signed a peace deal with the government, is headed by Walter Patricio Arizala, also known as ""Guacho,"" who ordered the capture and killing of a press team from Ecuador's El Comercio daily."
Distant_Evaluation	The abduction of the two journalists and their driver shocked the nation.
Cause_General	They were apparently preparing a report on violence and crime in the border region when the rebels seized them in a bid to negotiate an exchange for three of their own who were in custody.
Cause_General	Last week, Ecuador's President Lenin Moreno traveled to Lima, Peru for a summit, only to turn around and come back after learning the killings of the three.
Cause_General	According to Ecuador's Interior Minister Cesar Navas, the rebels sent a proof of life video of the kidnapped couple to the government on Monday night via the social networking app Whatsapp.
Cause_General	"""It's the first time that 'Guacho' sends proof of life directly to us through a communications channel, not like on prior occasions when he did it through Colombian media outlets,"" said Navas, calling the rebels ""drug traffickers."""
Cause_General	"In the video, ""the drug traffickers request through their kidnap victims that their demands be met,"" he said."
Cause_General	The footage shows a man and a woman standing and facing a camera, their hands tied, as an armed rebel wearing a hooded mask stands guard on each side.
Cause_General	In the video, the bound couple ask Ecuador's president to comply with their captors' demands so they do not meet the same fate as the journalists.
Cause_Specific	The victims, identified by the government as Oscar Efren Villacis Gomez and Katty Vanesa Velasco Pinargote, are believed to be abducted late Wednesday or early Thursday in the town of San Lorenzo, Esmeraldas.
Cause_General	"Moreno called an emergency meeting of his Public Security Committee to decide ""how to proceed given this new threat,"" said Navas."
Cause_General	The dissident rebels are looking to ship their drugs out of Ecuador via the Mataje River, which divides the two countries, said the minister.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Ecuador will resort to ""all the military pressure needed to bring peace again to the border area."
Distant_Evaluation	"Ecuador's peace is not to be negotiated with killers,"" he said."

Main	ANKARA, Oct. 1 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's nationalist party has been urging its election ally ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) for an amnesty that will pardon more than 160,000 prisoners including a notorious mafia leader.
Cause_General	According to party officials, the amnesty covers crimes committed before May 19 and will be subject to one-off 5 years conditional reduced sentence, thus paving the way for the release of 162,989 people.
Distant_Historical	The idea of an amnesty first came to public attention in May, ahead of June 24 Turkish parliament elections, as part of the election campaign of the Nationalist Movement Party (MHP).
Distant_Historical	The nationalist party's leader Devlet Bahceli paid a visit in May to Alaattin Cakici, a ringleader of the Turkish underworld, after Cakici was taken from prison, where he is serving his time, to a hospital after the general amnesty was suggested.
Distant_Historical	The kingpin was convicted of several crimes including leading a crime syndicate to gain profit and instigate murder.
Cause_General	Cakici is affiliated with nationalist circles and was first arrested after the 1980 coup which tried to link the murder of 41 people to the MHP and a number of nationalist organizations.
Distant_Evaluation	Local media said he had been working for Turkey's National Intelligence Organization abroad at the time.
Distant_Evaluation	"Bahceli openly advocated ultra-nationalist Cakici's release, calling him a ""hero."""
Cause_General	On May 13, Erdogan turned down the amnesty request although both parties were in an alliance for June 24 parliament and presidential elections.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The MHP said the current bill will relieve pressure on overcrowded jails and release those imprisoned by politically-influenced judges.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The physical conditions of prisons are pretty insufficient."
Distant_Evaluation	Occupancy rates are causing violation of human rights for people there.
Cause_General	"The capacity of 449 prisons is 211,274,"" the MHP deputy chair Feti Yildiz said."
Distant_Evaluation	As of Sept. 21, 253,535 people were recorded to have be imprisoned, Yildiz said, adding that the health of prisoners deteriorates and it becomes harder to live with dignity and self-respect.
Cause_Specific	The nationalist party has recently mounted its calls for a general pardon since the ruling AKP and MHP are approaching another possible alliance in upcoming local elections scheduled for March 2019.
Distant_Evaluation	Turkey's president and the ruling party leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan are not keen on amnesty, but did not ruled out a pardon to prisoners as the two parties are on the eve of alliance talks.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Erdogan said on Sept. 23 that their principle was to grant amnesty only to convicts who committed crimes against the state, and crimes against individuals are not covered.
Distant_Evaluation	The AKP cannot ignore a proposal by an ally party in the election, AKP's Deputy Chairman Hayati Yazici said last week.
Distant_Evaluation	"He noted that the bill should be carefully evaluated ""without any ulterior motives, taking into account its effects on the society, the fight against crime, the judiciary and the perception of justice."""
Distant_Evaluation	The AKP is not enthusiastic with the amnesty proposal but the ruling party does not want to harm the possible alliance, said Emine Kaplan, a journalist covering parliament affairs at daily Cumhuriyet.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, Bahri Ozturk, dean of Istanbul Culture University Faculty of Law, warns that a general pardon will undermine the authority of law and cause long-term problems within society, as this will be a political decision made from populist ideas rather than legal reasons.
Distant_Evaluation	"""An amnesty has never been a solution to problems in Turkey."
Distant_Evaluation	"Those released were convicted again over similar charges after previous amnesties in the country,"" he noted."

Cause_Specific	The news was confirmed by a lawyer for the family of Kuciak, whose killing seven months ago rocked the central European country, stoking anger over public corruption and sparking the biggest street protests since the fall of communism in 1989.
Main	“In the early morning hours today police detained suspects in the premeditated murder of Jan Kuciak and (his fiancee) Martina Kusnirova,” lawyer Daniel Lipsic said on Facebook.
Cause_General	He told Reuters by text message that he had been briefed by prosecutors.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Lipsic later told the website of daily newspaper SME that he was convinced there was enough evidence to justify keeping the suspects in custody.
Cause_General	Local media reported that eight people were being held.
Cause_General	Reuters could not immediately verify that number.
Main	The police said earlier on its Facebook page it had detained persons suspected of a violent crime and was carrying out home searches but did not say in which case.
Cause_General	A spokesman declined to comment further.
Cause_Specific	Media, including SME and Aktuality.sk, where Kuciak had worked, reported police were carrying out home searches in the south of the country.
Cause_General	Kuciak had, among other things, investigated fraud cases involving businessmen with Slovak political ties.
Cause_General	He had also looked into suspected mafia links between Italy and businesses in Slovakia.
Distant_Historical	Kuciak was found shot dead along with Kusnirova at their home outside Bratislava in February.
Cause_General	They were both 27.
Cause_General	In his final story, published posthumously, he reported on an Italian living in Slovakia with past business links to two Slovaks who later worked in then-prime minister Robert Fico’s office.
Distant_Evaluation	Both of the Slovaks resigned but deny connections to the murder.
Distant_Historical	Their Italian former business partner has also denied having connections with the mafia and the murder but was detained on a European drug trafficking warrant in March and extradited to Italy in May.

Distant_Historical	Weeks of public protests in March eventually forced the departure of long-serving leader Fico and his interior minister Robert Kalinak, as well as police chief Tibor Gaspar.
Cause_General	However, Fico’s three-party government coalition has remained in power under Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini, who comes from the ruling Smer party which Fico still leads.
Distant_Evaluation	Pellegrini welcomed news of the detentions in a social media post on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	A spokeswoman said the prime minister had no official information on the police action.
Distant_Evaluation	“The investigation and punishment of those guilty of this murder is one of the priorities of my government,” Pellegrini wrote.
Cause_General	The investigation is the biggest in the country’s history.
Cause_General	Interior Minister Denisa Sakova said on Thursday investigators had interviewed more than 200 people.

Distant_Historical	A prosecutor said in March the murder was likely to have been a contract killing related to Kuciak’s work.
Cause_General	Police released this month a sketch of a possible witness and said they had narrowed down possible motives to two.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While demonstrations are no longer being held regularly in the country of 5.4 million, organisers of the protests that numbered in the tens of thousands in March and April have vowed to keep up pressure on the government and to ensure a thorough investigation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They said on Thursday that while they welcomed progress in the case, they would still hold an anti-government rally in Bratislava on Friday.
Main	BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - A Slovak court on Sunday ordered four people jailed until their trial for the murder of investigative reporter Jan Kuciak and his fiancee, a state prosecutor said.

Cause_Specific	The February killings sparked nationwide protests that toppled the government of Robert Fico, who had run Slovakia for all but two of the past 12 years.
Cause_Specific	Three suspects were detained in a house raid on Thursday morning and charged with murder on Friday.
Cause_Specific	The fourth suspect, a woman detained separately on Friday, has been charged with participating in the murder, which may have included helping, planning, ordering or organising the killing, Kuciak family’s lawyer Daniel Lipsic told Reuters.
Cause_General	Authorities released no further details on the four suspects and it is not yet clear when the trial might take place.
Cause_General	Kuciak had, among other things, investigated fraud involving businessmen with Slovak political ties, and the suspected mafia links of Italians with businesses in Slovakia.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Her visit will increase pressure on the EU member after the European Parliament expressed “serious concerns” about police independence and international money-laundering on the island in a resolution adopted last year..
Distant_Historical	The resolution was adopted after Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, an anti-corruption campaigner, was killed in October by a car bomb.
Error	(reut.rs/2EYpxlB)
Main	Commissioner Vera Jourova said she planned to go to Malta by June to discuss “several” open issues with the authorities.
Cause_Specific	Her decision came as a group of local and international media groups, including Reuters, began following up stories covered by Caruana Galizia, in an initiative called the Daphne Project.
Cause_General	Malta, together with other EU states, faces a sanction procedure for its delay in adopting new EU rules against money laundering.
Main	Jourova said she wanted to address this issue in her forthcoming visit and also the strengthening of the Maltese agency to tackle money laundering, the Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit.
Distant_Evaluation	“I of course want to inquiry about the state of play in the investigation on the murder of Madame Galizia,” Jourova told a new conference in Brussels.
Cause_General	Three people have been so far charged for the execution of the murder but police have not yet identified who ordered the killing.
Distant_Evaluation	“This investigation is not just about bringing to justice the people who have actually made the bomb, and made the explosion that killed Daphne.
Distant_Evaluation	This is also about uncovering who gave the order to do that,” the commission’s vice president Frans Timmermans said, speaking at the same news conference with Jourova.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We will keep pushing the Maltese authorities,” he said.
Main	Jourova also said she will discuss Malta’s program to sell citizenship to wealthy individuals.
Cause_General	Timmermans insisted that EU passports can be sold only to individuals who have a clear, “demonstrable” link to an European Union country.
Distant_Evaluation	“This is a question that, I think, can be raised with the Maltese authorities when discussing the passport scheme,” he said.
Distant_Historical	The Commission forced Malta in 2014 to amend its scheme so that only people who had effectively resided on the island for at least 12 months could obtain citizenship, but the country has since allowed foreigners to buy passports with laxer requirements, the Daphne Project consortium found.
Main	DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Five more suspects were charged in a Tanzanian court on Friday for the murder of prominent conservationist Wayne Lotter, bringing to eight the total number of people arraigned over the killing.
Distant_Historical	Three other suspects were charged for the same crime in October last year.

Main	AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - The Dallas Police Department on Monday fired a police officer who is facing a manslaughter charge after fatally shooting a man in his apartment that the officer said she mistook for her own home.
Main	Officer Amber Guyger had been dismissed after nearly five years on the job for her actions on the night of the shooting earlier in September, Dallas Police Chief U. Renee Hall said in a statement.

Error	REUTERS/Osman Orsal
Main	ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities believe that prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who disappeared four days ago after entering Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul, was killed inside the consulate, two Turkish sources said on Saturday.
Main	“The initial assessment of the Turkish police is that Mr. Khashoggi has been killed at the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul.
Main	We believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate,” one Turkish official told Reuters.
Cause_General	The sources did not say how they believed the killing was carried out.
Cause_General	Saudi Arabia’s consul-general told Reuters on Saturday his country was helping search for Khashoggi, and dismissed talk of his possible abduction.
Cause_Specific	Khashoggi, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Washington for the past year fearing retribution for his critical views on Saudi policies, entered the consulate on Tuesday to secure documentation for his forthcoming marriage, according to his fiancee, who waited outside.
Cause_Specific	He has not been heard of since.
Distant_Evaluation	Since then, Turkish and Saudi officials have offered conflicting accounts of his disappearance, with Ankara saying there was no evidence that he had left the diplomatic mission and Riyadh saying he exited the premises the same day.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Earlier on Saturday Turkish officials said prosecutors had begun investigating Khashoggi’s disappearance and a spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan’s AK Party said authorities would uncover his whereabouts.
Main	After some of the heaviest fighting in two years in tribal areas bordering Afghanistan, Pakistan's generals are claiming initial success in their latest efforts to combat foreign militants and regain some control in one of the most lawless regions.
Cause_Specific	President Pervez Musharraf acknowledged Thursday for the first time that the Pakistani military had been involved in the recent heavy fighting in the tribal area of South Waziristan and said that nearly 300 foreign militants had been killed.
Cause_Specific	The commander of Pakistani troops in the tribal areas, Maj. Gen. Gul Muhammad, put the figure much lower, at 150 to 200, in a briefing for journalists in Wana, the main town of South Waziristan, on Wednesday.
Cause_Specific	By some estimates only dozens have been killed.
Cause_General	Foreign journalists are not permitted to visit the tribal areas, except a few selected ones under strictly controlled visits, and there has been no independent verification of casualty figures.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The military does appear to have gained more control in the immediate region of Wana, and General Muhammad said the progress made in clearing the area of foreign militants -- mainly Uzbeks and other Central Asians who have been allied with Al Qaeda -- would serve as a model to use in the rest of the region, including the equally lawless North Waziristan next door.
Cause_Specific	Pakistan has been under heavy pressure from the United States and NATO countries to contain the spreading lawlessness of its tribal areas which Pakistani, Afghan and foreign militants have been using to wage an expanding insurgency across the border in Afghanistan.
Cause_General	South Waziristan had become a Taliban state in all but name after a peace deal with militants in 2005 gave them freedom to operate while the military withdrew to its barracks.
Cause_General	The Pakistani military abandoned broad-scale military operations in favor of negotiated peace deals with the militants over the past two years.
Cause_General	The strategy has been criticized for allowing militants a haven to regroup and increase their attacks across the border in Afghanistan and possibly farther afield.
Cause_General	The military has now set upon a third way to tackle the problem of militancy in its tribal regions, backing local armed tribesmen who have turned against the foreigners and their local protectors.
Distant_Historical	A rift emerged between a local commander and Uzbek fighters in his region in November and the military, and intelligence agencies admit they have sought to exploit the growing animosity among the local tribespeople toward the foreign militants, whom they accused of thuggery, robberies and murders.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's indigenous and it's picking up momentum,'' General Muhammad said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's a homegrown affair.''
Distant_Evaluation	In a speech at a military conference in Islamabad on Thursday, President Musharraf said: ''The people of South Waziristan now have risen against the foreigners.
Cause_Specific	They have killed about 300 of them, and they got support from the Pakistan Army.
Distant_Evaluation	They asked for support.''
Cause_Specific	Military and paramilitary forces have moved in and occupied strategic hilltops and ridges in several areas that were until now controlled by militants in Shin Warsak, Kalosha and Tora Gola, General Muhammad said.
Cause_General	The immediate Wana region was almost clear of Uzbek militants, and tribal volunteers were chasing them in Nandran, a mountainous area near the Afghan border.
Distant_Evaluation	Even as it explains the recent developments as a homegrown uprising, the government is claiming credit for the shift in tribal dynamics as a result of its three-pronged strategy, referred to by General Muhammad as coercive deployment, political engagement and socio-economic development, to ''win over the hearts and minds of the people.''
Distant_Evaluation	Yet it remains unclear whether all is as the military says.
Cause_General	Promised meetings with members of the political administration of South Waziristan and with tribal elders did not materialize on the journalists' visit to the region Wednesday.
Cause_General	And while the military has tried to depict the fighting as local tribespeople moving against the foreigners, in fact it has been led by a Pakistani Taliban commander, Maulavi Nazir, who has close links to the Afghan Taliban and Arab members of Al Qaeda.
Distant_Evaluation	One of his accusations against the Uzbek group of militants has been that they did not want to fight foreign troops in Afghanistan, but preferred to attack pro-American Pakistanis, whether tribal elders or government members.
Distant_Evaluation	Answering a volley of questions regarding Mr. Nazir, General Muhammad said only that the militant commander was subservient to his tribe and not above it.
Distant_Evaluation	Hundreds of foreign militants remain in the region, probably including the leaders of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al- Zawahri, officials admit.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''It will take time,'' the general said.
Distant_Evaluation	''There are no quick fixes in this war.
Distant_Evaluation	We are here for a long haul.''

Cause_General	Municipal lawmaker Fernando Alban, 56, was jailed last Friday for alleged involvement in the explosion of two drones during a military parade in August that was led by President Nicolas Maduro, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said.
Cause_Specific	“At the moment he was going to be transported to court, while he was in the SEBIN waiting room, he jumped from the window of the building and fell, causing his death,” Reverol wrote in a post on Twitter.
Cause_Specific	That account differed from the one by Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab, who said in televised statements that Alban had asked to use a bathroom and jumped from there.
Cause_Specific	The opposition First Justice party, for which Alban was a Caracas municipal counselor, said he was murdered.
Cause_Specific	“With great pain and thirst for justice we tell the people of Venezuela ... that Councilman Fernando Alban was murdered at the hands of the regime of Nicolas Maduro,” the party said.
Cause_Specific	First Justice’s national coordinator, Julio Borges, said Alban’s lifeless body was thrown from the SEBIN’s headquarters on Caracas’ Plaza Venezuela.
Cause_Specific	He did not provide any evidence and did he say what led him to believe that Alban was killed.
Distant_Evaluation	The party said that Alban’s arrest was owing to statements he made at recent United Nations meetings in New York City denouncing humans rights violations in Venezuela.
Cause_General	The government had previously given no reason for his arrest.
Cause_General	On Monday, Reverol said Alban had also been investigated for “destabilizing activities directed from abroad.”
Main_Consequence	The chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Bob Corker, called on Maduro to explain the reasons for Alban’s death.
Cause_General	Corker was in Caracas on Monday to meet with government officials and the opposition to assess Venezuela’s economic crisis.
Distant_Evaluation	“This is disturbing and the government has a responsibility to ensure all understand how that could have happened,” Corker, a Republican, said on Twitter.
Cause_General	The United States imposed new sanctions on several of Maduro’s top allies last week as President Donald Trump urged UN members to support a “restoration of democracy” in Venezuela.
Distant_Evaluation	Alban’s assistant, Mileidy Blanco, said she had begged him to leave Venezuela with his family.
Distant_Evaluation	“And he didn’t do it.
Distant_Evaluation	He loved the country too much,” she said in an interview outside the SEBIN’s headquarters, known as “The Tomb” for its underground detention facility.
Cause_Specific	The opposition and rights groups have said that Maduro’s administration is holding hundreds of political prisoners on trumped-up charges intended to stifle dissent.
Distant_Evaluation	The United Nations has said detainees are often subjected to ill treatment, including some documented cases that amount to torture.
Cause_General	Authorities have arrested at least 30 people linked to the drone explosions on Aug. 2, which injured seven soldiers.
Cause_Specific	The government has denied that it is detaining people as political prisoners and has said that they were fairly jailed.

Cause_Specific	Christhian Rivera, 24, was arrested and charged on Monday with the murder of 20-year-old Tibbetts, who disappeared in July while out jogging.
Cause_General	A woman’s body has been found but has not yet been positively identified, authorities have said.
Distant_Evaluation	Law enforcement officials told reporters on Monday that Rivera was Mexican and in the country illegally.
Distant_Evaluation	However, his defense lawyer said in a court filing on Wednesday that Rivera had legal status.
Main	Trump, who has taken a tough stance on immigration and referred to some Mexican migrants as criminals and rapists in his 2016 election campaign, made a reference to the Tibbetts case at a rally in West Virginia on Tuesday.
Main	“Should never have happened,” said Trump.
Main	“The immigration laws are such a disgrace.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The political fallout from the killing could reverberate across Iowa, a swing state that has a hotly contested gubernatorial race and where Democrats see a chance at taking two of the 23 seats they need to win back from Republicans in November’s midterms to gain a majority in the House of Representatives.
Distant_Evaluation	Iowa Republican Governor Kim Reynolds echoed Trump’s approach, blaming Tibbetts’ death on the nation’s immigration laws.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We are angry that a broken immigration system allowed a predator like this to live in our community, and we will do all we can bring justice to Mollie’s killer,” she said in a Tuesday statement.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But Republican members of Congress and congressional candidates in closely competitive Iowa districts were more guarded, perhaps wary of voter backlash if they politicized the case.
Distant_Evaluation	Republican lawmakers Rod Blum and David Young each issued statements expressing sympathy for the Tibbetts’ family but avoided any mention of illegal immigration.
Distant_Evaluation	Christopher Peters, a Republican mounting a long-shot challenge to Iowa Democratic Congressman Dave Loebsack, said on Facebook that politicizing Tibbetts’ murder “cheapens the death of this young woman.”
Distant_Evaluation	“Yes, our immigration system is broken, and Congress has failed to fix it,” Peters wrote.
Distant_Evaluation	“There is much we can and must do.
Distant_Evaluation	For now, though, we should mourn the loss of Mollie.”
Cause_General	Tibbetts’ father, who made many public pleas for information about his daughter’s whereabouts, could not be reached for comment on Wednesday.
Cause_General	A man who picked up the phone at the home of Tibbetts’ mother in Iowa declined to comment.
Distant_Historical	During his 2016 campaign, Trump spoke almost daily about the 2015 death of Kate Steinle, who was struck by a bullet that ricocheted off the ground after being accidentally fired by an illegal immigrant.
Distant_Historical	A jury last year cleared the immigrant of murder and manslaughter charges, and Trump railed against the decision.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Iowa voters might recoil at Tibbetts’ death being politicized so quickly, said Timothy Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa.
Distant_Evaluation	“Kate Steinle was used nationally by Republicans as an example of a system that needs fixing,” Hagle said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“That might happen again, but I’m not sure it will be handled the same way in Iowa.”

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I’m glad that the alleged perpetrator wanted by German authorities is back in Germany,” Seehofer said in a statement, adding that the investigation of the case could now be accelerated.
Distant_Evaluation	“For the girl’s family, that is only a small consolation, and my thoughts are with them during these difficult hours,” Seehofer said.
Distant_Evaluation	“But for the state and our society, it is important that crimes are cleared up and suspects are brought to justice.”
Cause_Specific	Police in the Kurdistan region of Iraq said on Saturday the Iraqi suspect had admitted to the murder of 14-year-old Susanna Feldman in Germany, where the case has stoked the immigration debate.
Cause_Specific	The Jewish teenager from Mainz near Frankfurt was found dead on Wednesday in a wooded area in Wiesbaden, near a refugee center where the alleged attacker had lived, German police said.
Cause_Specific	An autopsy showed she had been the victim of a violent and sexual attack.
Distant_Evaluation	Police said there was no evidence her religion had been a factor and the Central Council of Jews in Germany cautioned against attributing any anti-Semitic motive.
Cause_Specific	Kurdish security forces had taken the suspect, identified by German authorities as Ali Bashar, into custody on Friday after he fled from Germany last week.
Cause_General	“Officers in Zakho (in Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region) called me and said they had located the suspect and would arrest him as soon as he comes to the city,” Dohuk city police chief Tariq Ahmed told Reuters.
Cause_General	“He had been staying at a hotel in Dohuk and after realizing the police were after him left for Zakho to stay at a relative’s house.
Cause_Specific	He was asleep there at night and was arrested in that house at 5:30 (a.m.),” Ahmed said.
Cause_Specific	He said the suspect had confessed to killing the German teenager during interrogation by Kurdish security authorities.
Distant_Evaluation	INCREDIBLE SUFFERING
Cause_General	German media reported earlier that Bashar was expected to be extradited to Germany on Saturday evening and questioned by German investigators on Sunday.
Cause_General	German federal police declined to comment on the details emerging from the suspect’s arrest or on the report on the timing of extradition.
Distant_Evaluation	Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed her dismay at the crime and said it should be a reminder to Germans of the need to do whatever possible for the integration of immigrants.

Distant_Evaluation	“The cooperation in this regard between German and Kurdish security authorities worked well here ...
Distant_Evaluation	It is good that the alleged perpetrator was caught, that he probably also will be returning to Germany,” Merkel said.
Distant_Evaluation	She added, “This is a reminder to all of us, first, to take the task of integration very seriously, to make our common values very clear, again and again.
Distant_Evaluation	But also to punish any crime.
Distant_Evaluation	We can only live together if we all stick to our laws.”

Cause_General	Merkel’s decision to take in large numbers of asylum seekers during Europe’s 2015 migrant crisis has stirred a political backlash, with many politicians calling for new rules to make it easier to deport immigrants.
Cause_General	Bashar had been living in Germany as a refugee since 2015, German media have reported.
Cause_General	German police set up a special call center for tips from the public and issued releases in Arabic and Turkish.

Main	AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A Texas man who survived a deadly domestic attack hatched by his son is pushing the state to grant clemency to the condemned man, although it has never spared a death row inmate solely at the formal request of the victim’s family.
Cause_Specific	Thomas “Bart” Whitaker is set to be put to death by lethal injection on Feb. 22 for masterminding a 2003 plot near Houston that left his mother Tricia, 51, and brother Kevin, 19, dead and his father Kent with a bullet wound near his heart.
Cause_General	In the 31 states with capital punishment, district attorneys make the decision whether to seek death, balancing the punishment that they consider best serves society with the wishes of the victim’s family.
Distant_Historical	In this case, the local Texas prosecutors pursued death and jurors decided Bart Whitaker, 38, deserved to be executed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	His father, a 69-year-old devout Christian and retired executive, says if that penalty is implemented, it will only intensify his pain.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I am going to be thrown into a deeper grief at the hands of the state of Texas, in the name of justice,” Kent Whitaker said last week, after a 30-minute meeting with the chairman of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles in Austin.
Distant_Evaluation	Whitaker says his son has been a model inmate and has provided letters from death row prison guards to back him up.
Distant_Evaluation	According to the clemency petition, Kent Whitaker, his relatives and his wife’s family do not want Texas to execute Bart.
Cause_General	The panel’s decision is due on Tuesday, two days before the execution.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If it recommends commuting the death sentence to life in prison, Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, would make the final decision.
Distant_Evaluation	Tim Cole, an assistant professor of law at the University of North Texas Dallas College of Law and a former Texas district attorney, said the case points to a major flaw in the U.S. capital punishment system.
Distant_Evaluation	With no consistent criteria for prosecutors on whether they should seek execution, he said, the system is arbitrary.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is completely up to that one person, the district attorney, to seek death or not,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	The Whitaker case is an outlier, however.
Distant_Evaluation	In many cases, family members want the district attorney to seek the maximum punishment, Cole said.
Distant_Evaluation	Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976, clemency at the request of a forgiving victim’s family has been almost unheard of, according to the non-profit Death Penalty Information Center, which monitors U.S. capital punishment.
Distant_Historical	It did happen in Georgia in 1990, the group said.
Distant_Evaluation	It is far more common for courts to halt executions for reasons ranging from doubts over guilt to procedural problems with prosecutions than it is for a governor to grant clemency.
Distant_Evaluation	Money may have motivated Bart Whitaker to plan to murder his family with the help of two other men, court documents showed.
Distant_Historical	One of those men, his roommate Chris Brashear, shot the father, mother and brother after the family returned from a dinner out.
Distant_Historical	He shot Bart in the bicep to make it look he had also been attacked, court documents said.
Distant_Historical	The two other men helped prosecutors pin the crime on Whitaker and were not sentenced to death.
Distant_Evaluation	Local prosecutors said they considered the family’s views but stood by Whitaker’s sentence as appropriate for such a brutal crime.
Distant_Evaluation	“We represent all of the community.
Distant_Evaluation	It is not just one person we represent,” said Fred Felcman, first assistant district attorney for the Fort Bend County District Attorney’s Office.
Distant_Evaluation	“Legally, justice says that he should be executed.”

Distant_Evaluation	Felcman believes Bart Whitaker is a sociopath and a master manipulator.
Distant_Evaluation	In the clemency petition, Kent Whitaker recalled lying in his hospital bed and facing the choice of slipping into despair or offering his son forgiveness.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He said his faith led him to the latter option, which he hopes will sway Texas officials.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We are not asking them to forgive him, or to let him go,” he added.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We just want them to let him live.”

Main	JERUSALEM, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's army said Wednesday it made preparations for the demolition of the family homes of two Palestinian perpetrators of a 2016 shooting after their homes had been demolished and rebuilt.
Cause_General	The troops surveyed overnight the family homes of the assailants, who carried out a deadly shooting attack in Sarona Market, a recreation compound in Tel Aviv.
Cause_General	"A military spokesperson said in a statement that the residences were rebuilt without a permit after they were demolished in August 2016 by Israel Defense Forces following an order issued by the Commander of the Central Command."""
Main	"""At the moment, the option to demolish the residences again is being examined,"" the statement read."
Distant_Historical	In June 2016, Khalid al-Muhamra and Muhammad Ahmad Moussa Mahmara, cousins from the town of Yatta in the Hebron area in the southern West Bank, opened fire inside a restaurant in Sarona Market, killing three people and wounding others.
Distant_Historical	A fourth woman died of heart attack amidst the attack.
Distant_Historical	An Israeli court convicted them with murder and sentenced them to four life sentences and sixty years.
Cause_General	Since Israel seized the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in 1967, it has demolished hundreds of Palestinian homes as a punitive measure aimed at deterring Palestinians from carrying out attacks against Israelis.
Distant_Historical	In early 2005, an army committee concluded that the measure is ineffective, and Israel halted it.
Distant_Historical	However, the government renewed the controversial practice in 2015 in the wake of the wave of street attacks.
Distant_Evaluation	"The demolitions were denounced by the international community as ""counterproductive"" and Palestinians and human rights organizations say it constitutes an unlawful collective punishment that leaves the relatives homeless."
Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear a Wisconsin man’s challenge to his conviction in a 2005 murder in which he said police coerced him into confessing, a case featured in a Netflix documentary series called “Making a Murderer.”
Main	The justices turned away Brendan Dassey’s appeal of a lower court ruling upholding his conviction for murder, sexual assault and mutilation of a corpse in the death of a freelance photographer named Teresa Halbach.
Distant_Historical	Dassey, 16 years old at the time of the murder and now 28, told police officers who interrogated him four times in 48 hours that he had helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape and kill Halbach.
Distant_Evaluation	Dassey’s lawyers have said he has “significant intellectual and social limitations” and was coerced into confessing in violation of his constitutional rights.
Distant_Historical	Dassey and Avery were convicted of the murder in separate trials.
Cause_General	Avery is now 55.
Cause_General	Both men are in prison in Wisconsin.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Dassey’s attorney, Laura Nirider, said she would continue to fight to free her client.
Distant_Evaluation	“Brendan was a 16 year old with intellectual and social disabilities when he confessed to a crime he did not commit,” she said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“The video of Brendan’s interrogation shows a confused boy who was manipulated by experienced police officers into accepting their story of how the murder of Teresa Halbach happened.”
Distant_Evaluation	Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel was pleased with Monday’s decision.
Distant_Evaluation	“We hope the family and friends of Ms. Halbach can find comfort in knowing this ordeal has finally come to a close,” Schimel said in a statement.
Cause_General	A 10-part Netflix documentary called into question the conduct of law enforcement officials in Manitowoc County, drawing attention to the case and the broader issue of the rights of criminal defendants.
Distant_Historical	The victim’s charred remains were found in an incineration pit at Avery’s home and scrap yard about 80 miles (130 km) north of Milwaukee.
Distant_Historical	Dassey and his uncle were convicted of the 2005 murder in separate trials.
Distant_Historical	Both were given sentences of life in prison.
Distant_Historical	A federal magistrate judge in 2016 found that the confession had been coerced.
Distant_Historical	A three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th U.S.
Distant_Historical	Circuit Court of Appeals initially upheld the judge’s ruling, but in a rehearing requested by state prosecutors the 7th Circuit ruled against Dassey.
Distant_Evaluation	Dassey’s lawyers have said that during interrogation he frequently gave incorrect answers, suggesting he was not involved in the murder.
Distant_Evaluation	They cited exchanges in which Dassey gave correct answers only when fed the answers by the police officers.
Distant_Historical	The 7th Circuit concluded that Dassey had spoken to police voluntarily with his mother’s permission, and provided investigators with “damning details” about the killing in response to open-ended questions.

Error	REUTERS/Radovan Stoklasa
Cause_Specific	The gunning-down of Jan Kuciak, 27, who investigated corruption among politically-connected business people, and his fiancee at their home in February increased widespread anger about persistent corruption allegations.
Cause_General	Long-serving prime minister Robert Fico stepped down to save his three-party government, and picked his deputy, Peter Pellegrini, to lead a reshuffled cabinet.
Main	Thursday’s protesters - estimated to number up to 45,000 by News website Dennik N, close to the 50,000 who marched at the height of protests last month - demanded more tangible change and called for the police chief to resign.
Cause_General	Police did not provide any crowd figures.
Distant_Anecdotal	“The new government hasn’t done anything to convince me it will be different than the old government,” 38-year-old protester Jan Filip said.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Almost all of the cases Kuciak covered could already have been investigated, yet none of them made it to court.”
Distant_Evaluation	Protester’s said police chief Tibor Gaspar must go, and called for the law to be changed to prevent the interior minister naming his successor, something they said might ensure an impartial investigation of Kuciak’s murder.
Distant_Evaluation	President Andrej Kiska repeated his calls for Gaspar to resign to help rebuild public trust.
Distant_Evaluation	Interior Minister Tomas Drucker said he may need weeks to assess Gaspar’s performance.
Cause_Specific	Kuciak, who police believe was murdered in a contract killing related to his journalism, used to report on suspected tax fraud, sometimes by people with links to the ruling Smer party.
Cause_Specific	He also reported on deals between the government and the country’s biggest privately-owned security firm, whose owner is related to Gaspar.
Distant_Evaluation	The police chief has denied any wrongdoing.
Cause_General	Gaspar was appointed in 2012 by Robert Kalinak, who resigned as interior minister last month.
Cause_Specific	Kuciak had published stories about Kalinak, who has denied wrongdoing.
Cause_Specific	Before his death, Kuciak was investigating Italian businessmen in Slovakia with suspected mafia links, one of whom had had business dealings with two people who later worked in Fico’s office before resigning in the wake of the murder.
Distant_Evaluation	The two have denied any links to the killing.
Cause_General	According to Transparency International, no senior Slovak politician has been sent to prison for corruption in the past six years, while six regional politicians have been given suspended sentences.
Cause_General	About 48 percent of bribe cases dealt with by courts involved amounts of less than 100 euros.
Main	An American citizen from Columbus, Ohio, was indicted there Thursday on charges of training with Al Qaeda and conspiring to attack Americans at European resorts and to destroy United States embassies and military bases abroad.
Distant_Historical	Federal prosecutors in Columbus said the suspect, Christopher Paul, 43, began supporting terrorists in the United States, Africa and Europe in 1989, buying explosives and helping to train radical Islamic fundamentalists in Germany.
Distant_Evaluation	The most serious charge, carrying a penalty of life imprisonment, is conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction -- bombs with which, the indictment says, the American tourists, embassies and bases, in unspecified countries, were to be attacked.
Distant_Evaluation	Michael Brooks, an F.B.I.
Distant_Evaluation	spokesman here in Cincinnati, declined to say whether any of the attacks had actually been carried out.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Further details, Mr. Brooks said, will emerge at trial.
Cause_Specific	Mr. Paul, born in Columbus, was arrested at his apartment there late Wednesday and appeared in federal court on Thursday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	His lawyer, Don Wolery, said he would plead not guilty Friday at his arraignment.
Cause_General	Mr. Wolery declined additional comment.
Distant_Anecdotal	But Hisham Jenhawi, a friend of Mr. Paul and his wife, told The Associated Press that he could not believe the charges.
Distant_Anecdotal	''The way he speaks,'' Mr. Jenhawi said, ''the kindness he has, it isn't even close to his personality to do something like this.''
Distant_Anecdotal	Mr. Jenhawi said that he had known Mr. Paul about a year, that they attended the same mosque and that their daughters played together.
Distant_Anecdotal	Mr. Paul's daughter is about 9 years old and is home-schooled, Mr. Jenhawi said.
Cause_General	Mr. Brooks, the F.B.I.
Cause_General	spokesman, said the investigation of Mr. Paul had taken four years, a result, he said, of the complexity of compiling admissible evidence from eight countries.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Paul was born Paul Kenyatta Laws and changed his name to Abdulmalek Kenyatta in 1989 before settling on Christopher Paul in 1994.
Distant_Historical	The indictment says he participated in military-style training in an unspecified county in 1990 and joined Al Qaeda one year later, offering his services on trips to Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Distant_Historical	In Peshawar, Pakistan, it says, he stayed at Beit-ul-Ansar guesthouse, which the United States later designated a base of a foreign terrorist organization affiliated with Al Qaeda.
Distant_Historical	There, the government says, he met a former personal pilot for Osama bin Laden.
Cause_General	The indictment does not describe any outcome of this meeting.
Cause_General	Mr. Paul is married to a woman identified in the indictment only as F. Bashir.
Distant_Historical	Her name appears in connection with a letter that, the government says, Mr. Paul sent her before they were married concerning the rearing of their future children as ''little mujahideen.''
Distant_Historical	The indictment says Mr. Paul stored a variety of items at residences in Columbus, including laser range finders, a night vision scope, books and literature on explosives, remote control devices and survival gear.
Cause_General	Some of those items, seized from Mr. Paul's apartment, are listed by the government as evidence in the coming trial of another terrorism suspect, Nuradin Abdi, who is charged with plotting to blow up a shopping mall in the Columbus area.

Main	CAIRO, Aug. 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian security forces on Monday killed six terrorists during security raids in Sixth of October city, south of the capital Cairo.
Cause_Specific	The Egyptian Interior Ministry said in a statement that the national security agency received information that a terrorist cell is taking a shelter in an apartment in Sixth of October city.
Cause_Specific	According to the information, the terrorist cell is planning a series of hostile attacks to target some vital installations, places of worship, police and army personnel during the upcoming al-Adha feast celebrations.
Main	Police raided the apartment and killed six terrorists in a shootout, the statement said, adding that three of the terrorists were identified.
Cause_General	Three machine guns, a birdshot rifle and bullets were seized during the raid.
Cause_General	Egypt has been fighting a wave of terrorism that killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers, as well as civilians, since the military removed former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in July 2013 in response to mass protests against his one-year rule and his currently outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group.

Main	Stephen “The Rifleman” Flemmi, who is serving a life sentence for 10 murders, told jurors in federal court in Boston that he saw Francis “Cadillac Frank” Salemme’s son strangle Steven DiSarro as his father watched.
Cause_Specific	Flemmi delivered the testimony during his second day on the stand as the star witness in Salemme’s murder trial.
Cause_General	Salemme, who has confessed to eight other murders, denies killing DiSarro.
Distant_Historical	Flemmi said he saw the incident after Salemme, who headed the New England family of La Costa Nostra, in an earlier conversation expressed concerns that DiSarro was speaking to authorities and might implicate him in criminal activities.
Distant_Evaluation	“Did you obtain impression about Mr. DiSarro’s fate?” Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Wyshak asked.
Distant_Evaluation	“Oh yes, Frank wanted to kill him,” Flemmi said.
Distant_Historical	Flemmi, 83, said he witnessed the strangling when on May 10, 1993, he went to Salemme’s home to talk to Salemme, 84, who he had known and worked with since the 1960s.
Distant_Historical	He said that he saw Frank Salemme Jr in the kitchen strangling DiSarro as Paul Weadick, an associate also on trial, held his legs and the senior Salemme watched.
Cause_General	Weadick also denies killing Salemme.
Distant_Historical	Concerned Salemme might be under surveillance, Flemmi said that he quickly left.
Distant_Historical	But he said Salemme later told him DiSarro was killed and that his body was buried in a 20-foot deep hole at a Rhode Island construction site.
Distant_Evaluation	The testimony by Flemmi, who has been cooperating with authorities, provided a flashback to an era when organized crime in Boston was run by Salemme and Bulger, the notorious gangster now serving life in prison.
Distant_Historical	Flemmi, who also testified against Bulger at his 2013 trial, said he last saw Salemme while in jail in 1999.
Distant_Evaluation	On Wednesday, Flemmi said he did not recognize Salemme in the courtroom even though he was sitting nearby.
Distant_Evaluation	“I would recognize him if I see him, but I don’t see him,” Flemmi said.
Distant_Evaluation	According to prosecutors, Salemme had a secret interest in a music venue called The Channel, which DiSarro had purchased.
Distant_Historical	In 1993, a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent told DiSarro he would be indicted and should cooperate with authorities who were probing Salemme and his son, who died in 1995, prosecutors have said.
Distant_Historical	Authorities found his body in 2016 behind a mill in Providence, Rhode Island.

Main	TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto police said on Friday that they have charged Bruce McArthur with a sixth murder, expanding the number of deaths blamed on the 66-year-old landscaper in a case that has shaken the city’s gay community.
Main	Authorities have charged McArthur with the murder of Skandaraj Navaratnam, a 40-year-old man who went missing in 2010 from a neighborhood in downtown Toronto that is known as the city’s gay village, according to Toronto detective Hank Idsinga.
Cause_General	McArthur, who was arrested in January, has not filed a plea on any of the charges.
Cause_General	His lawyer Calvin Rosemond declined to comment when reached by phone on Friday.
Distant_Evaluation	Toronto police have been criticized by some in the gay community for taking years to solve disappearances dating back to at least 2010.
Cause_Specific	Navaratnam’s remains were among those found in large planters at a north Toronto home where McArthur did landscaping work, Idsinga said at a press conference.
Cause_General	Police have yet to identify three other individuals whose remains were found in the planters, Idsinga said.
Cause_General	McArthur has also been charged with killing five other men: Selim Esen, Andrew Kinsman, Majeed Kayhan, Soroush Marmudi and Dean Lisowick.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Police have said they will continue to search for evidence of more killings as they believe there are more victims.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	When the ground warms up, authorities intend to use police dogs to search for more evidence on the grounds of the home where the remains have been found, Idsinga said.

Main	Assistant U.S. Attorney William Ferland asked the federal jury in Boston to credit the testimony of Stephen “The Rifleman” Flemmi, who said he saw the son of Francis “Cadillac Frank” Salemme strangle Steven DiSarro as the elder Salemme watched.
Cause_Specific	Ferland said Flemmi told authorities about DiSarro’s slaying when he cut a deal to plead guilty to 10 murders and become a cooperating witness in 2003, long before DiSarro’s remains were found in Rhode Island in 2016.
Cause_Specific	Flemmi testified that on May 10, 1993, he went to Salemme’s home, where he saw Salemme’s now-deceased son, Frank Jr., strangle DiSarro as Paul Weadick, an associate also on trial, held his legs and Salemme Sr. watched.
Distant_Evaluation	Ferland said Salemme decided to have DiSarro killed after coming to believe he was cooperating with authorities investigating him.
Distant_Evaluation	“He looks like a seasoned, old, polite gentleman,” Ferland told jurors, pointing to the 84-year-old defendant.
Distant_Evaluation	“That’s not who we’re talking about here.
Distant_Evaluation	We’re talking about Frank Salemme from 25 years ago.”
Distant_Evaluation	Steven Boozang, Salemme’s lawyer, countered by urging jurors to reject the testimony of the government’s star witnesses including Flemmi, who he called a “sociopath.”
Distant_Evaluation	He argued Flemmi, who is serving a life prison term, made up the story of witnessing DiSarro’s murder in order to implicate a top organized crime figure and win a potential sentence reduction.
Distant_Evaluation	“He’s a career opportunist,” Boozang said in his closing argument.
Distant_Evaluation	“He’s deceived people his whole life.

Main	“A murder investigation has been launched following the results of a post mortem into the death of 68-year-old Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov,” London’s Metropolitan Police said, adding the cause of death was “compression to the neck”.
Distant_Evaluation	The police said in a statement that at this stage there was nothing to suggest a link to the attempted murders of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter on March 4 or that poison was involved.
Cause_General	Earlier on Friday Russia’s Investigative Committee said it had opened a criminal investigation into both the attempted murder of Yulia Skripal and what it said was the murder of Glushkov.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It also said it was ready to cooperate with British authorities on the two cases.
Distant_Evaluation	British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Friday it was “overwhelmingly likely” that Russian President Vladimir Putin himself had made the decision to use a military-grade nerve toxin to strike down Sergei Skripal.
Distant_Evaluation	Russia has denied any involvement and has accused Britain of whipping up Russophobia
Distant_Evaluation	London police said specialist counter-terrorism officers continued to lead the investigation into Glushkov’s death as a precaution due to the associations he was believed to have had.
Distant_Evaluation	“GODFATHER OF THE KREMLIN”
Cause_General	British interior minister Amber Rudd instructed police and intelligence services earlier this week to look at 14 deaths over recent years which were not originally treated as suspicious by police but where media allegations of Russian state involvement had been made.
Cause_General	Glushkov had worked for Russian airline Aeroflot and at Berezovksy’s LogoVAZ car company.
Distant_Historical	Berezovsky was found dead in March 2013 with a scarf tied around his neck in the bathroom of a luxury mansion west of London.
Distant_Historical	The 67-year-old tycoon had been one of Russia’s most powerful figures in the years after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Distant_Historical	Berezovsky was known as the “godfather of the Kremlin” before fleeing to London after a row with Putin in 2000, the year the former KGB officer became Russia’s president.
Distant_Historical	Britain granted Berezovsky political asylum three years later on the grounds that his life would be in danger if he went back home.
Distant_Historical	His family feared he might have been murdered by enemies in Russia, but British police and forensic experts concluded that Berezovsky had committed suicide.
Distant_Historical	A British judge in 2014 reached an open verdict on Berezovsky’s death, saying he could not be sure if the Russian killed himself at his former wife’s British home or was the victim of foul play.
Main	KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Two women charged with murdering the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un must answer for their role in a well-planned conspiracy, a Malaysian judge said on Thursday, but added that the evidence did not prove a political assassination.
Cause_Specific	Indonesian Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong, a Vietnamese, face the death penalty on charges of murdering Kim Jong Nam by smearing his face with VX, a nerve agent banned by the United Nations, at a Kuala Lumpur airport on Feb. 13 last year.
Main	The murder was a “well-planned conspiracy between the women and the four North Koreans at large”, trial judge Azmi Ariffin said in a ruling that took more than two hours to read.
Main	“I must therefore call upon them to enter their defense.”
Main	He added, “I cannot rule out that this could be a political assassination.
Main	Despite that, I am unable to confirm this fact.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The court has set dates for the women to take the stand between November and next February.
Cause_General	Both women arrived at the high court on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital handcuffed and wearing bulletproof vests, to be escorted into the courtroom by gun-wielding policemen.
Cause_General	They are in their 20s and both have pleaded not guilty, saying they thought they were involved in a prank for a reality TV show.
Distant_Evaluation	However, Azmi said he was not persuaded by the defense argument, since there was no hidden crew and no attempt to bring the target in on the joke, as is usual in such shows.

Cause_General	Huong did not react to the ruling, but Siti Aisyah burst into tears and had to be comforted by her lawyers and officials of the Indonesian embassy.
Distant_Evaluation	She was very disappointed, said her lawyer, Gooi Soon Seng, who expressed surprise at the decision.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are still very confident that we have a good defense,” he added.
Distant_Evaluation	“It does not mean they are found guilty, it just means that he (the judge) found that the prosecution have proven there is a prima facie case.”
Distant_Evaluation	Huong’s lawyers also said they did not expect the ruling.
Distant_Evaluation	In Vietnam, responding to Thursday’s events, her father, Doan Van Thanh, said, “I don’t know what to do next.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	I just hope they will announce her innocent so that she can return home.”
Distant_Evaluation	POLITICALLY MOTIVATED
Distant_Evaluation	Defense lawyers say the killing was politically motivated, with many key suspects linked to the North Korean embassy in the Malaysian capital, suggesting the women were simply pawns.
Distant_Evaluation	But the judge said the women’s conduct before and after the attack supported a case against them, citing CCTV recordings of their meeting with other North Korean suspects and going to a airport bathroom to wash their hands immediately after the VX attack.
Distant_Evaluation	Kim Jong Nam, who was living in exile in Macau, had criticized his family’s dynastic rule of North Korea and his brother had ordered his execution, South Korean lawmakers have said.
Distant_Evaluation	Pyongyang has denied accusations by South Korean and U.S. officials that Kim Jong Un’s regime was behind the killing.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In June, Malaysia said it planned to reopen its embassy in Pyongyang, suggesting an end to the rift in once-close diplomatic ties that followed the killing.
Cause_General	The prosecution wrapped up its case in June, based on testimony from 34 witnesses, including experts who said traces of VX were found on the clothing of both women.
Cause_General	Video recordings played in court showed them meeting two of the fugitives at the airport before the attack.

Cause_Specific	The incident took place on Oct. 7 in the Barkan Industrial Zone, a settlement industrial compound in the northern Israeli-occupied West Bank, where Israelis and Palestinians work side by side.
Cause_Specific	According to eyewitnesses, the killer, 23-year-old Ashraf Na'alowa, took plastic restraints from the factory warehouse, saying that he needed them to fix an electrical problem.
Cause_Specific	After fixing, he took his rifle, went up to the second floor, and forced a Palestinian cleaner to tie an Israeli worker with the restraints.

Cause_Specific	Then the murderer managed to escape and was never caught.
Cause_Specific	According to the indictments, the murderer's mother knew that her son had a weapon and trained with it.
Cause_Specific	According to the prosecution, two weeks prior to the attack, the murderer told his mother of his intentions to commit it.
Cause_Specific	The mother also informed the brother of these details, but the two failed to act to prevent the attack, as alleged in the indictment.

Main	ISTANBUL, Dec. 14 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that some persons close to Saudi Arabia's crown prince assumed an active role in the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
Main	"""We understand from the voice recordings that those closest to the crown prince had an active role in Khashoggi's killing,"" Erdogan said at a conference in Istanbul."

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"Speaking about the resolution, Erdogan said there would be more developments about the issue as ""Turkey submitted all the information to Americans."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Erdogan also stressed that his country would continue to chase the issue until the end to reveal the naked truth behind the murder.
Cause_Specific	According to the Istanbul prosecutor, Khashoggi was strangled to death after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and his body was then dismembered and destroyed.
Cause_Specific	Earlier this month, Istanbul's chief prosecutor issued arrest warrants for two Saudi suspects, identified as former deputy head of Saudi intelligence and a former aide to the Saudi crown prince, over the killing of Khashoggi.

Distant_Evaluation	Organizers said 1,200 protested, while the police estimated 600 attended at the peak.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The city’s security chief said on Tuesday the police had advised him to ban the Hong Kong National Party, which openly promotes the city’s secession from China.
Distant_Evaluation	The chief, John Lee, has not officially banned the group yet, saying he could not do so before it has a chance to explain itself.
Distant_Evaluation	He said Hong Kong still has freedom of association, as enshrined in its mini-constitution known as the Basic Law, but “that right is not without restriction.”
Cause_Specific	But the developments mark the first time since Hong Kong’s handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997 that the government has moved to outlaw a political organization.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Hong Kong is starting to prosecute people for their speech,” said protester Isabella Yeung, a teacher in her 40s.
Distant_Anecdotal	“The group has not taken any action or caused any violence.
Distant_Anecdotal	All it did was speaking.”
Cause_General	Most of the protesters were not supporters of independence for Hong Kong.
Cause_General	But trailing at the end of the march about 50 people, many wearing face masks, waved “Hong Kong independence” flags and shouted: “We are Hong Kongers, not Chinese.”
Cause_General	Piercing through the chants was the shrill of about 100 black whistles - a local metaphor for injustice.
Cause_General	Hong Kong has a separate political and legal system from China under a “One Country, Two Systems” principle, which promises the city a high degree of autonomy and a wide range of freedoms, including freedom of speech and freedom of association.
Distant_Historical	But after a months-long “Umbrella Movement” street occupation in 2014 failed to pressure Beijing to allow full democracy in Hong Kong, calls for independence emerged.
Distant_Evaluation	Chinese President Xi Jinping has said any attempt to challenge China’s national sovereignty crosses a red line.
Distant_Evaluation	Benny Tai, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong and an initiator of the “Umbrella Movement” said the proposed ban on the Hong Kong National Party was part of a wider trend of using existing laws to restrict political freedoms.
Distant_Evaluation	“After the Umbrella Movement, the Communist Party has started to adjust its strategy towards Hong Kong,” said Tai, who joined Saturday’s protests.
Distant_Evaluation	“Part of it is to use the law to suppress.”

Main	The jurors handed down the verdict after about two hours of deliberation, convicting Alberto Ochoa of one count each of first-degree murder, assault with a deadly weapon, second-degree robbery and attempted second-degree robbery.
Cause_General	Ochoa, who faces life in prison without parole, will be sentenced on March 8 next year, though he is entitled to a parole hearing after spending 25 years behind bars under California state law given his age at the time of the crimes.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We're very satisfied with the outcome of this case,"" Deputy District Attorney John McKinney told reporters outside court after the verdict."
Distant_Evaluation	"""We believe the jury listened to the evidence, followed the law, returned the proper verdict."

Main	CAIRO, Nov. 25 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Sunday confirmed death sentence against 10 defendants over killing former public prosecutor in a bomb attack on his car in 2015, state-run Ahram newspapers reported on its website.
Cause_Specific	The defendants were convicted of premeditated murder, association with a terrorist organization, and possessing weapons and explosives.
Main	The Court of Cassation, Egypt's top court that gives final verdicts, reduced death sentence to life in prison (which is 25 years in Egypt) for six others who have been charged in the same case after receiving the decision of the Grand Mufti.
Cause_General	The Grand Mufti, the country's interpreter of religious law, is the country's highest Islamic official who gives religious judgment of all preliminary death sentences.
Cause_General	The Mufti's opinion is non-binding as it is usually considered a formality, but it could alleviate the sentences in some cases and the top court could take it.

Cause_Specific	Tens of thousands of Slovaks have been protesting since the February murder of Jan Kuciak, who investigated corruption and links between politicians and businessmen, and his fiancee.
Cause_Specific	The protesters have been demanding guarantees of an independent investigation of the case.
Cause_General	The demonstrations - the biggest in decades in the EU member country - led long-term prime minister Robert Fico to resign along with his cabinet last month.
Cause_Specific	Police President Tibor Gaspar was another top official on the protesters’ list.
Distant_Evaluation	“I see the police president as a competent professional ...
Distant_Evaluation	But I see he was the target of enormous political pressure, even attacks on all the police force,” said new Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We agreed that in order to calm the tensions and free the police from media pressure, he will resign by the end of May.”
Distant_Evaluation	Pellegrini is a member of Fico’s Smer party, which has been losing voter support in recent weeks, although the next election is not due for two years.
Cause_General	The new cabinet is made up of the same three parties as the previous administration.
Distant_Evaluation	Fico still leads the party, giving him a behind-the-scenes position of informal power similar to that which Law and Justice Party chief Jaroslaw Kaczynski holds in Poland.
Cause_General	In power for 10 of the last 12 years, Fico has avoided disputes with Brussels over the rule of law unlike neighboring Poland and Hungary.
Cause_General	He has positioned Slovakia as a ‘pro-European island’ among euro-sceptics.
Distant_Evaluation	Protesters say Fico’s cabinets failed to fight sleaze in politics, however, and they fear that the government reshuffle has not gone far enough.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While they also sought the departure of the police chief, Pellegrini said Gaspar’s departure would have little effect.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Gaspar’s resignation will not have any impact on the investigation of (Kuciak’s) murder as the police chief has not had any influence on the investigation so far,” Pellegrini said.
Distant_Evaluation	Nobody has been charged in connection with the murder, which the prosecutor overseeing the case said was likely a contract killing.
Cause_General	Kuciak’s last story, published posthumously, investigated links between Italian businessmen in Slovakia, one of whom has since been charged in cases involving drug trafficking in Italy and abuse of EU subsidies in Slovakia, and two Slovaks who later went on to work in Fico’s government office.
Distant_Evaluation	All have denied any wrongdoing.
Cause_General	Some of Kuciak’s reporting also dealt with deals between the government and Slovakia’s biggest privately owned security firm, whose owner is related to Gaspar.
Distant_Evaluation	The police chief has denied wrongdoing or any conflict of interest.
Cause_General	Gaspar’s previous reluctance to quit forced Interior Minister Tomas Drucker to announce his own resignation on Monday, just three weeks after taking the job.
Distant_Evaluation	Drucker said he did not have grounds to fire Gaspar and could not square such a move with the public pressure for him to go.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Pellegrini said he hoped to find “within days” a replacement for Drucker who will in turn pick a caretaker police chief.
Distant_Evaluation	President Andrej Kiska, a long-time adversary of Fico, said Gaspar’s departure was the least the government could do to ease the situation.
Distant_Evaluation	“A new minister has to strengthen the guarantees of an independent and impartial investigation of the murder of Jan Kuciak and Martina Kusnirova, as well as numerous (other) unsolved scandals.”

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Zschaepe’s lawyer, Mathias Grasel, said he would appeal against Wednesday’s ruling.
Distant_Evaluation	“The verdict is wrong!” Grasel said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“Conviction for complicity is legally untenable.

Distant_Historical	She had disappeared four days earlier from Blacksburg, where Virginia Tech is located, and the crime left the university and local community reeling.
Distant_Evaluation	Eisenhauer may have had an inappropriate relationship with Lovell, the Washington Post has reported.
Distant_Anecdotal	Lovell told a friend she planned to run away with Eisenhauer and start a family, the Post reported.
Cause_General	Under Virginia law, a defendant can plead no contest without admitting to the crime if the defendant agrees that the prosecutor has enough evidence that the court return a guilty verdict.
Cause_General	It is treated the same as a guilty plea for conviction and sentencing.
Cause_General	A second former Virginia Polytechnic Institute student, Natalie Keepers, who is charged with being Eisenhauer’s accomplice and helping to conceal Lovell’s body faces trial later this year after pleading not guilty.
Distant_Evaluation	Keepers, 20, became friends with Eisenhauer, a fellow engineering student, before Lovell’s abduction, according to police in Blacksburg.

Main	VALLETTA (Reuters) - A Maltese magistrate on Wednesday refused bail to three men accused of murdering Maltese anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia last year, saying they could flee and their release would upset the public.
Distant_Evaluation	“The way the murder was committed was very disturbing and bore a close resemblance to a mafia execution.
Distant_Evaluation	Therefore the court feels it should protect society from the disturbance which granting bail would create,” Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit said in her decreed denying bail.
Distant_Evaluation	“The victim was not an ordinary individual, she was a journalist, and therefore her murder can be interpreted as an attack on freedom of expression, which is one of the pillars of our society,” she said.
Distant_Historical	Alfred Degiorgio, his brother George Degiorgio, and Vince Muscat were arrested at the end of last year and accused of the October 2017 car-bomb assassination, though police have said they suspect the murder was ordered by someone else.
Distant_Historical	In pre-trial hearings, prosecutors said the bomb had been placed in Caruana Galizia’s car and set off by a text message from a mobile phone on a yacht belonging to the Degiorgios.
Distant_Evaluation	Stafrace Zammit has already ruled that there is enough evidence for the three to be tried, but the trial’s start date has not been set.
Cause_General	All three are pleading not guilty.
Distant_Evaluation	On Wednesday, the magistrate said her decision was based on the gravity of the crime and her belief that “on the basis of their record” the men probably would not hesitate to flee if granted bail.
Distant_Evaluation	The accused may not have acted alone, she said, so their release could also interfere with efforts to track down others who may have been involved.
Cause_General	Since Caruana Galizia’s murder, Malta has come under pressure from European Union institutions, with an inquiry under way on its banking supervision and calls for investigations into the Mediterranean island country’s rule of law.

Main	AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Texas on Wednesday executed a man dubbed the “ice pick killer” for the weapon he used to murder a woman in 1979, after the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a last-minute appeal from his lawyers, who argued his veins were too compromised for a lethal injection.

Cause_General	Danny Bible, 66, was put to death at the state’s death chamber in Huntsville.
Cause_General	His execution was the 12th this year in the United States and the seventh in Texas, which has executed more inmates than any state since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976.
Cause_General	Bible made no last statement, a prisons official said.
Cause_General	His execution occurred in a typical time frame for a lethal injection procedure.
Cause_Specific	Bible was convicted of the rape and murder of Inez Deaton, 20, who went to his home to use his phone and was stabbed 11 times with an ice pick.
Distant_Historical	Her body was dumped near a Houston bayou.
Distant_Historical	The crime went unsolved for nearly 20 years, until Bible confessed to the murder and other sexual assaults that included raping an 11-year-old girl in Montana.
Distant_Historical	He had gone on a rape and murder spree that included the 1983 killing of his sister-in-law, her infant son and her roommate, court records show.
Distant_Historical	After a plea deal for a 25-year sentence in those killings, Bible served eight years and was paroled.
Distant_Historical	After his early release under a program that Texas has since abandoned, he raped a woman in Louisiana and was apprehended in Florida.
Distant_Historical	Soon afterward, he admitted to the ice pick murder.
Cause_General	“Bible has killed at least four people, including an infant,” Texas said in a court filing.
Cause_General	“Unlike many offenders, he remained violent as he aged, committing his most recent rape in his late forties.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Bible’s lawyers said there was undeniable evidence his recent medical deterioration has rendered his veins inaccessible or incapable of sustaining a lethal injection.
Distant_Evaluation	Over the years, Bible contracted coronary disease, diabetes and hypertension, they said.
Cause_General	Two executions of inmates with compromised veins have been botched recently, one in Ohio and another in Alabama.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Their lawyers warned courts the men were too frail and their veins were not suitable.
Cause_General	In both cases, the states were unable to place intravenous lines and called off their executions while the inmates were on death chamber gurneys.

Main	YANGON, Oct. 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar burnt confiscated ivory and wildlife parts in the capital of Nay Pyi Taw Thursday aiming to combat illegal wildlife trade in the country.
Main	The authorities ceremonially destroyed seized wildlife parts, including 277 ivory, 227 elephant and other wildlife bones, 45 pieces of different wildlife skins, 1,544 various horns, 45.5 kg of pangolin scales and 128 varieties of other wildlife parts with total estimated weight of 849.26 kg.
Distant_Evaluation	The public burning, the first of its kind in Myanmar, sent a clear message that trade in illegal wildlife parts is unacceptable.
Cause_Specific	"Noting that poaching and illegal trade of wildlife in Myanmar have been increasing, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation said in a statement that ""the confiscated items of wildlife were destroyed to raise public awareness for law enforcement on illegal trade of wild fauna and flora, for legal action taken against illegal wildlife, trading and poaching and for promoting international cooperation with Myanmar in fighting the illegal trade in wildlife."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""It is crucial to sustainably conserve our country's natural resources including land, water, forest, mountain and wildlife for the sake of our future generation."
Cause_General	"We designate and establish protected areas for biodiversity conservation,"" said Minister U Ohn Win at the wildlife parts destruction ceremony."
Cause_General	Some 42 areas which account for 5.79 percent of the total land of Myanmar, have been designated as protected zones, he added.
Distant_Historical	Under the Conservation of Biodiversity and Protected Areas Law enacted in May, wildlife protection has been classified at three levels -- totally protected, normally protected and seasonally protected species.
Cause_General	Elephant, tiger, leopard, gaur, bear, golden deer and pangolin are named as totally protected species.
Cause_General	Under the law, one can be sentenced to at least 3 to 10 years in prison with a fine if he or she kills or injures animals on the list of totally protected species, collects or trades their parts.
Cause_General	Illegal trade of totally protected fauna and flora will also be punished under the law.
Cause_General	About 284 suspects have been arrested in connection with 140 wildlife crime cases since fiscal year 2016-2017.
Cause_General	The wildlife crimes mostly occurred in Yangon, Bago and Ayeyarwaddy regions.
Cause_General	The national wildlife enforcement task force, formed in 2016, has been implementing an action plan to combat poaching and illegal trade in cooperation with local and international organizations.
Distant_Evaluation	According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), there exists a big market for illegal wildlife trade in the Golden Triangle area where Myanmar, Laos and Thailand meet and Myanmar has become a trading hub with increasing demand of wildlife products.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, Myanmar forest authorities are conducting awareness campaign to stop shops selling wildlife animal souvenirs at pagoda precincts, airports and markets.
Distant_Historical	Myanmar's Wildlife Protection and Protected Areas Law 1994 was revised and enacted on May 21, 2018.
Distant_Historical	Elephant conservationist U Kyaw Myint Tun was selected as the monthly gratitude honor to the people in July by Myanmar State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi for his actively participating in wild elephant protection and conservation.
Distant_Historical	Joining hands with the authorities in protecting wild elephants from being poached, U Kyaw Myint Tun was awarded the Hero of Elephant Conservation by the WWF and the Friends of Wildlife (FOW).
Distant_Historical	Two poachers were caught in 2016 with arms used to poach wild elephants, and four guns and materials used to kill elephants were seized in 2017 due to his active cooperation with the government.

Main	ISTANBUL, Dec. 5 (Xinhua) -- Istanbul's chief prosecutor on Wednesday issued arrest warrants for two Saudi Arabian citizens over the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a local newspaper reported.
Main	The Hurriyet daily identified the suspects as former deputy head of Saudi intelligence General Ahmed Asiri and Saud al-Qahtani, a former aide to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud.
Distant_Evaluation	"The chief prosecutor said in a statement that there is a ""strong suspicion that Asiri and al-Qahtani were among planners of Khashoggi's killing,"" the daily said."
Cause_Specific	According to the Istanbul prosecutor, Khashoggi was strangled to death after he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 and his body was then dismembered and destroyed.
Distant_Evaluation	"The Saudi public prosecutor has demanded ""death penalty"" against five of the suspects implicated in the murder of Khashoggi."
Main	MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Gunmen shot and killed a mayor running for re-election in Mexico on Thursday, the second murder of a politician in a week after a candidate running for federal office was shot in the back of the head while taking a selfie with a supporter.
Cause_General	At least 113 politicians have been killed in the bloodiest election campaign in Mexico’s modern history, and the violence appears to be intensifying in the final weeks before the July 1 nationwide election.
Cause_General	Political assassinations have rocked the electoral season leading up to July 1, when voters will decide over 3,000 down-ballot seats and elect a new president.
Distant_Evaluation	Widespread disenchantment with the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) over record levels of violence, political corruption and sluggish economic growth has helped propel leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to lead voter preferences for the presidency.
Cause_General	The mayoral candidate, Alejandro Chavez Zavala, of the right-left coalition led by the National Action Party (PAN), died in a hospital on Thursday while being treated for wounds, Michoacan Governor Silvano Aureoles said in a tweet.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Aureoles demanded justice for the small-town mayor’s murder and said that authorities would investigate the attack, in which Chavez’s wife was also injured.
Cause_General	The announcement of Chavez’s death follows the disappearance of Ismael Aguirre Rodriguez, a mayoral candidate in Nadadores, a hamlet in northern Coahuila state.
Cause_General	Aguirre went missing in broad daylight on Tuesday after he stepped out to buy drinks, according to local media.
Main	Fernando Puron, a federal candidate for the PRI, was slain Friday in Coahuila state after a bearded gunman opened fire on him as he greeted supporters following a political debate in Piedras Negras, a border city in northern Mexico.
Cause_General	The shocking scene was captured on a CCTV camera.
Cause_General	According to Mexico City-based security consultancy Etellekt, at least 113 candidates and politicians have been killed since September.
Cause_General	Many of the slain candidates were running for local office.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The risk going forward is that there will be reluctance to participate in local politics because it has become so dangerous,” said Michael Lettieri, a historian at the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego.

Main	ANKARA, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- Turkish prosecutors have charged 28 suspects, including U.S.-based cleric Fetullah Gulen, over assassination of Russian Ambassador to Turkey Andrey Karlov, Anadolu Agency reported on Friday.
Cause_Specific	Andrey Karlov was shot dead by an off-duty Turkish police officer Mevlut Mert Altintas at the opening of an art gallery exhibition in Ankara on Dec. 19, 2016.
Cause_General	Turkish prosecutors have completed two-year investigation into the assassination of Russian envoy and submitted the indictment to an Ankara court.
Distant_Evaluation	"The indictment says the assassination ""is an act of provocation targeting Turkey-Russia relations."""
Distant_Evaluation	According to the indictment, the murderer previously planned to kill the ambassador at a dinner for ambassadors hosted by the ruling party on June 27, 2016, but the assassination attempt failed as Karlov was abroad on that day.
Distant_Historical	A total of eight people were arrested as part of the investigation, including four former police officers.
Distant_Historical	Fethullah Gulen, the U.S.-based preacher, is accused by Ankara of orchestrating a failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.

Main	LONDON (Reuters) - London police investigated more murders than their New York counterparts did over the last two months, statistics show, as the British capital’s mayor vowed to fight a “violent scourge” on the streets.
Cause_Specific	There were 15 murders in London in February against 14 in New York, according to London’s Metropolitan Police Service and the New York Police Department.
Cause_Specific	For March, 22 murders were investigated in London, with 21 reports in New York.
Cause_General	In the latest bloodshed, a 17-year-old girl died on Monday after she was found with gunshot wounds in Tottenham, north London, a day after a man was fatally stabbed in south London.
Distant_Evaluation	“The Mayor is deeply concerned by violent crime in the capital - every life lost to violent crime is a tragedy,” a spokeswoman for Mayor Sadiq Khan said in a statement on Tuesday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Our city remains one of the safest in the world ... but Sadiq wants it to be even safer and is working hard to bring an end to this violent scourge.”
Cause_General	Including January’s figures, New York had still experienced more murders so far this year than London.
Cause_General	The cities have a similar-sized population.
Distant_Evaluation	Gun violence is much less of a problem in Britain, which has strict gun control laws, than in the United States, and most British police are not equipped with firearms.
Distant_Evaluation	But British politicians and police are increasingly expressing concern about London’s rising murder rate, which is driven by a surge in knife crime.
Cause_General	Of the 47 murders in London so far this year, 31 have been committed with knives.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Britain’s interior ministry said it was consulting on new laws to further restrict dangerous weapons, including banning online stores from delivering knives to residential addresses and making it an offence to possess certain weapons in public.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“This government is taking action to restrict access to offensive weapons as well as working to break the deadly cycle of violence and protect our children, families and communities,” a Home Office spokesman said.
Cause_General	Khan, who has been in office since May 2016, is from the opposition Labour Party.
Distant_Historical	Before him, Conservative Boris Johnson was mayor for eight years.
Distant_Historical	The national government has been run by the Conservatives since 2010, with Prime Minister Theresa May previously serving as interior minister from 2010 to 2016.
Distant_Evaluation	Britain’s most senior officer, London police chief Cressida Dick, said gangs were using online platforms to glamorize violence, adding that disputes between young people could escalate within minutes on social media.
Distant_Evaluation	The Ben Kinsella Trust, an anti-knife crime charity named after a young victim, said social media amplified a range of other factors that have contributed to the crisis.

Main	BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A Belgian court sentenced Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam and a co-accused to 20 years in prison on Monday for trying to kill police during a shootout in Brussels in 2016.
Cause_Specific	Judge Marie-France Keutgen told the courtroom that 28-year-old Abdeslam and Tunisian Sofien Ayari, 24, had been found guilty of “attempted terrorist murder” during the shootout in March 2016.
Cause_General	Abdeslam is in a French prison awaiting trial for his role in the Islamic State attacks in Paris in November 2015 in which 130 people were killed.
Cause_General	Prosecutors say he is the lone survivor of a suicide squad.
Cause_General	Neither he nor Ayari, who is in custody in Belgium, was present for the judgment.
Cause_General	Despite the absence of both accused, security was tight around the Brussels court, with heavily armed police on guard.
Distant_Historical	By the time of the shootout in the Brussels district of Forest on March 15, 2016, Abdeslam had been in hiding for four months after fleeing Paris the night his elder brother blew himself up at a cafe.
Distant_Evaluation	Prosecutors who accuse Abdeslam of helping organize the attacks and ferry former fighters from Syria around Europe say he, too, would have died if his suicide vest had not failed to detonate.
Cause_General	His lawyers do not dispute Abdeslam was in Paris during the attacks.
Distant_Historical	They finally stumbled across him when, with French officers, they went to inspect a suspect apartment in Forest and then came under a hail of gunfire which wounded four of them.
Distant_Historical	After a three-hour siege ended with marksmen killing a 35-year-old Algerian called Mohamed Belkaid, police found an arms cache.
Distant_Historical	Abdeslam’s DNA found at the scene linked him to the shootout and that led to his arrest three days later in a different apartment in Brussels.
Error	Slideshow (4 Images)
Distant_Historical	Four days after his arrest, suicide bombers attacked Brussels Airport and the city’s metro, killing 32 people.
Distant_Evaluation	Officials believe Abdeslam had links with the bombers and that they brought forward their attack because they feared Abdeslam might reveal their plans under interrogation.
Distant_Historical	Abdeslam was present on the opening day of the trial, but refused to answer the judge’s questions.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	His lawyer Sven Mary told reporters on Monday that he discuss the case with his client before determining whether to appeal.

Distant_Evaluation	(Reuters) - The man suspected of killing five people in a Maryland newsroom posted a barrage of hostile tweets over more than two years about the newspaper but law enforcement remained unaware of those posts until after the attack, the local police chief said on Friday.
Distant_Historical	Police, however, had known that the suspect, Jarrod Ramos, had posted threatening comments on his web page about the newspaper, which he had unsuccessfully sued for defamation in 2012.
Distant_Evaluation	“We were not aware of that history until last night.
Distant_Evaluation	Should we have been?
Distant_Evaluation	In a perfect world, sure, we should have been.
Distant_Evaluation	We were not,” Anne Arundel County Police Chief Timothy Altomare conceded about the tweets at a briefing the day after the shooting at the Annapolis office of the Capital Gazette news group.
Distant_Evaluation	“We get a threat call a day.
Distant_Evaluation	It is hard to keep up with them,” Altomare said.
Distant_Historical	Ramos had accused one of the Capital Gazette’s newspapers, The Capital, of defamation for reporting on his guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of harassing a female acquaintance online.
Distant_Historical	After his suit was tossed out of court in 2013, Capital Gazette attorneys and officials alerted police about “frank comments” online by Ramos directed at the newspaper and its journalists, Altomare told the briefing.
Distant_Historical	But during a 2013 conference call between Capital Gazette attorneys and police investigators, lawyers said the company decided against pressing harassment charges against Ramos, the chief said.
Distant_Evaluation	“There was a fear that doing so would exacerbate an already flammable situation,” Altomare said.
Cause_General	A representative from the Baltimore Sun Media Group, which owns the Capital Gazette, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Distant_Evaluation	When asked why the department did not insist on pursuing criminal charges at the time, Altomare said it was the investigator’s call and he would not question it in hindsight.
Distant_Evaluation	“If it is felony, we push,” Altomare said.
Distant_Evaluation	“If it is a misdemeanor - a lot of misdemeanors go the way of not charging.
Distant_Evaluation	I don’t feel the department was negligent in any way.”
Distant_Evaluation	“LEAVE ME ALONE”
Distant_Historical	Ramos began by at least 2014 to post regularly on a Twitter account about his legal battle against The Capital, using a handle that incorporated the name of the reporter who wrote the story that triggered the failed defamation lawsuit.
Distant_Historical	The tweets on the account @EricHartleyFrnd referenced the battle against The Capital, its then-editor Thomas Marquardt and reporter Eric Hartley, who has since left the newspaper.
Distant_Historical	“Yes, Eric Thomas Hartley, you moved to ... oh just go ahead and kill yourself already before I do (legally in court),” read a tweet in 2014.
Distant_Historical	The account abruptly went silent in January 2016.
Cause_General	But on Thursday, before the newsroom shooting began, a new post appeared: “Fuck you, leave me alone @judgemoylanfrnd,” a reference to Judge Charles Moylan, who upheld the dismissal of the defamation case in 2015.
Main	Ramos, 38, from Laurel, Maryland, faces five counts of first degree murder in Anne Arundel County criminal court.
Distant_Evaluation	Marquardt told the Baltimore Sun he was not surprised to hear Ramos identified as the gunman.
Distant_Evaluation	“I was seriously concerned he would threaten us with physical violence,” Marquardt said.
Distant_Evaluation	“I even told my wife, ‘We have to be concerned.
Distant_Evaluation	This guy could really hurt us.’”
Main	LONDON (Reuters) - Britain charged two Russians in absentia on Wednesday with the attempted murder of a former Russian spy and his daughter, and said the suspects were military intelligence officers almost certainly acting on orders from high up in the Russian state.
Cause_Specific	British police revealed images of the two men they said had flown to Britain for a weekend in March to kill former spy Sergei Skripal with Novichok, a military-grade nerve agent.
Cause_General	Skripal’s daughter Yulia and a police officer who attended the scene also fell ill in the case, which has caused the biggest East-West diplomatic expulsions since the Cold War.
Cause_General	A woman later died from Novichok poisoning after her partner found a counterfeit perfume bottle which police believe had been used to smuggle the nerve agent into Britain.
Cause_General	British authorities identified the suspects as Russian nationals traveling on genuine passports under the aliases Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov.
Cause_Specific	Prime Minister Theresa May told parliament the government had concluded they were officers in Russia’s military intelligence service, the GRU.
Distant_Evaluation	“The GRU is a highly disciplined organization with a well-established chain of command, so this was not a rogue operation,” May said.
Distant_Evaluation	“It was almost certainly also approved outside the GRU at a senior level of the Russian state.”
Cause_Specific	Skripal, himself a former GRU officer who betrayed dozens of agents to Britain’s MI6 foreign spy service, was found unconscious with Yulia on a public bench in the southern English city of Salisbury on March 4.
Cause_Specific	Police released security camera images of the two suspects and outlined a three-day mission that took them from Moscow to London to Salisbury, where they sprayed poison on Skripal’s door before flying back to Moscow hours later.
Cause_General	The Russian charge d’affaires in London was summoned to the Foreign Office to be told Britain wanted those responsible to be brought to justice.
Distant_Evaluation	However Moscow, which has repeatedly denied any involvement in the attack, said the names meant nothing.
Distant_Evaluation	“We have heard or seen two names, these names mean nothing to me personally,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters in Moscow.
Distant_Evaluation	“I don’t understand why this was done and what sort of signal the British side is sending.”
Cause_General	Britain and dozens of other countries have kicked out scores of Russian diplomats over the incident, and Moscow has responded tit-for-tat with an identical number of expulsions.
Distant_Evaluation	The affair has worsened Russian relations with the West, already under strain over Ukraine, Syria and other issues.
Cause_General	May’s spokesman said May had briefed U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday evening.
Distant_Evaluation	U.S.
Distant_Evaluation	Ambassador to Britain Woody Johnson said on Twitter the United States stood with Britain in holding Russia accountable for its “act of aggression”.

Distant_Evaluation	“REMARKABLY SOPHISTICATED”
Distant_Evaluation	The “remarkably sophisticated” attack appeared to be a clear assassination attempt, said Neil Basu, head of UK counter terrorism policing.
Cause_Specific	He described an investigation which involved 250 detectives and analysis of some 11,000 hours of video.
Cause_Specific	According to police, the suspects, both around 40 years old, flew to London from Moscow on March 2.
Cause_Specific	They spent two nights in an east London hotel, making two day trips to Salisbury, the first for reconnaissance, the second to kill Skripal.
Cause_Specific	They flew out on March 4, hours after the Skripals were found unconscious.
Cause_Specific	Security cameras filmed the suspects near Skripal’s house, and traces of Novichok were found in their London hotel room.
Main	The Russians were charged with conspiracy to murder Sergei Skripal and with the attempted murder of Skripal, his daughter and police officer Nick Bailey.
Main	They are also charged with illegal use and possession of a chemical weapon.
Distant_Evaluation	A European arrest warrant has been issued for them, but prosecutors said Britain would not ask Moscow to extradite Russian citizens because Russia’s constitution forbids it.
Distant_Evaluation	Basu said the Skripals were making a good recovery.
Cause_General	A woman near Salisbury, Dawn Sturgess, died in July and her partner Charlie Rowley fell ill after Rowley found a counterfeit bottle of Nina Ricci perfume in a charity collection box and brought it home.
Cause_General	It contained Novichok.
Distant_Evaluation	Basu said police had no doubt the events were linked, and were discussing charges over the Sturgess and Rowley case with prosecutors.

Distant_Evaluation	May said the Litvinenko case showed there was no point to demanding the Skripal suspects’ extradition.

Cause_General	Freeland said Canada is currently reviewing its sale of light armored vehicles to Saudi Arabia, and as that review is ongoing, no new arms permits are being issued.
Cause_General	She said that Canadian security officials have been in direct contact with Turkey regarding its investigation, information has been shared, and that the director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service has been to Turkey.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We believe that in naming people and in saying in the view of the government of Canada that someone is responsible for something so serious and so odious, it's very important to gather all the facts."
Distant_Evaluation	"It's very important to act and to speak only on the basis of real certainty,"" said the Canadian minister."
Cause_Specific	Khashoggi has been missing since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2.
Cause_Specific	"The Saudi authorities said Khashoggi died in a ""brawl"" in its consulate."
Cause_Specific	After releasing the results of its initial investigation, the Saudi Public Prosecution announced that 18 Saudis were arrested for their alleged connections with the killing.
Cause_Specific	The U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on 17 individuals over their alleged roles in the killing of Khashoggi last week, following U.S. State Department's decision in late October to revoke 21 Saudi suspects' visas.
Main_Consequence	The death toll from Wednesday's suicide bombings in Algeria rose by 10 on Thursday, to 33, and the police mounted a nationwide manhunt for those responsible for the attacks.
Main	Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, North Africa's most active terrorist group, claimed responsibility for the twin bombings, which were directed at the main government building in Algiers and at a police station east of the city.
Main_Consequence	More than 200 people were wounded.
Cause_General	It could have been even worse: the police found a third bomb in a Mercedes-Benz sedan near the home of Ali Tounsi, director general of the national police, according to witnesses and local press reports.
Cause_General	The bomb was defused.
Cause_General	It was apparently one of the bombs referred to on Islamist Web sites on Wednesday, which claimed that a third suicide bomber was attacking the Algerian headquarters of Interpol.
Cause_General	Interpol links police forces in 186 countries around the world.
Main_Consequence	The police set up checkpoints around Algiers and increased patrols on the outskirts, but the mood there had already darkened.
Distant_Evaluation	The French-language daily newspaper Liberté wrote that the attacks ''have wakened the demons of a violence we believed had been contained.''
Distant_Evaluation	Algeria has only recently emerged from the shadows of a brutal civil war, set off when the military canceled elections in 1992 that a fundamentalist Islamic party was poised to win.
Distant_Historical	The war, which wound down after a government amnesty in 1999, was marked by horrific massacres of men, women and children -- slitting throats was common-- that left deep scars in the national psyche.
Distant_Historical	A national reconciliation program last year sought to shut that history firmly in the past with a new amnesty for the remaining Islamist fighters and with the release of hundreds of former fighters from jail.
Distant_Historical	Even talking of the past atrocities became illegal.
Cause_General	A committed core of Islamists kept up the fight, but most Algerians were confident that the movement had been defeated, as repeated government pronouncements claimed.
Distant_Evaluation	Islamists warned otherwise, however.
Distant_Historical	''When you leave a small fire burning, it can spread,'' Abdelhak Layada, a founder of the Armed Islamic Group, said in an interview last June, shortly after he was freed under the reconciliation program.
Distant_Historical	The Armed Islamic Group was a precursor to the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, which announced an alliance with Al Qaeda last year and recently changed its name to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
Cause_General	The bombings took place on the fifth anniversary of a deadly truck bombing at El Ghriba Synagogue in Djerba, Tunisia, for which the Salafists claimed responsibility.
Distant_Historical	Twenty-one people died in that attack.
Distant_Evaluation	Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb continues to claim that it does not attack ordinary Algerians, but Wednesday's bombings showed otherwise.
Cause_General	Many of the people who died were office workers or bystanders outside the government building.
Distant_Evaluation	People were quick to blame the government, saying lenience toward former rebels encouraged the movement and weakened the resolve of the army and the police.
Distant_Evaluation	''There's been a lack of vigilance on the part of the security forces,'' said Mahmoud Belhimeur, an editor at El Khabar newspaper.
Distant_Evaluation	''They said that it's over, but they forgot that these people operate best when it's calm.''

Main	GAZA, Oct. 29 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of outraged mourners buried on Monday three Palestinian children who were killed on Sunday night in an Israeli airstrike on the border area between eastern Khan Younis town in southern Gaza Strip and Israel.
Cause_General	Relatives, friends and neighbors joined the funeral of the three killed children: Khaled Abu Sa'eed, 14, Abdul Hamid Abu Dhaher, 13 and Mohamed al-Satari, 13.
Cause_General	The three children are residents of the village Wadi al-Salqaa east of the southern Gaza Strip town of Kham Younis.
Cause_General	The mourners took the bodies of the three children from al-Aqsa Hospital in the town of Deir el-Ballah, carried their bodies on their shoulders amid chanting of Allaho Akbar (God is Great).
Distant_Evaluation	Ibrahim al-Satari, 45 years old, father of Mohamed al-Satari, said with grief that the last ever thing he expected is to hear that his 13-year-old kid gets killed by a missile fired from a warplane.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This shows how brutal the Israeli army is and shows that this army has no morality, because armies of countries don't kill children,"" said the father as he stood near the body of his son for a last glance together with his wife and four children as well as relatives and neighbors."

Main	MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - The Minneapolis police officer who fatally shot an unarmed Australian woman last July was arrested on Tuesday on charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, prosecutors said.
Cause_General	Mohamed Noor, 32, turned himself in and was arrested for the death of Justine Damond, 40, who had called 911 about a possible sexual assault near her house, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said at a news conference announcing the charges.
Distant_Evaluation	“There is no evidence that Officer Noor encountered a threat, appreciated a threat, investigated a threat or confirmed a threat that justified his decision to use deadly force,” Freeman said.
Distant_Historical	“Instead, Officer Noor recklessly and intentionally fired his handgun.”
Distant_Historical	After Noor shot her, Damond put her hands on the gunshot wound on the left side of her abdomen and said, “I’m dying” or “I’m dead,” Freeman said.
Distant_Evaluation	The shooting drew condemnation in Minnesota and Australia, where Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called it “shocking” and “inexplicable.” Then-Minneapolis police chief Jamee Harteau resigned after city officials said procedures had been violated and Damond “didn’t have to die.”
Cause_Specific	The third-degree murder charge accused Noor of committing an “eminently dangerous act” and showing a “depraved mind,” and the second-degree manslaughter charge cited “culpable negligence creating unreasonable risk,” the records showed.
Cause_General	The penalty for third-degree murder is up to 25 years in prison and second-degree manslaughter carries a penalty of up to 10 years, according to a state website.
Distant_Historical	Freeman, Minneapolis’ top prosecutor, had delayed his decision in December, saying his office needed more time and that he lacked sufficient evidence to charge Noor.

Cause_General	Noor has been on paid leave and refused to be interviewed by Minnesota state investigators.
Distant_Evaluation	Noor’s attorney, Tom Plunkett, said his client should not be charged.
Distant_Evaluation	“The loss of Justine Ruszczyk Damond is a tragedy and Officer Noor again personally extends his continued condolences to her family for their loss,” Plunkett said in a statement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“The facts will show that Officer Noor acted as he has been trained and consistent with established departmental policy,” Plunkett added.
Distant_Evaluation	“Officer Noor should not have been charged with any crime.”
Distant_Evaluation	‘INIQUITOUS ACT’
Distant_Evaluation	Damond’s fiance, Don Damond, and her father, John Ruszczyk, issued a joint statement in which they praised the decision to charge Noor and hoped it resulted in a conviction, calling it “one step toward justice for this iniquitous act.”
Distant_Evaluation	“No charges can bring our Justine back.
Distant_Evaluation	However, justice demands accountability for those responsible for recklessly killing the fellow citizens they are sworn to protect,” they said in the statement.
Distant_Historical	Damond, who was living in Minneapolis and engaged to be married, approached the police after their arrival, authorities have said.
Distant_Historical	She had owned a meditation and life-coaching company.
Distant_Historical	Neither Noor, who came to the United States from Somalia as a child, nor Matthew Harrity, another officer in the patrol car, had their body cameras activated, police have said.

Main	COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish inventor Peter Madsen was sentenced to life in prison on Wednesday for murdering, sexually mutilating and dismembering a Swedish female journalist with premeditation aboard his home-made submarine in Copenhagen harbor in 2017.
Cause_General	Madsen, dressed entirely in black, sat motionless as the Copenhagen City Court handed down its verdict in a grisly case straight from the pages of a dark Scandinavian psycho-thriller.
Distant_Historical	Already well known in Denmark for his submarines and his plan to send a human into space in a home-made rocket, Madsen was detained last August when he emerged from his submarine without Wall, a 30-year-old who was researching a piece on him.
Distant_Historical	Later that month, police identified a torso washed ashore in Copenhagen as Wall’s.
Distant_Historical	Her arms, legs and head were found later.
Cause_General	Madsen changed his version of events several times, finally arguing that Wall had been suffocated by an accidental gas leak.
Distant_Historical	But forensic tests found that she had either been strangled or had her throat cut - and that around the time of her death, Madsen had stabbed her in her breasts and genitals with a knife or screwdriver.
Cause_Specific	Judge Anette Burkoe said the panel of judges had been unanimous in finding him guilty of a murder that had been planned.
Distant_Evaluation	During the trial, a police prosecutor said images of women being strangled and decapitated, “which we presumed to be real”, had been found on Madsen’s computer in a laboratory he ran.
Distant_Historical	Wall was a freelance journalist whose work had appeared in Harper’s Magazine, Time, the New York Times, the Atlantic Magazine, the Guardian, Foreign Policy and the South China Morning Post.

Distant_Historical	“HE BROUGHT COFFEE AND COOKIES”
Distant_Historical	Wall had been writing an article for the U.S. magazine Wired on Madsen’s race against another Danish group to be the first to send a person into space in a home-made rocket, her boyfriend told the court during the trial.
Distant_Historical	Wall had split her time between New York and Beijing, and was planning to move to China with her boyfriend less than a week after the fatal trip.
Distant_Historical	Poignantly, she sent him unsuspecting text messages on the evening she was meeting Madsen, reading: “I’m still alive btw”, “But going down now”, “I love you!!
Distant_Historical	!”, “He brought coffee and cookies too”.
Distant_Evaluation	Wall’s closest relatives were not present in court; her mother had previously said: “She gave a voice to the weak, the vulnerable and marginalized people.
Distant_Evaluation	That voice would have been needed for a long, long time.
Distant_Evaluation	Now, that won’t be.”
Cause_General	Madsen, 47, admitted to dismembering the body and throwing it off his 17-metre (56-ft) submarine, but denied murder.
Cause_General	But the court found that he had dismembered the body to conceal the evidence of the killing.
Distant_Historical	He was also found to have committed “sexual assault without intercourse” in relation to the 14 interior and exterior stab wounds found on Wall’s genitals.
Distant_Evaluation	Forensic tests did not support Madsen’s claim that Wall had suffocated, and the judge said the explanation was not credible and “not consistent with the subsequent decision to dismember the body”.

Main	MANILA (Reuters) - Motorcycle-borne gunmen on Tuesday assassinated a mayor in a town north of the Philippine capital, the second such killing of an official in two days, police said.
Cause_General	Ferdinand Bote, 57, became the 12th elected local official murdered since President Rodrigo Duterte unleashed a deadly anti-narcotics campaign after coming to power two years ago, although Bote was not linked to the drug trade.
Cause_Specific	He and his driver were leaving a government office in the capital of Nueva Ecija province when gunmen approached his sport utility vehicle and shot him dead, said Adrian Gabriel, the town’s police chief.
Cause_Specific	“He was repeatedly shot with the use of a short firearm,” police said in an initial report, but the driver escaped unhurt.
Cause_General	Police retrieved at least 18 empty shells at the scene.
Distant_Evaluation	The government will spare no effort in getting to the bottom of the latest crime, said Harry Roque, a spokesman for Duterte.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We assure everyone that we will discharge the state obligation for every murder,” Roque said in a statement, promising a fair and thorough investigation by police to bring the perpetrators to justice.
Cause_General	On Monday, Antonio Halili, 72, who had gained prominence in 2016 for parading drug suspects in the streets of Tanauan, south of Manila, was hit by a bullet in the chest while attending a weekly flag-raising ceremony.
Distant_Evaluation	Duterte said the mayor may have had some drug involvement and his “walk of shame” campaign to parade suspects was a ploy to convince police he was not engaged in the illegal drug trade.
Distant_Evaluation	At Halili’s wake, his daughter Angeline told reporters it was unfair to link her father to the drug trade, and said Duterte had been misinformed.
Distant_Evaluation	“I can’t blame the president,” she added.
Distant_Evaluation	“If that’s always what you hear from the same people that you talk to — and they keep telling you the same thing — it gets in your system to the point that you believe it, even though it’s a lie.”
Distant_Historical	Halili had been stripped of his supervisory powers over police in October 2017, due to a proliferation of illegal drugs in his city, amid allegations by the national police that he may have been involved.
Distant_Historical	Halili had denied the allegations.
Cause_General	Police have killed more than 4,200 people in the anti-narcotics campaign since July 2016, with another 2,500 suspected drug suspects killed by unknown assailants over the same period.
Distant_Evaluation	Human rights advocates said the victims were executed by the police, who have denied the accusations, saying most of the killings were done in self-defense.

Main	NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former U.S. Army sergeant and two other U.S. citizens were found guilty by a jury in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday of taking part in a plot to murder a woman in the Philippines for money, prosecutors said.
Cause_Specific	Ex-soldier Joseph Manuel Hunter, Adam Samia and Carl David Stillwell were convicted of charges including murder-for-hire, which carries a mandatory life sentence, according to the office of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan.
Distant_Evaluation	“Obviously, we’re disappointed, but respect the jury’s verdict,” said Robert Ray, a lawyer for Stillwell, adding he planned to appeal.
Cause_General	Lawyers for Hunter and Samia could not immediately be reached for comment.
Cause_General	Hunter, 52, is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams on Sep. 7.
Cause_General	He is already serving a 20-year sentence after pleading guilty in 2015 to separate charges of conspiring to kill a federal drug agent and an informant.
Cause_General	Samia, 43, and Stillwell, 50, are scheduled to be sentenced by Abrams on Sep. 14.
Cause_General	Samia is a self-described “personal protection/security industry” professional trained in tactics and weapons, while Stillwell’s resume says he worked at a North Carolina firm that provides firearms training, according to court filings.
Distant_Historical	Prosecutors said Samia and Stillwell traveled to the Philippines and murdered a woman there in February 2012, and were each paid $35,000 by Hunter.
Distant_Historical	The woman was shot multiple times in the face and left on a pile of garbage, prosecutors said.
Distant_Historical	The first charges against Hunter stemmed from a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration sting operation that followed the arrest in Liberia in 2012 of Hunter’s boss, Paul Le Roux, the Zimbabwe-born head of a multinational criminal organization.
Distant_Historical	Le Roux subsequently agreed to cooperate with authorities.
Distant_Historical	He admitted to shipping drugs and weapons around the world and to having ordered various murders, and ordered a fake murder-for-hire operation to help authorities catch Hunter, according to court records.
Main	BLANTYRE, Malawi (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The latest murder of a man with albinism in Malawi - the 22nd in four years - has sparked calls for their killers to be executed to deter a wave of attacks in the poor southern African nation.
Cause_Specific	The dismembered corpse of 22-year-old McDonald Masambuka was found buried in southern Malawi several weeks after he went missing in March.
Cause_Specific	Several body parts were missing.
Cause_General	A Catholic priest, police officer and medical officer are among 11 people facing charges of conspiracy and murder, police spokesman James Kadadzera told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
Distant_Evaluation	Information minister Nicholas Dausi said international rights groups and donors were preventing the government from using the death penalty to deter such crimes in Malawi, where people with albinism are hunted down for their body parts.
Distant_Evaluation	“They are stopping us from enforcing capital punishment,” Dausi was quoted by local media as saying at Masambuka’s funeral last month.
Distant_Evaluation	“Yet in their countries they execute murderers.
Distant_Evaluation	Is this fair?”
Cause_General	Malawi is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for people with albinism - a lack of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes - who are targeted so that their body parts can be used in magical potions and other ritual practices.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The United Nations’ top expert on albinism has said people with the condition risk “extinction” in Malawi due to relentless attacks fueled by superstitions.
Cause_General	President Peter Mutharika has since said Malawi should have an “honest debate” about whether to apply the death sentence to those found guilty of murdering people with albinism.
Distant_Historical	Malawi suspended capital punishment more than 20 years ago as it embraced democratic reforms.
Cause_General	Although the death penalty still exists in law, it has been declared unconstitutional.
Cause_General	MURDERS
Distant_Evaluation	But rights groups said the focus on the death penalty was misplaced and the government should step up its efforts to investigate unsolved murders and protect people with albinism.
Distant_Evaluation	“We never have any experience where the death penalty has been successful as a deterrent,” said Overstone Kondowe, head of the Association of People with Albinism in Malawi (APAM), which helps about 3,400 people with the condition.
Cause_General	It has recorded 146 attacks in Malawi since 2014.
Cause_General	About one in 20,000 people worldwide have the congenital disorder, with higher rates in sub-Saharan Africa.
Cause_General	Only five of 22 murders reported since 2014 are in court, said Kondowe, with 17 unsolved.
Distant_Evaluation	“We don’t have even have a suspect and nobody has been prosecuted,” he said of the 17 cases, adding that the police should reopen them now that they have better equipment.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We didn’t have facilities of DNA testing to help with the investigation, so we’re seeking that because the current capacity can help to shed light on who was responsible.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Rights groups called on the government to establish a commission of inquiry to find out who is behind the attacks, amid claims that they are organized by criminal gangs.
Distant_Evaluation	“There is a green light with the recent case where we have seen high profile people involved,” said Timothy Mtambo, who heads the Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation, a charity.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We believe a good investigation can open up our windows as to who is behind the trade ... We would be able to say we have unveiled the market and done (away) with the roots.”
Distant_Evaluation	Mtambo also echoed a United Nations’ call on the government to implement its own plan to strengthen protection measures, including buying sturdy locks for poor families at risk of attack, and for public education to eradicate superstitions.
Distant_Evaluation	“It should invest in preventative measures, not ‘curing’ the problem,” he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“It needs to understand where we have people with albinism, which can help in drawing security plans.
Distant_Evaluation	Currently there is no proper program.”

Main	FARAH, Afghanistan, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- About 15 police personnel have been killed in fierce clashes in two Afghan western provinces as fighting rages elsewhere in the country, authorities said Monday.
Main	In one attack, five police officers, including a senior police officer, were killed after Taliban attacked a police base on outskirts of Qala-e-Naw city, capital of Badghis province, a provincial police officer told Xinhua anonymously.
Cause_General	Several militants were also killed and wounded during the gun battle which occurred early Monday morning, but their number could not be exactly specified as the militants evacuated their casualties after the fighting, the source said.
Main	In Farah province, bordering Iran, 10 police officers were killed after clashes flared up in Gajgin village of Pusht Rod district, north of provincial capital Farah city Sunday night.
Cause_General	The Taliban seized weapons and ammunition after attacking security checkpoints in the area before destroying the posts and two police officers went missing after the fighting, according to a provincial source.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“There is no democracy without a free press ... We expect a swift and thorough investigation to bring those responsible to justice,” the European Commission, the European Union’s executive said in a tweet.
Cause_General	Bulgaria ranked 111 out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index this year, lower than any other EU member.
Cause_General	While there has been no link established to her work so far, the killing has angered and upset many in a country where people are frustrated with rampant corruption and an inefficient and graft-prone judiciary, for which Sofia has been repeatedly rapped by the European Commission.
Cause_General	On her last aired TV show, on Sept. 30, Marinova introduced two journalists who were investigating alleged corruption involving EU funds.
Distant_Evaluation	She said the regional current affairs show, “Detector”, would do similar investigations.
Cause_General	Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov said a bank transfer of 14 million euros ($16.06 million) had been frozen as part of a pre-trial investigation into issues raised by the investigative journalists on the show but declined to give further details.
Distant_Evaluation	“There is no way that I can believe that this killing is random, after it happened just few days after the show that featured such massive misuse of funds.
Distant_Evaluation	I am glad so many people are here,” said Stoyka Panagonova, a mother of three, at the vigil in Ruse.
Cause_General	The European anti-fraud office OLAF declined to comment on the killing.
Distant_Evaluation	But its press office said it was “aware of allegations concerning possible misuse of EU funds in Bulgaria that have been brought to light by journalists in recent weeks”.
Cause_General	Marinova’s appearance on “Detector” was the first time she had anchored the show on Ruse-based TV station TVN - a popular channel in northeastern Bulgaria.
Cause_General	Previously, she was best known for presenting a regional lifestyle show and was not a household name nationally.
Cause_General	CANDLES LIT
Distant_Evaluation	Interior Minister Mladen Marinov has said that there was no evidence to suggest a link to Marinova’s work as journalist so far - something echoed by police and prosecutors.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are working on all possible motives and we do not exclude any,” Marinov told reporters on Monday in Ruse, Bulgaria’s main Danube river port city.
Cause_General	He said no match had been found so far for DNA collected from the crime scene, which was close to a psychiatric clinic.
Distant_Evaluation	Police and prosecutors said they were working on three possible motives - whether Marinova was a victim of a random attack by a person with a mental disorder, a planned attack or whether the crime was linked to her personal life.
Cause_General	Marinova would be the third journalist murdered in the European Union over the past 12 months.
Distant_Historical	Daphne Caruana Galizia, Malta’s best-known investigative reporter, was killed when a bomb blew up her car in October last year and Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak was shot dead in February.

Distant_Historical	Sadr, whose militiamen staged violent uprisings against U.S. forces after the 2003 invasion, has in the past mobilised tens of thousands of people to press his demands.
Distant_Evaluation	Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most influential cleric in Iraq, has also expressed solidarity with the demonstrators.
Cause_General	Protests have swept cities in the south, Iraq’s Shi’ite heartland.

Cause_Specific	Mireille Knoll, 85, was found dead with 11 stab wounds at her apartment in a working class area of the capital on Friday.
Cause_Specific	The apartment was set on fire after the attack.
Cause_General	One of the suspects was a long-time neighbor who recently finished a jail sentence for a sex offense, the victim’s son Daniel Knoll told i24 News, an Israeli channel.
Cause_Specific	He said the neighbor had spent much of Friday, when the Jewish day of rest begins at sundown, chatting with his mother at the apartment, with the two sharing a drink.
Cause_General	According to the judicial source, the arrested men were notified by a judge that they are suspected of murder motivated by the victim’s “real or supposed adherence to a religion”, as well as aggravated theft and damage to property.
Distant_Evaluation	President Emmanuel Macron described the death as a horrific crime.
Distant_Evaluation	“I reaffirm my total determination in fighting anti-Semitism,” he wrote on Twitter late on Monday.
Distant_Evaluation	Interior Minister Gerard Collomb said the murder underscored how far France still had to go to combat anti-Semitism.
Distant_Evaluation	“Since the start of the year, no fewer than 33 anti-Semitic acts have been committed,” he told the Senate.
Distant_Evaluation	“This cancer cannot be allowed to eat away at our nation.”
Cause_General	Mireille Knoll had lived in the neighborhood - in the building where she died and another on the same street - for 60 years, said Francis Kalifat, head of Crif, a body that represents France’s 400,000-strong Jewish community.
Cause_General	Knoll - who narrowly escaped being rounded up with around 13,000 Jews who were held at a cycling track in Paris in July 1942 before being deported to Auschwitz - had known the suspect since he was seven years old, he added.
Distant_Anecdotal	One source close to the investigation told Reuters the two arrested men had given conflicting accounts to police.
Distant_Anecdotal	One told interrogators he heard the other shout the words “God is greatest” in Arabic during the attack.
Cause_General	The second suspect is a homeless man, according to Gilles-William Goldnadel, the victim’s lawyer.
Distant_Evaluation	Daniel Knoll said his mother suffered from Parkinson’s disease and was not aware that her neighbor had spent time in jail for molesting the 12-year-old daughter of a woman who acted as her live-in carer.
Cause_General	France’s Jewish community, the largest in Europe, has complained for years of a rise in anti-Semitic hate crimes.
Distant_Historical	In 2015, vandals desecrated 250 tombstones in a Jewish cemetery in eastern France only days after four Jews were killed in an attack on a kosher grocery in Paris.
Distant_Historical	Knoll’s killing took place a year to the day after the murder of Sarah Halimi-Attal, a 65-year-old whose killing prosecutors believe was anti-Semitic.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	France’s chief rabbi on Monday described Knoll’s death as a “horror” and Jewish leaders called for a march in her memory, which is set to take place on Wednesday evening.
Main	LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - California law enforcement officials on Friday offered a $50,000 reward to help crack the 1991 murders of an aspiring crime scene investigator and her family, hoping to capitalize on advances in DNA technology and publicity surrounding another high-profile case.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In announcing a new push to solve the 27-year-old killings of state employee Marcy Jacobs, her husband and her daughter, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn said they hoped new witnesses would come forward.
Distant_Evaluation	“Over the years, this case has been very challenging for multiple investigators.
Distant_Evaluation	Due to forensic advances, detectives working with the California Department of Justice have again begun actively working this case,” Hahn said in a statement.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We are hoping with the passage of time, and the offer of a $50,000 reward, anyone who has information regarding this incident will come forward to help solve this extremely violent crime,” Hahn said.
Distant_Evaluation	DNA evidence was collected from the crime scene at the Jacobs’ Sacramento home, but police declined to say if investigators were employing techniques similar to those used in the separate “Golden State Killer” case to try to identify a culprit.
Cause_General	Former police officer Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, was arrested in April and charged with 12 murders in the 1970s and 1980s attributed to the long-elusive Golden State Killer.
Cause_General	DeAngelo was identified as a suspect after detectives compared DNA from several crime scenes to online DNA-genealogy data, finding a partial match in a distant relative.
Distant_Evaluation	Some experts have raised ethical questions about use by law enforcement of consumer genealogy websites.
Distant_Evaluation	Authorities do not believe there is a link between the Jacobs case and the Golden State Killer murders.
Distant_Historical	Marcy Jacobs, a 31-year-old California Department of Justice staff services employee, was attending night classes to become a crime scene investigator when she was found dead at her home on Jan. 14, 1991, along with her husband Michael, 33, and daughter Jenny, 9.
Distant_Evaluation	“Obviously there have been advancements in that (DNA) area, also relationships change over time,” public information officer Vance Chandler of the California Department of Justice said in reference to the Jacobs case, declining to elaborate.
Distant_Evaluation	Detectives have long believed that the murders were carried out by more than one suspect who came to the home seeking valuables stored in a safe there by a friend of Michael Jacobs.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“We call on the public to help bring their killers to justice,” Becerra said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“We owe the Jacobs family and all their loved ones nothing less.”
Cause_General	For 17 years, David B. Dahlstrom, a locksmith in Salt Lake City, has not been entirely himself.
Cause_Specific	That is because, the authorities here say, Yorck A. Rogge, a German immigrant in Los Angeles, has been him, too.
Cause_General	The real Mr. Dahlstrom, 45, had lived a relatively uneventful life with his wife until Mr. Rogge entered the picture, prosecutors said.
Cause_Specific	Mr. Rogge, 41, who was first arrested using Mr. Dahlstrom's name in 1990, has committed a string of crimes under it, the authorities said, and is in a state prison for violating parole after being charged with stealing a car and assaulting his girlfriend last year.
Distant_Evaluation	Prosecutors in Los Angeles want to keep him there.
Main	The city attorney's office filed charges on Wednesday against Mr. Rogge, accusing him of 81 counts of identity theft and fraud.
Distant_Evaluation	The case illustrates the tangled trail identity theft can leave, said Rocky Delgadillo, the city attorney, although he called this one ''extraordinary'' both for the duration of the fraud and the number of crimes traced to Mr. Rogge under his assumed name.
Distant_Historical	As a result, Mr. Delgadillo said, Mr. Dahlstrom has had difficulty getting credit and at one point was detained by police officers serving an arrest warrant in his name.
Distant_Evaluation	''This certainly demonstrates the kind of nightmare identity theft victims can suffer,'' said Mr. Delgadillo, whose office last year established a special unit of four prosecutors to investigate identity theft, a problem federal authorities say has grown considerably in the past decade.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Dahlstrom said the ordeal had left him feeling ''violated and confused.''
Distant_Evaluation	''Me and my wife have been stressed,'' he added, ''my credit has gone downhill.
Distant_Evaluation	I cannot believe it happened to me.''
Distant_Historical	Mr. Dahlstrom told the authorities that in 1985 he lost his wallet in Utah.
Distant_Historical	The wallet contained his birth certificate, Social Security card and driver's license.
Distant_Historical	Prosecutors said Mr. Rogge used Mr. Dahlstrom's identity in 1990, when he was arrested and convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol in Los Angeles.
Distant_Historical	From 1990 until last year, Mr. Rogge was convicted of a series of crimes using Mr. Dahlstrom's identity.
Distant_Historical	Vandalism in 1994.
Distant_Historical	Burglary in 1995.
Distant_Historical	Leaving an accident scene in 2001.
Distant_Historical	Making a bomb threat in 2004.
Distant_Historical	For much of that time Mr. Rogge had a California driver's license in Mr. Dahlstrom's name.
Cause_General	Prosecutors are trying to learn when it was first issued and how.
Distant_Evaluation	Jerry Baik, a deputy city attorney, said defendants' records of previous arrests often lists aliases, but the police and prosecutors focusing on the crime of the moment rarely check the aliases against stolen identities.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Dahlstrom, meanwhile, first became aware his identity had been stolen when he was denied a credit card in 1997 because of what a creditor called ''fraudulent activity.''
Distant_Historical	In 1998, he received an insurance claim for an accident he was not involved in and another claim a few years after that.
Distant_Historical	When he reported the trouble to the authorities in Utah they referred him to the police in Los Angeles, where the incidents occurred.
Distant_Historical	The Los Angeles police, he said, cautioned him that unless he had the true name of a suspect little could be done.
Distant_Evaluation	Problems mounted.
Distant_Historical	Last year, the police in Utah told him there was a warrant for his arrest, and Mr. Dahlstrom called the Los Angeles city attorney's office pleading for help.
Distant_Evaluation	Ultimately, there were some lucky breaks.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Rogge's girlfriend, in a pique of anger, divulged his true name to a parole officer last year, who called Mr. Dahlstrom, who called the city attorney's office, starting a deeper investigation.
Distant_Historical	Investigators determined the fingerprints of the two Mr. Dahlstroms did not match.
Distant_Historical	From marriage license records, they established that Mr. Rogge was a German citizen, later confirmed by the German authorities, and investigators said it appeared he had entered the United States illegally.
Distant_Historical	A check of criminal records showed the streak of crimes Mr. Rogge committed under Mr. Dahlstrom's name, the authorities said, while Mr. Dahlstrom has struggled to clear up the bad credit prosecutors say Mr. Rogge left him.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Delgadillo said his office would issue documents to help Mr. Dahlstrom with creditors.
Cause_General	Mr. Baik said that Mr. Rogge, who was arrested in prison, had not been assigned a lawyer, pending his arraignment next week.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If convicted on all the counts, he could be given a sentence totaling 31 years, but the maximum penalty is rarely given.
Cause_General	The city attorney's office, which prosecutes misdemeanors, is considering turning the case over to the district attorney's office, which could file felony charges leading to a stiffer sentence.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There may be yet another twist in the case.
Cause_General	Prosecutors are trying to determine whether the Mr. Rogge in custody is the same Yorck Rogge who, according to an article in The Los Angeles Times at the time, was honored by a San Fernando Valley civic group in 1987 for helping chase a purse snatcher.

Cause_General	"Four members of his family have been detained since Tuesday and three members of his close circle,"" Heitz said."
Cause_General	The 29-year-old man had been on police watchlist as he developed radical religious tendencies while he was in jail.
Distant_Historical	He had been convicted several times in France, Germany and Switzerland for common law offenses, including violence and robberies.
Cause_General	"A statement released Thursday on the Islamic State (IS) website claimed that Chekatt is one of its soldiers who ""carried out the operation in response to calls for targeting citizens of coalition countries."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Attending the reopening of the Christmas market in Strasbourg on Friday, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner described the terrorist group's claim as ""totally opportunistic""."

Distant_Evaluation	"There is nothing to suggest that he was being protected by such, but the investigation is not yet over."""
Cause_General	Following the assault on Tuesday, France has raised its security threat level to the highest and poured additional 1,800 security forces across its cities to guarantee security in Christmas markets and for year-end holidays.

Main	GAZA, Sept. 21 (Xinhua) -- At least one Palestinian was killed and 312 were injured on Friday in clashes in eastern Gaza Strip bordering Israel, the health ministry said.
Main	Gaza Health Ministry Spokesman Ashraf al-Qedra said that the clashes between hundreds of Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers have killed a Palestinian young man in his 20s and injured 159, among which 33 were hit by gunshots.
Cause_Specific	On Friday, thousands of Palestinian protesters joined the 26th Friday of the marches of return to break the Israeli siege, which started on March 30 in eastern Gaza Strip that borders Israel.
Cause_Specific	The protesters burned tires, waved Palestinian flags, chanted slogans against Israel and threw stones at Israeli soldiers stationed on the border.
Cause_Specific	The soldiers fired back with tear gas and gunshots.
Cause_Specific	The protesters also managed to cut the barbed wire of the border fence, get into Israel and burn tires in front of the Israeli army lookout posts at the border.
Cause_Specific	According to Israeli media, they also released dozens of arson balloons from eastern Gaza Strip into Israel causing large fires in various agricultural fields in the area.
Cause_Specific	The Israeli media also said that Palestinian activists threw homemade hand grenades at the soldiers on the border, lightly injuring an Israeli soldier.
Cause_Specific	Palestinian security officials in Gaza said that the Israeli army targeted three separate Islamic Hamas movement military posts close to the border with Israeli drones missiles and artillery bombs, no injuries reported.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Yehya Sinwar, top Gaza leader of Islamic Hamas movement, said Friday that the marches of return to defy the Israeli blockade will continue until it succeeds.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We will carry on with the marches of return until we achieve the goals of lifting the siege,"" Sinwar told Palestinian protesters in eastern Gaza city as he joined the weekly march."
Distant_Evaluation	"He slammed the Palestinian Authority for its security coordination and cooperation with Israel, saying ""we are backing our people until they achieve their goals, and those who bit on security coordination with Israel are the losers."""

Cause_General	Efforts by Egypt and UN Special Coordinator Nickolay Mladenov have so far failed to broker a cease-fire agreement between Israel and the Hamas-led militant groups in the Gaza Strip.
Main	Italy's fragile government, under fire for making a deal to free an Italian journalist in Afghanistan, on Thursday proposed international standards for confronting the rising number of high-profile kidnappings in war zones.
Cause_Specific	The Italian move came as new appeals went out for Alan Johnston, the BBC reporter kidnapped at gunpoint in Gaza a month ago.
Distant_Evaluation	In New York, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, called for Mr. Johnston's release, saying that freedom of the press should be protected ''as a matter of principle.''
Cause_General	There has been no word from Mr. Johnston, 44, since he disappeared on March 12.
Distant_Evaluation	On Thursday, however, a Palestinian official, Saeb Erekat, said the government ''has been reassured by many sources that Mr. Johnston is alive.''
Cause_General	Hostage-taking has long been a threat in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, though concerns have recently risen on several fronts.
Cause_General	Among them was the two-week detention of 15 British sailors and marines by Iran, which accused them of trespassing in its national waters.
Cause_General	All were released unharmed last week, amid allegations, denied by Britain, that an exchange was made for an Iranian diplomat arrested in Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	Here in Italy, the government has faced criticism at home and abroad for pressuring the Afghan government to release five Taliban prisoners for Daniele Mastrogiacomo, a reporter for La Repubblica, kidnapped last month.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The United States, Britain and other nations contended that the deal would encourage more kidnappings.
Cause_Specific	Inside Italy, that criticism rose on Sunday after Mr. Mastrogiacomo's Afghan interpreter, Ajmal Naqshbandi, was killed by the Taliban, which were demanding the release of two other prisoners.
Distant_Evaluation	On Thursday, Massimo D'Alema, foreign minister for Italy's center-left government, strongly defended the deal to free Mr. Mastrogiacomo.
Distant_Evaluation	''We acted on the basis of one criterion: that of giving priority to the safety of the hostages,'' he said in a speech to the lower house of Parliament.
Distant_Evaluation	''This is an established principle, used over the years by various governments and always supported.''
Distant_Evaluation	In this case, he said, Italy had been tricked, because it believed that the trade for Mr. Mastrogiacomo had included Mr. Naqshbandi as well.
Distant_Evaluation	More generally, he said he believed that there should always be room for negotiation if it would save a hostage's life.
Main	''At the same time, I think it's time to explore the possibility of guidelines shared on an international level, a code of shared behavior,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''I think, for example, in the case of Afghanistan, of a discussion at NATO.''
Distant_Evaluation	Center-right opposition leaders have accused the government of putting undue pressure on the Afghan government to swap the prisoners, and for caring more about the life of an Italian journalist than his Afghan interpreter.
Cause_Specific	Mr. Mastrogiacomo's driver was also killed, shortly after he was kidnapped in southern Afghanistan.
Distant_Evaluation	In the West Bank city of Ramallah, the BBC's director general, Mark Thompson, said at a news conference that he had met with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, on Wednesday evening to discuss Mr. Johnston, and that Mr. Abbas had told him there was ''credible evidence'' that Mr. Johnston was safe and well.
Cause_General	In Gaza City, Palestinian journalists rallied for Mr. Johnston's release, and they drove a convoy of cars through the city's streets.
Distant_Historical	About 18 foreign journalists and aid workers have been kidnapped in Gaza in the past year, but most have been released unharmed, within hours or days.

Main	BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Three people have been charged in Slovakia’s with the premeditated murder of investigative reporter Jan Kuciak and his fiancee, which sparked nationwide protests and brought down the government.
Cause_General	Kuciak had, among other things, investigated fraud involving businessmen with Slovak political ties, and the suspected mafia links of Italians with businesses in Slovakia.
Distant_Historical	A prosecutor said in March the murder was likely to have been a contract killing related to Kuciak’s work.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The state prosecutor was due to ask a judge to allow the suspects to be held in custody, the spokeswoman for the state prosecutor’s office said in an emailed statement.
Cause_General	The suspects were detained in a house raid on Thursday morning.
Cause_General	Five others detained in the same raid were released, the spokeswoman added.
Cause_General	Kuciak’s final story, published posthumously, reported on an Italian living in Slovakia with past business links to two Slovaks who later worked in the office of then-prime minister Robert Fico.
Distant_Evaluation	Both of the Slovaks resigned, but deny connections to the murder.
Distant_Evaluation	Their Italian former business partner has also denied having connections with the mafia and the murder, but was detained on a European drug trafficking warrant in March and extradited to Italy in May.
Distant_Historical	Weeks of public protests in March eventually forced the departure of the long-serving Fico and his interior minister, Robert Kalinak, as well as police chief Tibor Gaspar.
Cause_General	However, Fico’s three-party coalition has remained in power under Prime Minister Peter Pellegrini, who comes from the Smer party, which Fico still heads.

Main	The arrests were made on Tuesday in Mpumalanga Province by the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation, also known as the Hawks, in cooperation with other law enforcement agencies, according to the South African Police Service (SAPS).
Main	The suspects, aged between 30 and 56, include two alleged syndicate leaders, two police officers and a former cop, SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said.
Main_Consequence	They appeared at the White River Magistrate's Court in Mpumalanga on Wednesday afternoon, facing charges of theft, conspiracy to commit a crime, illegal buying and selling of rhino horns, corruption and money laundering, said Mulaudzi.
Cause_Specific	The syndicate members allegedly ran poaching groups with the support of corrupt police officials as well as authorities from the private game farms, Mulaudzi said.
Distant_Evaluation	The expeditious internal disciplinary processes are already underway for the arrested police officers, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	The logistical, transport and communication support of the criminal group was well managed and controlled and allegedly succeeded in moving rhino horns from the protected areas to places where the transactions would take place, Mulaudzi disclosed.
Distant_Evaluation	The illegal transactions were also protected by alleged corrupt officials to ensure no detection from law enforcement, he said.
Distant_Historical	The significant breakthrough followed Project Broadbill, an investigative operation launched by the Hawks in January last year, Mulaudzi said.
Cause_General	The operation focused on the criminal supply chain of poached rhinos within the Kruger National Park and other state-owned or private reserves in Kwazulu Natal and Gauteng provinces.
Distant_Evaluation	Lieutenant General Godfrey Lebeya, the National Head of the Hawks, lauded the collaborative action as a huge success in the fight against rhino poaching in the country.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We have often been seized with picking up the remains of endangered species and not finding and arresting the poachers and traffickers behind the crime."
Distant_Evaluation	"""The operation spells hope for rhinos and other endangered species and we are fully committed to eradicating poaching and trafficking,"" he said."
Cause_General	Lebeya vowed to continue teaming up with key enforcement partners and government departments in carrying out crucial investigations and arresting those behind the slaughter of the wildlife.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The operation is still proceeding, and more seizures and possible arrests are expected, he said.
Distant_Historical	South Africa, home to about 90 percent of the world's rhino population, bears the brunt of rhino poaching, losing 1,028 rhinos to poaching last year.
Distant_Evaluation	The government has warned that the country's rhino population will be close to extinction by 2026 if no effective measures are taken to curb rhino poaching.
Main	A powerful bomb blew up a passenger bus on Saturday, killing 11 people and wounding more than 40 others on the southern coast of Sri Lanka.
Cause_General	The bombing was the second in less than 24 hours.
Cause_General	The authorities are investigating the first blast, which killed six people and wounded 50 on Friday northeast of the capital, Colombo.
Distant_Evaluation	A government statement blamed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam for the explosions.
Distant_Evaluation	''The government believes that the L.T.T.E.
Distant_Evaluation	is attempting to divert attention from the continuous defeats they have been suffering at the hands of the security forces during the recent past,'' the statement said.
Distant_Evaluation	''The government reiterates that terror attacks will not deter its efforts to find a peaceful solution to the national problem or its counterterrorism measures to defeat terrorism.''
Cause_General	The rebels had no immediate comment.
Distant_Evaluation	They routinely deny involvement in attacks.
Cause_General	The Tigers have been fighting for more than two decades to carve out a separate state for the island's Tamil minority.
Cause_General	The bombing on Saturday took place near the busy town of Hikkaduwa, in an area that is popular with tourists.
Distant_Evaluation	The body of a woman who was believed to have planted the parcel bomb was found near the bus, said Jayantha Gamage, the senior police official in the area.
Main_Consequence	He said most of the damage and casualties were to the rear section of the bus, which bore a gaping hole.
Main	CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian prosecutors are investigating the death of a monk who was from the monastery where a bishop was murdered in July, a case that has rattled the biggest church in the Middle East.
Cause_Specific	Zenon al-Makari, 45, died while being rushed to hospital after suffering severe stomach pains.
Cause_General	He had served as a confessional priest for one of two defrocked monks charged with the murder of the Bishop Epiphanius on July 29, fellow monks said.
Distant_Evaluation	A Church spokesman said Zenon had suffered a “sudden health crisis” and prosecutors were investigating the cause of death.
Cause_General	Zenon was one of six monks that Coptic Church authorities had relocated away from the Abu Makar (Saint Macarius) Monastery some 110 km (70 miles) northwest of Cairo, a month after the murder there, on Aug. 25.
Distant_Evaluation	Monks at the al-Muhharaq Monastery in Assiut, where Zenon was transferred, said he had been distressed and declined to mix with other monks.
Cause_General	He was on a list of witnesses scheduled to testify in the trial of the two former monks, which opened last week, according to a lawyer involved in the trial and a security source in Beheira province, where the hearing is taking place.
Distant_Evaluation	The murder of Bishop Epiphanius had rocked the Church in a country where Christians make up an estimated 10 percent of the 96 million population.
Cause_General	Pope Tawadros immediately ordered a freeze on accepting new monks, a ban on monks leaving monasteries without permission, and a ban on clergy using social media.
Cause_General	Judicial sources said one of the monks accused of the killing, Wael Saad, known by his monastic name Isaiah al-Makari, had confessed during questioning to the murder.
Cause_General	Egyptian media reported this week that Saad, at his first hearing, had denied killing Epiphanius and said he had confessed under pressure.
Distant_Evaluation	In a statement last month, the prosecution said Saad had long had differences with his superiors, who had on one occasion investigated him for breaking monastery traditions.
Cause_General	The second monk accused of involvement in the murder, Ramon Rasmi Mansour, threw himself from the monastery roof this month.
Cause_General	He has been treated in a Cairo hospital where he has also been questioned, judicial sources told Reuters.
Cause_General	(Corrects month of murder in paragraph 1, says Zenon was confessional priest for one of the charged monks, not two in paragraph 2.)
Main	SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, April 27 (Xinhua) -- A villager killed a leopard to save his family including children Friday in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said.
Cause_General	The clash between the big cat and man took place at Awoora village of Kupwara district, about 110 km northwest of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.
Cause_Specific	"""This morning at around 5:00 a.m. (local time) a leopard which ventured into village Awoora entered house of Ghulam Ahmad Sheikh, who in a bid to save lives of family members attacked the wild animal apprehending it would kill the inmates,"" a wildlife department official quoting family members said."
Main	"""During the clash the big cat was killed as Sheikh suffered critical injuries."""
Main_Consequence	Sheikh according to forest officials was referred to Srinagar for specialized treatment.
Cause_General	Following the incident police and wildlife department officials were intimated, who reached the spot to take away carcass of the leopard.
Cause_General	According to wildlife officials, a case has been registered into the incident and investigation would soon be carried out to ascertain the actual details.
Cause_General	There are strict laws in force in India against the killing of wild animals.
Distant_Evaluation	Wildlife officials said leopards stray into residential areas usually in search of food.
Distant_Evaluation	However, the human presence makes them insecure, following which they resort to attacking people.
Distant_Evaluation	At times these creatures are attacked by scared villagers in retaliation which also proves fatal for them.
Distant_Evaluation	Wildlife experts said mass urbanization, denudation of forests, encroachment of forestland, vanishing of buffer zones in the forests and extraction of medicinal plants are some of the reasons responsible for increasing conflicts between humans and animals.
Distant_Evaluation	There is not much left in Baghdad that all its residents, Sunnis and Shiites, laborers and professors, consider their own.
Cause_General	But the Sarafiya bridge, flung across the Tigris, tied the city together, literally and metaphorically.
Main	When the bridge was destroyed early Thursday morning by a truck bomb that collapsed a large section into the river, Baghdad mourned.
Main_Consequence	People who had crossed the bridge every day to go to their jobs on the opposite side gathered on the riverbanks and stood weeping as if they had lost someone they loved.
Distant_Evaluation	More people have died in many other bombings, but the destruction of the bridge struck at the city's soul, at its lingering romance with an all but vanished image of Baghdad as a Paris of the Middle East.
Distant_Historical	The steel bridge, which spans a stretch of river about 500 yards wide, was built by a British company at a time when foreigners from all over the world came to the city to study and work.
Distant_Historical	Construction started in 1946, and it was completed in 1951, while the British-installed monarchy was in place.
Cause_General	Built to accommodate train tracks as well as a roadway for cars, the bridge linked Baghdad's two main rail stations and was one of the city's main transit points across the Tigris.
Main_Consequence	Most of the city is divided now, with the west bank of the Tigris predominantly Sunni and the east side predominantly Shiite.
Distant_Evaluation	But so far the neighborhoods on either side of the Sarafiya bridge have been spared the worst of the violence, and both are still mixed as so much of the city once was.
Distant_Evaluation	Every Baghdadi seemed to have a memory of the bridge on Thursday.
Distant_Anecdotal	An engineer for the General Committee for Trains and Bridges remembered coming to the city from the country as a child and standing in awe before the marvelous bridge.
Distant_Anecdotal	''I used to walk nearby the bridge along with my cousins dazzled to see the train moving on the track, puffing out the smoke backward,'' he said.
Distant_Anecdotal	An Iraqi reporter described crossing it to go to art school every day.
Distant_Anecdotal	''Sometimes alone or with a girlfriend,'' he said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''Sometimes I used to spend hours looking at the river from above.''
Distant_Anecdotal	Riyadh Yosif, a day laborer who walked across the bridge to look for work in the industrial area on the other side of the river each morning, described feeling utter shock when he rushed out after he heard the bomb.
Distant_Anecdotal	''We went out to see what happened, and the bridge, which I loved so much, I found was destroyed.''
Distant_Anecdotal	He began to cry.
Distant_Anecdotal	''I wish they had killed one of my children rather than destroying the bridge, which I consider part of my heart.
Distant_Anecdotal	''This bridge is so important to us.
Distant_Anecdotal	We cross it every day to look for work.
Distant_Anecdotal	What shall we do now?
Distant_Anecdotal	They have destroyed us as well.''
Main	MOGADISHU, June 5 (Xinhua) -- At least ten al-Shabab fighters were killed and one fighter arrested after fierce fighting between the Somali National Army (SNA) and the militants early Tuesday in Bardhere town, southern part of the Horn of Africa nation.
Cause_General	SNA Commander for the 10th Sector, Osman Sheikh Abdi, told reporters that they lost one soldier and three others were injured during the dawn attack which was foiled in Bardhere town in Gedo region.
Main	"""The Somali National Army killed 10 al-Shabab fighters and captured another one alive after launching an ambush on Tuesday morning."
Cause_General	"The attack was foiled and the army killed ten of them,"" Abdi said."
Cause_General	Independent sources said the insurgents had attempted to overrun the Bardhere military base but failed to succeed in carrying out the terrorist attack.
Cause_General	The fighting took place near the main bridge at the entrance of Bardhere town and the fighting took several hours and ended at around 6 a.m.
Distant_Evaluation	He said many residents were asleep when the fighting took place.
Distant_Evaluation	The Somali militants claimed they inflicted heavy losses on the government forces in the latest fighting in the Bardhere town in the southern region.
Distant_Historical	WHILE Hurricane Wilma was ravaging this plutocrats' playground with sustained winds of 110 miles an hour on Oct. 24, 2005, Mario Nievera, Palm Beach's leading landscape architect, was in Pennsylvania, putting on a brave face as he delivered a lecture about his work to the Philadelphia Garden Club.
Distant_Historical	As Mr. Nievera showed slides of his more exquisite creations -- purple bougainvillea wrapped around coconut palms and allées of guava trees -- the plants themselves were being ripped to shreds by Wilma, which would ultimately cause $12.2 billion worth of property damage to Florida.
Distant_Evaluation	Having struggled for more than a year to revive gardens destroyed in September 2004 by Hurricane Frances -- the most destructive storm to hit the town since 1947 -- Mr. Nievera was daunted at having to start all over again.
Distant_Evaluation	Although he stood to profit mightily, he dreaded the added stress.
Distant_Evaluation	In the wake of Wilma, he said in mid-January, ''there's twice as much work, on top of all our ongoing projects.''
Distant_Evaluation	''And there are only so many hours in the day,'' he added, particularly in Palm Beach, where a job like his requires ceaseless socializing with fretful clients.
Distant_Evaluation	After Frances and then, just three weeks later, Jeanne, ''nobody believed we'd get another hurricane'' Mr. Nievera said.
Distant_Historical	Many of his clients rushed to restore their gardens to manicured perfection in late 2004 and in 2005, only to have them ripped out again by Wilma.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Nievera said most of his clients are growing more cautious about how they spend their garden budgets and asking for plants and trees that are more likely to survive another hurricane.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They appear to be heeding warnings from meteorologists that the area could face more major hurricanes in coming years.
Distant_Evaluation	Before Wilma ''the sky was the limit,'' he said, referring in particular to the sums spent on recreating his tropical but tailored designs after the 2004 hurricanes.
Distant_Historical	A client who approached him for the first time after those storms commissioned a garden with $1 million worth of plants, which was installed just in time for Wilma's arrival.
Cause_General	''My client lost $500,000 worth of plants,'' Mr. Nievera said, adding, ''there's no such thing as hurricane insurance.''
Cause_General	Wilma struck as Mr. Nievera was scurrying to get his clients' gardens ready for Thanksgiving, which some regard as the start of the winter season in Palm Beach.
Cause_General	As a result of the devastation, he is still working to finish several of the projects two months into the season -- a delay that few clients would have tolerated in years past.
Cause_General	The follies of the 2004-05 winter season have proven useful in one way, enabling Mr. Nievera to tailor his advice to clients based on his own observations of which plants can withstand extreme winds.
Cause_General	When he advised Tom Quick, a Palm Beach resident whose fortune derives from Quick & Reilly, the former discount brokerage firm, to buy a pair of 30-foot date palms to replace a couple of coconut palms that had succumbed to Frances, it was for aesthetic reasons: they were large enough to hide a view of the house next door that had been opened up by Frances.
Cause_General	But the date palms, which cost roughly $10,000 apiece and cost $20,000 more to transport and install by crane, proved a practical investment.
Distant_Evaluation	''I can't complain: they survived Wilma,'' said Mr. Quick, surveying his backyard.
Cause_General	A large clusia tree at the back of his house was less fortunate, and is now in dire shape.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''We're planning to replace it,'' Mr. Nievera said.
Distant_Evaluation	''We just can't find the tree.''
Main	Despite an abundance of nurseries in South Florida, plants have been irksomely scarce.
Distant_Evaluation	''There are 10 times the number of people looking for plants,'' Mr. Nievera said.
Distant_Evaluation	''People wanted to replant their annuals, but there were none to be had.
Distant_Evaluation	And when that happens, everyone gets really mad.''
Main	Huge price increases have also caused some ire.
Distant_Anecdotal	''Palm trees used to cost $600,'' said Terry Allen Kramer, a perennially tanned banking heiress who is also a Nievera client.
Distant_Anecdotal	''Now one lousy palm tree is three thousand.
Distant_Anecdotal	And these are just plain old coconut palms.
Distant_Anecdotal	Not royal palms.''
Distant_Anecdotal	Ms. Kramer was startled when she and her husband, Nick Simunek, flew to Palm Beach the day after Wilma.
Distant_Anecdotal	Her palatial estate on South Ocean Boulevard ''looked like the Sahara,'' Ms. Kramer said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''I had four feet of sand on my oceanfront lawn, and there was a swath of trees down in the front.''
Distant_Anecdotal	This after she had spent $50,000 redoing the north and south border gardens, following Frances.
Distant_Anecdotal	The fruit trees have been replaced, but with the rise in prices Ms. Kramer is holding out until spring before deciding whether to replace the 30-foot palms she lost on the ocean side.
Distant_Evaluation	Many people are ''waiting to see if they really want to spend that money,'' Mr. Nievera said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's a real change in mentality.''
Cause_General	Other clients, though, have asked him to stormproof their grounds, to whatever extent possible.
Distant_Anecdotal	Earle Mack, whose appointment as ambassador to Finland had just ended when Wilma struck, and his wife, Carol, had to deploy an army of assistants to clean up their estate, which overlooks the ocean and Lake Worth.
Distant_Anecdotal	''We had 17 workers at the house for three weeks,'' Mrs. Mack said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''There was a couple of feet of sand covering everything.
Distant_Anecdotal	There wasn't a single leaf on one shrub or tree.''
Distant_Anecdotal	The couple asked Mr. Nievera to redesign the front of the property, the worst-hit area.
Cause_General	A defoliated stretch of Australian pine hedge that ran 100 feet along the front wall was replaced by a low-lying row of pittosporum, a hardy broadleaf evergreen shrub.
Cause_General	By the front door Mr. Nievera created a pair of parterres edged with Purple Queen ground cover and Green Island ficus, interlaced with diamond-shaped sections of sand-colored Chattahoochee stone gravel and contrasting black lava rock.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's hard to get any colorful plants to grow on the ocean side of the house,'' Mr. Nievera said, ''so I chose the purple shrubs and gravel to create a sense of color.''
Distant_Evaluation	In the center he placed six mimusop trees, which he described as ''very salt tolerant, hard to find and hurricane resistant.''
Cause_General	The ravages of Frances and Wilma also inspired Mr. Nievera to redesign the garden of his own house, a single-story Bermuda-style ranch at the south end of Palm Beach, which he bought in 2001 for a bargain $495,000.
Cause_General	In November he tore out an allée of storm-ravaged guava trees that used to line his front walkway and replaced them with pygmy dates, which are more resilient.
Cause_General	He also cut down all his coconut trees, which had mostly been killed.
Distant_Evaluation	''I couldn't take it anymore,'' he said.
Cause_General	And he came up with a novel solution for his ficus hedges, which took a serious beating during both hurricanes.
Distant_Evaluation	''Ficus are the least wind-tolerant of plants,'' Mr. Nievera said.
Distant_Evaluation	They tend to lose their leaves and are easily uprooted.
Distant_Evaluation	''The tendency in Palm Beach is to maintain them very high -- 20 or 30 feet.
Distant_Evaluation	But you can't do that, because the wind rips right through them.''
Cause_General	After Frances punched large holes in the ficus, Mr. Nievera decided to trim the top of the hedge into an undulating wave pattern to complement the missing sections, giving it a crazy-quilt style that he refers to as his roller coaster.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, for his clients, he has been busy designing ways to conceal an awkward but increasingly familiar addition to Palm Beach's topography: the large propane-fueled electricity generator.
Cause_General	Both Frances and Wilma felled power lines, leaving some houses and businesses without electricity for more than a week each time.
Distant_Anecdotal	(''Palm Beach is very peculiar,'' Ms. Kramer said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''We pay the highest property taxes, but they don't bury the electric cables.'')
Cause_General	Without air-conditioning, toxic mold flourished in the 90-degree heat and the damp conditions that followed Frances, ruining expensive paint finishes, playing havoc with antique furniture and forcing some collectors to send paintings to the restorer.
Cause_General	The long wait for electricity prompted several moguls to buy generators large enough to power a tropical mansion.
Distant_Evaluation	The generators usually take up at least 100 square feet, Mr. Nievera said, and are often seven feet tall.
Cause_General	They cost an average of $30,000, which does not include the cost of obtaining permits, digging trenches and other aspects of installation.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's a carbuncle in the landscape,'' Mr. Nievera said.
Cause_General	His landscaping responsibilities now include locating the generators in accordance with local planning rules and selecting fast-growing shrubs to further conceal them.
Cause_General	He recently obscured a giant generator behind a wall of white-flowering Confederate jasmine.
Distant_Evaluation	''Beauty definitely comes at a price,'' Mr. Nievera said.
Distant_Evaluation	''But people here can afford it.''
Cause_Specific	Some key Senate Democrats say they could consider supporting a short-term increase in American troop levels in Iraq, a stance that reflects division within the party and could provide an opening for President Bush as he prepares to announce his revised plan for Iraq as early as next week.
Cause_Specific	Mr. Bush is expected to outline a strategy that would include adding to American forces, but would link that increase to a plan for economic development in Iraq.
Cause_General	He has vowed to consult Congressional leaders before delivering his speech to the nation, and he began that process on Wednesday night by inviting House and Senate leaders to a White House reception, though officials said Iraq was not discussed.
Main	Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who will lead the Armed Services Committee, said he would not ''prejudge'' the president's proposal.
Main	While he would oppose an open-ended commitment, Mr. Levin said, he would not rule out supporting a plan to dispatch more troops if the proposal was tied to a broader strategy to begin reducing American involvement and sending troops home.
Main	''The American people are skeptical about getting in deeper,'' he said in an interview.
Main	''But if it's truly conditional upon the Iraqis' actually meeting milestones and if it's part of an overall program of troop reduction that would begin in the next four to six months, it's something that would be worth considering.''
Main	But Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who will become chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has said he is opposed to increasing troop strength regardless of the plan, calling the idea the ''absolute wrong strategy.''
Main	In interviews on Wednesday, several Democratic senators echoed Mr. Biden's view, saying they believed that sending more troops would not resolve the predicament in Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	Democrats have become well-practiced at playing the roles of critic and skeptic, particularly when the subject is the war in Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	But as the party formally assumes control of Congress on Thursday, the divisions between the committee leaders, party leadership and rank-and-file senators illustrate the fresh burden they face of articulating a response to Mr. Bush's revised Iraq strategy.
Distant_Evaluation	Democrats may find it difficult to speak with one voice in response to Mr. Bush's plan.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And at this point, party strategists said, they do not necessarily intend to.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Over the next three weeks, Senate Democrats plan to call at least 13 hearings on Iraq, to be held by committees that include Foreign Relations, Armed Services, Intelligence, Homeland Security and Judiciary.
Cause_General	Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates have agreed to testify, officials said, and invitations were sent this week to a raft of former administration officials, academics and military and Iraqi experts.
Distant_Evaluation	Short of reducing military financing, which even the staunchest Congressional war critics have been reluctant to do, Democrats say they believe that one of the most effective tools they have to influence policy is to hold televised hearings.
Main	''What you are going to find is that this is no longer exclusively a Democratic criticism,'' said Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who is a member of the Armed Services Committee.
Main	''A lot of Republicans are going to be standing up and saying, 'I don't understand what the president's strategy is.'
Distant_Evaluation	A lot of people will be asking serious questions, and that will be healthy.''
Main	Senator Evan Bayh, an Indiana Democrat who also serves on the Armed Services Committee, said a troop increase ''might lead to a temporary abatement to the violence, but will only postpone the ultimate day of reckoning.''
Main	In an interview, Mr. Bayh added, ''This problem is not going to be solved in Washington by the president of the United States; it can only be resolved by Iraqis.''
Main	In a memorandum sent Wednesday to members of the Democratic caucus, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who becomes the majority leader, pledged that ''Democrats will work with Republicans to bring oversight and accountability'' to the war.
Main	Mr. Reid has said that he will consider supporting a short-term increase in troops, but his spokesman, Jim Manley, declared, ''If it's not temporary in nature, it's a nonstarter.''
Main	Representative Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat who will be the House majority leader, stopped short of saying that Democrats would exercise the power of the purse and decrease financing for American troops.
Main	Yet he said the new Congress was ''not going to sit silently by while policies are pursued with which we don't agree.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Still, the Bush administration intends to try to find support from the crop of newly elected members of Congress -- particularly those who were elected from Republican districts -- as the president works to build support for his Iraq strategy before the State of the Union address, now set for Jan. 23.
Cause_General	On the issue of sending more troops to Iraq, the White House is also reaching out to Senate Democrats who are facing re-election in 2008.
Main	''I am not in favor of that unless the president can convince me otherwise,'' Senator Mark Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat who will serve on the Armed Services Committee, said of a possible troop increase.
Main	''I think that the Congress, after 9/11, was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt on a whole range of issues related to Iraq,'' Mr. Pryor said, ''but we've been there four years now and it's time for him to clearly have the burden of proof.''
Error	THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ
Main	A man shot and killed by police officers during a burglary here early Monday was identified by law enforcement authorities as the suspect in a string of five shooting deaths in South Carolina over the last 10 days.
Main	Sheriff Bill Blanton of Cherokee County, S.C., where the killings took place, confirmed Monday evening that the authorities had been seeking the man killed in the burglary, Patrick T. Burris, a felon with a long record who had served seven years in prison and was paroled in April.
Cause_General	Police still are trying to establish a motive for the killings and any connection between the victims and the suspect.
Distant_Evaluation	The investigation, Blanton said, would shift to learning more about Burris, and whom he traveled with and where he had been.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It's not over,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""It's just changing gears."""
Cause_General	The killings started June 27 with the shooting of a 63-year-old peach farmer, found in his home in Gaffney.
Cause_General	Four days later, an 83-year-old woman and her 50-year-old daughter were found bound and shot inside the mother's home.
Cause_General	The next day, a man and his 15-year-old daughter were shot inside their family's store about a mile from downtown Gaffney.
Distant_Evaluation	Evidence collected at the crime scene and characteristics of Burris' vehicle linked him to the killings, authorities said.
Cause_General	They declined to give details.
Distant_Evaluation	The shootings terrified residents along the state line between North and South Carolina, leading many to carry weapons, and prompting business owners to keep their doors locked.
Cause_Specific	On Monday, about 3 a.m., police in North Carolina received a report of a suspicious vehicle backing up to a vacant house.
Cause_Specific	When police arrived, authorities said, Burris opened fire and was killed when the officers fired back.
Cause_General	Burris had been convicted of multiple crimes in at least four states, and his criminal history was 25 pages long.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""At some point, the criminal justice system is going to have to explain why this gentleman was out on the streets,"" said Reggie Lloyd, director of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division."
Main	Government complacency, poor planning and dereliction of duty during Hurricane Katrina contributed to the deaths of dozens of the frail and sick in New Orleans, and to the suffering of many others who were stranded in area hospitals and nursing homes unable to care for them, Senate investigators said Tuesday.
Main	In the second day of Senate hearings on the hurricane response, the focus was on what investigators called perhaps the most outrageous chapter of the storm: the mistreatment of nursing home and hospital patients during the disaster.
Cause_General	''How could such a thing happen?''
Cause_General	Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, asked the officials from the State of Louisiana, the City of New Orleans and the state association of nursing homes who attended the hearings.
Cause_General	''Why were so many left behind?''
Cause_Specific	The witnesses acknowledged a long list of failures that meant there was no coordinated or tested plan in place to evacuate the frail, sick or poor, though studies had warned for more than a decade that an estimated 100,000 New Orleans residents without transportation would need such help in a major hurricane.
Cause_Specific	As a result, patients sat in hospitals and nursing homes for days without electricity, fuel, air-conditioning or sufficient food, the witnesses and senators said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It is natural for all of us to believe that fault lies with someone else,'' said Johnny B. Bradberry, secretary of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development.
Distant_Evaluation	''The real truth is Katrina moved faster than we did.
Distant_Evaluation	All of us on the local, state and the federal levels were overwhelmed, undermined and outmuscled by Mother Nature.''
Cause_Specific	Mr. Bradberry, in an interview with Senate staff members before the hearing, acknowledged that he had done nothing to honor an agreement he signed in April 2005 that his department would be responsible for planning the evacuation of the frail in an emergency.
Cause_Specific	''We had no plans in place to do any of this,'' he said.
Cause_General	Instead, he testified Tuesday, his focus was on improving the plan for the mass evacuation of the general population, creating a system that opened all the major highway lanes moving away from New Orleans.
Cause_General	This ''contraflow'' plan is credited with helping perhaps 1.2 million area residents get out of harm's way.
Cause_General	Dr. Kevin U. Stephens, director of the New Orleans Health Department, testified that starting in late 2004 he had tried to create his own plan with bus companies, riverboat owners and Amtrak to evacuate the city's ''special needs'' population.
Cause_Specific	But the negotiations were not complete when Hurricane Katrina hit, Dr. Stephens said, in part because of liability questions.
Cause_General	Nursing homes, meanwhile, were each supposed to have evacuation plans.
Cause_General	At hospitals, because some patients would inevitably be deemed too ill to move, backup generators were to be in place so care could be provided during and after the storm.
Cause_Specific	But both plans failed, the investigators were told, in a breakdown that had been predicted in regional hurricane emergency drills.
Cause_General	First, only 21 percent of area nursing homes, or nearly 60, evacuated before the storm; one witness said this occurred because in the past, nursing homes were not reimbursed for the cost of the evacuation if the predicted storm did not hit.
Cause_General	And many hospitals ignored years of warnings to put generators and electrical switching equipment in places protected from flooding, the witnesses said.
Distant_Historical	Once the storm had passed and the city had flooded, even though thousands of patients needed to be evacuated, nursing home operators often could not call for help.
Distant_Evaluation	Even when the requests got through, they were not given a high priority, testified Joseph A. Donchess, executive director of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association.
Distant_Evaluation	Extraordinary suffering and even death resulted, Mr. Donchess said.
Distant_Historical	At Bethany Nursing Home in New Orleans, for example, which was surrounded by floodwaters, six or seven patients died while they waited four days for buses to move them, he said.
Cause_General	Louisiana statistics released this week show that nearly 70 percent of the 796 deceased Hurricane Katrina victims identified as of late January were 61 years old or older.
Cause_General	Senator Collins read an e-mail exchange that took place two days before the hurricane hit, in which an official of the federal Department of Health and Human Services asked a Louisiana official if help was needed ''for patient movement/evacuation or anything else.''
Cause_General	The response, an e-mail message from the federal official said, was that ''they do not require anything at this time and they would be in touch if and when they needed assistance.''
Distant_Evaluation	Dr. Jimmy Guidry, the state health officer of Louisiana, said the offer for aid was rejected because he did not believe that the federal government was prepared to help.
Distant_Evaluation	Ms. Collins said this answer was unacceptable.
Cause_General	''I wonder,'' she said, ''if the dire straits that we heard described this morning would have been as bad as they were if this offer had been accepted.''
Main	In an article published on a friendly op-ed page, and from the regal confines of the White House, President Bush greeted the incoming Democratic leadership of Congress on Wednesday with a message of bipartisanship.
Distant_Evaluation	But he also sent another message: I'm still the guy with the big plane, the big office (the oval one) and the presidential seal.
Cause_Specific	With the op-ed, in The Wall Street Journal, and in the Rose Garden appearance, Mr. Bush sought to set the governing agenda one day before Democrats were officially to take control of Congress and alter the balance of power that has favored Mr. Bush's party for nearly his entire presidency.
Cause_General	In doing so, Mr. Bush mixed calls for unity in governing with a series of red flags on his signature issues.
Cause_General	Tax increases?
Distant_Evaluation	Forget it.
Main	''The elections have not reversed the laws of economics,'' Mr. Bush wrote in The Journal.
Main	''It is a fact that economies do best when you reward hard work by allowing people to keep more of what they have earned.''
Cause_General	The war in Iraq?
Main	''We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus to fight and win the war,'' he wrote.
Distant_Evaluation	In other words, we're staying.
Cause_General	That new Democratic majority?
Distant_Evaluation	It isn't really so big.
Main	''The minority party, especially where the margins are close,'' Mr. Bush wrote, ''has a strong say in the form bills take.''
Main	And the president, he added -- lest anyone forget -- has the constitutional authority ''to use his judgment whether they should be signed into law.''
Distant_Evaluation	Several Democrats said Mr. Bush's words on Wednesday had raised questions about what kind of president would show up when they get down to the business of governing side by side.
Distant_Evaluation	Some Democrats may have hoped it would be the George W. Bush who contritely acknowledged a ''thumpin' '' for his party the day after the elections in November.
Distant_Evaluation	But the evidence suggests it is more likely to be the man who all but ignored the disputed circumstances of his election in 2000, governed from then as if he had an expansive mandate and who -- even as he has employed soothing tones in speaking to and about Democrats for the last two months -- has gradually but firmly reasserted himself on both foreign and domestic policy.
Distant_Evaluation	''I think what the op-ed showed was the fundamental division within the White House and probably within the president's head whether to stick to the old issues and just talk bipartisanship versus really doing it,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the new vice chairman of the Democratic caucus in the Senate, in an interview.
Cause_General	The first few weeks of January are traditionally when the White House carefully rolls out new or repackaged policy initiatives before the president's State of the Union address, a period when he can set the agenda.
Cause_General	But for the first time since early 2002, when Democrats controlled the Senate, Mr. Bush has to share power and the national microphone.
Cause_General	He also has to show that he has a domestic agenda at a time when his presidency is largely consumed by Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	Both sides were making some effort on Wednesday to play nice.
Cause_General	White House officials noted that the president had highlighted several areas in which he has shown a willingness to work more closely with Democrats, like on a new minimum wage and a new immigration law.
Cause_General	And the White House arranged for a plane to bring the incoming Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, and Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, back to Washington from Gerald R. Ford's funeral in Grand Rapids, Mich., in time for a reception with Mr. Bush and the other Congressional leaders.
Distant_Evaluation	In a memorandum that Mr. Reid issued Wednesday to fellow Democrats, he wrote, ''I'm encouraged that President Bush said today that he wants to work in bipartisanship.''
Distant_Evaluation	But, he added, ''I hope he means it.''
Distant_Evaluation	And in defining his own approach to bipartisanship, Mr. Reid went on to praise Senator Gordon H. Smith, Republican of Oregon, saying Mr. Smith's commentary last month on the administration's war policy -- in which Mr. Smith said it ''may even be criminal'' -- had ''signaled a sea change over how Congress will address the Iraq war.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Reid promised to work with Republicans to ''bring oversight and accountability to the Bush administration's conduct of the war and ensure a new policy that meets conditions on the ground'' but also ''allows our troops to come home.''
Cause_General	Democrats were moving quickly to hold the administration accountable, in their view, for its mistakes, promising to hold as many as a dozen oversight hearings on the war alone in the next few weeks.
Cause_General	In interviews, White House officials did not hesitate to acknowledge that they were taking advantage of the last day before the Democrats take control to assert some presidential power.
Cause_General	Nor did they dispute Democrats' suspicions that the White House placed Mr. Bush's opinion piece in The Journal to reassure a target audience of nervous fiscal conservatives -- and the financial markets -- that he remained philosophically opposed to any tax increases.
Cause_General	But administration officials disputed Democratic assertions that the president was trying to upstage them before their big day.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's an appropriate time to say where we are on these things and to again reiterate the president's view that we can work together to find common ground,'' said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman.
Distant_Evaluation	''It also doesn't mean that a Democrat-controlled Congress passes whatever they want and we sign it -- that's not bipartisanship.''
Distant_Evaluation	But it was clear that as both sides spoke about bipartisanship, they were defining it on different terms.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Fratto acknowledged as much, saying, ''We'll have to see as we go forward over the next six months, in particular, if everyone has the same understanding of what bipartisanship means.''
Error	THE 110TH CONGRESS: WHITE HOUSE MEMO
Main	A soldier from the 101st Airborne Division is scheduled to plead guilty next Tuesday to a reduced charge for mercy killing in connection with the death of three unarmed Iraqi men shot by American infantrymen last spring, according to lawyers for other defendants in the case.
Main	The terms of the plea arrangement will allow the soldier, Specialist Juston R. Graber, originally charged with capital murder, to be convicted of aggravated assault and to receive a nine-month prison sentence in exchange for his testifying against three other members of his squad, the lawyers said.
Cause_General	The three other soldiers, members of the same company as Specialist Graber in the division's Third Brigade, still face courts-martial on premeditated-murder charges, making them eligible for the death penalty or, barring that, life in prison.
Cause_General	Army prosecutors have accused them of carrying out an impromptu plan, following a raid on a marshy island northwest of Baghdad, to kill the three Iraqis after cutting off their plastic handcuffs and forcing them to run, still blindfolded, from the squalid hut where they had been discovered.
Cause_General	The two soldiers accused of firing on the men as they fled -- Specialist William B. Hunsaker and Pfc.
Cause_General	Corey R. Clagett -- have said they shot in self-defense after the three broke free from the thin ''zip-tie'' handcuffs and attacked them.
Cause_General	A third soldier, Staff Sgt.
Cause_General	Raymond L. Girouard, the squad's ranking member, is accused of devising the plan to kill the men, then punching Private Clagett and cutting Specialist Hunsaker to give the appearance that they had been attacked.
Cause_General	None of these three defendants have entered a formal pea.
Distant_Evaluation	The guilty plea by Specialist Graber, to be entered before an Army judge at Fort Campbell, Ky., and his testimony against the other soldiers will make gaining their acquittal far more difficult than it would have been had all four kept a unified legal front, lawyers for the three others said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It changes the complexion of the entire case and makes the case much stronger against Clagett, Hunsaker and Girouard,'' said Paul Bergrin, a lawyer for Private Clagett who said he had not expected Specialist Graber to get ''such an outstanding deal.''
Distant_Evaluation	''It gives the government's case credibility and corroboration where they didn't have it before,'' Mr. Bergrin added.
Distant_Evaluation	''It requires us to rethink our strategy.''
Cause_General	Specialist Graber's two military lawyers, Capt.
Cause_General	Shaun Lister and Capt.
Cause_General	Will Suddeth, did not reply to e-mailed requests for comment or phone messages left with military officials at Fort Hood, Tex., where both are based.
Distant_Evaluation	Their client's willingness to testify for the prosecution, though, was bitter news to the three other defendants.
Distant_Evaluation	Michael Waddington, a lawyer for Specialist Hunsaker, said Specialist Graber's plea arrangement felt like a betrayal, ''especially when we've been disclosing our strategy'' to his lawyers for months.
Cause_General	Specialist Graber's legal team had joined with Mr. Waddington, Mr. Bergrin and Capt.
Cause_General	Ted Miller, a lawyer for Sergeant Girouard, in a collaborative pact known as a joint defense agreement, which lawyers often create if their clients face similar charges in the same incident.
Distant_Evaluation	Defense lawyers said Specialist Graber's plea was not particularly surprising, given the disparity between the evidence against him and the charges he had faced.
Cause_Specific	According to the evidence, Specialist Graber made a last-second decision to shoot the dying man after a squad medic declared him beyond help and, according to sworn statements from soldiers not charged in the case, after Sergeant Girouard said, ''Put him out of his misery.''
Distant_Evaluation	But Army prosecutors nonetheless charged Specialist Graber, 21, with premeditated murder, creating an enormous incentive, defense lawyers for the three other soldiers said, for him to plead guilty to a lesser charge that more closely fit the crime.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The first court-martial in the case will be Private Clagett's, scheduled to begin Jan. 15 at Fort Campbell, Mr. Bergrin said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Two other soldiers, Sgt.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Leonel Lemus and Pfc.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Bradley Mason, are expected to testify for the prosecution that they heard Sergeant Girouard conceive a plan to free the Iraqi men from their handcuffs and have Private Clagett and Specialist Hunsaker kill them.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But Mr. Bergrin said he would call a powerful witness of his own: Col. Michael Steele, the brigade commander, who, according to several soldiers' sworn testimony, told some soldiers to ''kill all military-age males'' they encountered during the raid, on May 9.
Cause_General	Colonel Steele's lawyer, Lt. Col. Raymond A. Jackson, said on Wednesday that Colonel Steele had never given such an order, a denial putting him at odds with several soldiers under his command.
Distant_Evaluation	The Army has granted Colonel Steele immunity to testify, Mr. Bergrin said, and once on the stand and under oath, ''he's going to have to tell the truth.''
Cause_General	Correction: January 5, 2007, Friday An article yesterday about a guilty plea by Army Specialist Juston R. Graber to a reduced charge of mercy killing in connection with the deaths of three Iraqi men misstated the original charge against him and the maximum punishment three other soldiers could receive if convicted.
Cause_General	Specialist Graber was charged with noncapital murder, not capital murder.
Cause_General	The three other soldiers scheduled for courts-martial face life in prison -- not the death penalty -- if convicted.
Main	TIANJIN, China (Reuters) - Two huge explosions tore through an industrial area where toxic chemicals and gas were stored in the northeast Chinese port city of Tianjin, killing at least 50 people, including at least a dozen fire fighters, officials and state media said on Thursday.
Main_Consequence	At least 700 people were injured, more than 71 seriously, the Tianjin government said on its Weibo microblog, and the official Xinhua news agency said two fires were still burning.
Main_Consequence	Wednesday night’s blasts, so large that they were seen by satellites in space, sent shockwaves through apartment blocks kilometers away in the port city of 15 million people.
Main_Consequence	Internet videos showed fireballs shooting into the sky and the U.S. Geological Survey registered the blasts as seismic events.

Main	NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is facing one of its worst floods crises in years after rainwater displaced thousands of people across the country.
Cause_Specific	The rains have been pounding the East African nation for the last two months.
Cause_General	Up to 32 of the 47 counties have been affected by floods but the worst are among those in arid regions, which normally receive little rainfall.
Cause_General	They include counties in the dry North namely Mandera, and Garissa and at the Coast like Tana River and Kilifi and in Eastern Machakos and Kitui.
Main_Consequence	Up to 300,000 people have been affected by floods, according to the Kenya Red Cross, and they are in dire need of food, water, clothing and shelter.
Main_Consequence	The humanitarian agency has also noted that over 70,000 animals have been washed away, hundreds of acres of crops destroyed and thousands of homes marooned by floods.
Main_Consequence	Tens of schools have further been destroyed by floods, affecting learning in several regions across the country.
Cause_General	A number of schools are hosting flood victims as hundreds of learners fail to report back for the second term which started last week Wednesday.
Main_Consequence	Other infrastructure destroyed include roads and bridges, with the government noting it would require up to 600 million U.S. dollars to repair the network.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Julius Korir, Infrastructure Principal Secretary, said 110 million dollars will be used on repair of rural roads while 400 million dollars will be used on fixing urban roads.
Main_Consequence	Kenya Red Cross puts the number of deaths at least 112 and the society has appealed for 5 million dollars in the short-term to support families affected by floods.
Main_Consequence	In the capital Nairobi, the worst affected are residents in the tens of slum districts across the city, who have been displaced mainly due to poor drainage.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	However, the National Disaster Management Authority and Meteorological Department on Monday warned of floods in several city estates in the coming days due to expected heavy rains.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They include Langata, Syokimau, South B and South C, areas populated by the middle-class.
Distant_Evaluation	The Meteorological Department had predicted near-normal rainfall in most parts of the country between the March-May long rain seasons.
Cause_General	However, the rains have surpassed the intensity predicted by the weatherman, pointing to their unpredictability.
Cause_General	Analysts have blamed the current crisis to the effects of climate change, as the weather alternates from one extreme to another.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""Kenya is battling two extreme weather conditions in a span of four months."
Distant_Anecdotal	Before the heavy rains, the country was gripped by dry weather that saw people and animals in arid areas starve to death.
Distant_Anecdotal	Now the same people who were starving are dying of floods.
Distant_Anecdotal	"It is unexplainable,"" said Henry Wandera, an economics lecturer in Nairobi."
Distant_Anecdotal	He attributed the predicament to the effects of climate change, whose vagaries are raging due to forest destruction, among other man-made causes.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""It is going to mid-May when the rains are supposed to have subsided in intensity but they are getting stronger to the worry of citizens,"" he said."
Cause_General	Besides floods and dry conditions, pests and diseases are other effects of climate change the country is grappling with.
Cause_General	Kenya is currently battling Fall armyworms that have ravaged acres upon acres of the maize crop for the second season threatening the staple.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But the worst it seems it is yet to come for the East African nation as more rains have been predicted.

Cause_Specific	Members of a joint federal and state task force probing the international criminal gang MS-13 had tried in August to hold Facebook in contempt of court for failing to carry out a wiretap order, Reuters reported last month.
Main	Arguments were heard in a sealed proceeding in a U.S. District Court in Fresno, California weeks before 16 suspected gang members were indicted there, but the judge ruled in Facebook’s favor, the sources said.
Cause_General	The details of his reasoning were not available.
Distant_Evaluation	The government’s request had alarmed technology executives and privacy advocates.
Cause_General	Officials in the United States and other Western countries are stepping up attempts to ban or limit strong encryption and expand their wiretapping capabilities.
Cause_Specific	An affidavit by an FBI agent filed publicly in the Fresno criminal proceedings said that at the time of the arrests, law enforcement could not monitor any Messenger calls.
Cause_General	Telecommunications companies are required to give police access to calls under federal law, but many apps that rely solely on internet infrastructure are exempt.
Distant_Evaluation	Facebook contended Messenger was covered by that exemption.
Cause_General	The public court filings showed the government was intercepting all ordinary phone calls and Messenger texts between the accused gang members.
Cause_Specific	The FBI affidavit cited three Messenger calls that investigators were unable to hear.
Cause_General	The participants in those calls are now in jail pending trial.
Cause_General	Neither prosecutors nor Facebook would answer questions about the Fresno U.S. Attorney’s office attempt to hold Facebook in contempt or about the underlying wiretap request, including why the matter was dismissed.
Cause_General	The judge heard oral arguments on the contempt motion on Aug. 14.
Cause_General	Facebook and a Department of Justice spokeswoman declined to comment.
Distant_Evaluation	FBI agent Ryan Yetter, in the affidavit dated Aug. 30, wrote “currently, there is no practical method available by which law enforcement can monitor” calls on Messenger.
Cause_General	The affidavit was filed in support of a criminal complaint against members of MS-13, which is active in the United States and Central America.
Distant_Historical	MS-13 also known as Mara Salvatrucha is an international criminal gang that originated in Los Angeles in the 1980s.
Distant_Historical	The gang’s activities later spread to many parts of the United States, Canada, Mexico, and Central America.
Distant_Evaluation	U.S. President Donald Trump frequently uses the gang to symbolize what he faults as lax U.S. immigration policy.
Cause_General	Most of the 16 gang suspects were arrested by Aug. 30, and the indictment was issued on Sep. 13.
Cause_General	Including charges by California state, more than two dozen people were accused of murder and other crimes.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	More information about the government’s court tussle with Facebook may come to light through lawyers for the 16 defendants.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mark Broughton, an attorney for one of the defendants, Denis Barrera-Palma, said he would soon start receiving the government’s evidence.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If the prosecutors’ application to wiretap Facebook Messenger voice calls is not included, Broughton said he would ask for it.
Distant_Evaluation	“I would be interested in seeing, or trying to get an order unsealing that information to properly represent my client,” Broughton said.
Cause_General	Barrera-Palma faces federal counts of assault with a deadly weapon and drug conspiracy, and California charges of murder conspiracy.
Cause_General	He has pleaded not guilty to the federal counts and has not yet entered a plea in state court.
Distant_Evaluation	The still-private filings in the skirmish with Facebook might explain why federal officials picked Messenger’s voice calls as a target.
Distant_Evaluation	One matter judges weigh in wiretap matters is how much of a burden it would be for the company to help.
Distant_Evaluation	In contrast to Facebook’s WhatsApp messaging app and a separate part of Messenger called secret conversations, Facebook plays a small technical role facilitating Messenger voice calls, making interception possible with some effort.
Distant_Evaluation	Nevertheless, Facebook maintained it could not be ordered to alter its software or hack its user in order to help the FBI.
Distant_Historical	Apple made a similar argument in refusing to break into a terrorist’s iPhone in 2016.
Cause_Specific	MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Hurricane Willa gained dangerous strength early on Monday as it churned toward Mexico’s Pacific coast, an area frequented by tourists, with torrential rain and major flooding in the offing, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
Main	The Miami-based NHC upgraded Willa to a powerful Category 4 storm on the 5-step Saffir-Simpson scale as it unleashed maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 kmh) - just 2 mph shy of being designated a devastating Category 5 hurricane.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Willa was expected to hit Mexico’s west coast on Tuesday afternoon or evening.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The hurricane “continues to rapidly strengthen,” the NHC said in an advisory, adding that Willa would probably trigger a life-threatening surge in Pacific tides.
Cause_General	By early Monday, the storm was located about 175 miles (285 km) southwest of Cabo Corrientes on the coast of Jalisco state.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The NHC estimated that total rainfall would range from 5 to 15 inches (12.5 cm to 38.1 cm) across stretches of Jalisco, Nayarit and Sinaloa states, home to the white sand beach resorts of Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan.
Cause_General	Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Vicente, which formed in the Pacific off southern Mexico on Saturday, began to weaken while hovering along the southern Mexican coast on Sunday and by early Monday was located about 195 miles (310 km) southeast of Acapulco.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph)
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	and the center of the storm would likely remain just offshore or near the southern coast of Mexico through Tuesday morning, according to the NHC.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Vicente is seen weakening to tropical depression status by Monday night, but could still cause significant rainfall.

Main	KUALA LUMPUR, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's producer price index (PPI) for local production decreased 2.9 percent year-on-year in November, according to official statistics on Monday.
Cause_Specific	The Malaysian Statistics Department said in a statement that the decrease in the overall index was mainly due to agriculture, forestry and fishing which plunged 22.7 percent, manufacturing fell 1.8 percent and water supply dropped 0.1 percent.
Cause_General	Conversely, the index of mining and electricity, and gas supply rose 4.5 percent and 1.2 percent respectively.
Cause_General	As comparison, the PPI rose 0.7 percent year-on-year in October.
Cause_General	As compared to the previous month, the PPI shrank 2.8 percent in November, dragged by index of mining, agriculture, forestry and fishing, manufacturing.
Main	Continental Airlines board of directors met Wednesday to discuss a merger with United Airlines, a person familiar with the situation said.
Distant_Evaluation	That meeting likely indicates the two airlines are making progress in their talks, which earlier this week were reportedly bogged down over price issues related to an all-stock transaction.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Another Continental board meeting is likely in the next several days.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Speculation in and around the industry is increasing that the two airlines will, in fact, get a deal done.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And that it could come as soon as this weekend.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It clearly indicates they are in pretty advanced stages,"" said Hunter Keay, an airline analyst with Stifel Nicolaus said of word that Continental's board had met."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""I wouldn't be surprised if we have an announcement relatively soon."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"There's going to be some long nights this weekend without a doubt."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Some details have already emerged, including that Continental's CEO, Chairman and President Jeff Smisek would serve as the CEO of a merged carrier and that United's CEO, Chairman and President Glenn Tilton would be non-executive chairman.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The merged carrier - to be called United - would be based in Chicago.
Cause_General	Neither airline has publicly confirmed the merger talks.
Cause_General	Spokeswoman at both airlines declined comment again Wednesday.
Distant_Historical	Continental and United held merger talks in 2008 but Continental ended them.
Cause_General	Continental and United restarted merger discussions earlier this month after United again courted Tempe, Ariz.-based US Airways.
Cause_General	Last week, the negotiations with US Airways were called off.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If United and Continental marry, the new airline will be the nation's largest carrier, eclipsing Delta Air Lines, which merged with Northwest Airlines in 2008.
Cause_General	Continental's shares closed up 55 cents at $22.17 Wednesday and United's closed up $1.24 to $21.75.
Distant_Anecdotal	An airline industry expert said airline officials want to make a decision about whether to merge as soon as possible.
Distant_Anecdotal	"""Uncertainty is nobody's friend."
Distant_Anecdotal	You want to get this resolved as quickly as you can.
Distant_Anecdotal	"Your whole organization is in limbo ,which is not good for anybody,"" said the industry observer."
Cause_General	Meanwhile, local city and business leaders are continuing to reach out to Continental and United to make the case to locate the merged company's headquarters in Houston.
Cause_General	The Greater Houston Partnership and mayor have reached out - through letters and calls - to both airlines bosses.
Cause_General	And they've received no response yet, they said during an editorial board meeting Wednesday at the Houston Chronicle.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""Our concern is we remain the headquarters for a lot reasons beyond simply what might in effect be a few hundred jobs going one way or another,"" Mayor Annise Parker said."
Distant_Evaluation	"""We believe in the long run it's better for the airport."
Distant_Evaluation	"It's better for the city of Houston, and what we've had is a number of one way conversations."""
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Parker said she hopes the operational headquarters remain in Houston, even if the paper headquarters moves to Chicago.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""That's where the power is,"" she said, adding that if Continental's management team leads the merged airline, it would make sense to keep the headquarters in Houston."

Main	NEW YORK, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks traded sharply higher on Friday after Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell said the central bank will be patient about rate hikes.
Cause_General	The Dow and S&P 500 rose 3.35 percent while the Nasdaq surged 4.16 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	Arrogance has never been attractive in a leader.
Distant_Evaluation	Now, in corporate chief executives anyhow, it may be a career ender.
Main	The surprising defenestration yesterday of Robert L. Nardelli, head of Home Depot and one of the nation's most imperious and highly paid chief executives, was a victory for shareholders hoping to force corporate directors to be more accountable on the increasingly incendiary issue of executive pay.
Distant_Evaluation	Even though the board gave him $20 million that was not a part of his employment contract, perhaps smoothing his way out the door, the departure seemed to be a watershed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	No longer can executives demand -- and directors happily grant -- contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars without at least some shareholders uttering a peep.
Distant_Evaluation	Indeed, Mr. Nardelli's resignation seems to indicate a rising fear among Home Depot's directors that they would be subject to even more investor ire and personal embarrassment during the 2007 proxy season than they encountered in 2006, when Mr. Nardelli ran the annual shareholder meeting like a lord over his fief.
Distant_Evaluation	''The departure of Nardelli is good news for shareholders,'' said Frederick E. Rowe Jr., a money manager in Dallas and president of Investors for Director Accountability.
Distant_Evaluation	''To borrow from Winston Churchill, this is the end of the beginning in the war to make directors accountable to the shareholder owners they represent.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Nardelli's fall from the executive firmament was fairly stunning.
Cause_General	In just six years, he went from being one of the most sought-after chief executives, forged in the management crucible that is General Electric, to a top target of investors outraged by his $245 million in total pay over the last five years.
Cause_Specific	That amount was seen as completely at odds with the dismal performance of Home Depot stock on his watch.
Cause_General	Yesterday, the shares closed at $41.07, almost 6 percent lower than they were the day Mr. Nardelli arrived at Home Depot in December 2000.
Distant_Evaluation	''C.E.O.
Distant_Evaluation	's now will understand that they've got to put their conscience and shareholder wealth well above their personal gain,'' said Jeffrey M. Cunningham, chairman and chief executive of Directorship, an online information service for board members.
Distant_Evaluation	''Boards create termination packages when no one even contemplates there is going to be a termination and they are extraordinarily rich.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	You are going to see all those plans rethought and rationalized for the new environment.''
Distant_Evaluation	Shareholders of Home Depot have been smoldering for several years about the company's executive pay practices.
Distant_Historical	Back when Mr. Nardelli arrived, for example, shareholders raised eyebrows after the company granted him a $10 million loan that it subsequently forgave.
Cause_General	He has earned $20 million to $37 million each year since he joined the company.
Distant_Historical	In 2004, the company quietly changed the measurement it used to calculate long-term incentive pay for executives, upsetting investors when they learned of it later.
Distant_Historical	Previously, the performance measure was based on a peer-group comparison, but the new measure involved only the company's growth in earnings per share.
Distant_Evaluation	It was more easily reached because it was based solely on Home Depot's performance not that of other companies.
Distant_Evaluation	To some shareholders, changing the performance target in the middle of a year seemed an attempt to ensure a payout despite a dismal performance.
Distant_Evaluation	''We had a problem with that change,'' said Bess Joffe, manager for the Americas at Hermes Investment Management, a money management firm owned by the British Telecom Pension Scheme, the largest pension plan in Britain.
Distant_Evaluation	''After all, shareholders don't get to change the terms under which they bought their shares midstream.''
Distant_Historical	But it was not until last year that Home Depot's shareholders began to express serious disenchantment with the company's directors over Mr. Nardelli's pay.
Distant_Historical	Last March, about two months before Home Depot's annual shareholder meeting, the board was named one of the 11 worst executive pay offenders by the Corporate Library, a corporate governance research firm.
Distant_Historical	In the weeks leading up to the meeting, shareholder advisory firms recommended withholding votes from Home Depot directors to voice their dismay over the disconnect between performance and pay at the company.
Distant_Historical	But Mr. Nardelli's biggest error, and the act that may have set his demise in motion, was his shocking decision to run the annual meeting last May alone, insisting that his directors stay away and limiting questions from the shareholders.
Distant_Evaluation	''I've never heard of anything like that happening before, where directors don't show up,'' Ms. Joffe said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's the one time of year that shareholders have a right to be present and stand up and speak their mind and directors have to respond.''
Distant_Evaluation	Stockholders were outraged.
Distant_Historical	At least 30 percent of shareholders voting at the meeting withheld support from 10 of the company's directors.
Distant_Historical	Some 32 percent withheld support from Mr. Nardelli.
Distant_Historical	Almost 36 percent of those voting withheld support from Claudio X. Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive of Kimberly-Clark's Mexico operations and the director who had headed the compensation committee when the company changed its performance goals midstream.
Distant_Historical	Many shareholders also favored a proposal urging the Home Depot board to allow its investors to vote on an advisory basis to approve the company's compensation; 40 percent voted for the measure.
Distant_Historical	Shareholders also supported a measure that would have required the board to accept resignations from directors who failed to receive support from a majority of votes cast.
Distant_Historical	After the meeting, Home Depot said it would require such a vote from shareholders for the election of its directors.
Distant_Historical	Even so, the company continued to tinker last year with its pay practices in a way that may have been intended to generate pay for Mr. Nardelli in periods of poor performance at the company.
Distant_Historical	Last November, a Home Depot spokesman disclosed that the company's huge stock buybacks, which have the effect of increasing earnings when measured per share, would be included in the calculation of long-term incentive targets.
Distant_Historical	In previous years, the effects of the buybacks were excluded from the calculations.
Distant_Historical	John A. Hill, the chairman of Putnam Funds, was one investor whose organization voted against Home Depot management at last year's meeting.
Distant_Evaluation	He said he was optimistic that Mr. Nardelli's resignation signaled a new responsiveness among corporate directors.
Distant_Evaluation	But he is uncertain.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''I think if a lot more shareholders withhold their votes for this board in the upcoming proxy season over their agreement with Nardelli, then it will really start to have an impact,'' Mr. Hill said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''But as long as it is a minority, it won't.''
Distant_Historical	Mr. Hill personally experienced Mr. Nardelli's disdain toward his shareholders.
Distant_Historical	As chairman of Putnam Funds, he wrote a letter after the annual meeting to Mr. Nardelli explaining why he had not earned the funds' support at the election.
Distant_Historical	He did not get a reply until August, when a reporter asked Home Depot why the chief executive had not responded to one of its large shareholders.
Distant_Evaluation	''He had become a lightning rod with the stock down,'' Mr. Hill said.
Distant_Evaluation	''But his not replying to our letter showed an arrogance there that came in on him.''
Distant_Evaluation	It seems that ''my way or the highway'' -- Mr. Nardelli's message to Home Depot's beleaguered shareholders in recent years -- does not play that well anymore.

Main	NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified on Tuesday that Trump had directed him to commit a crime by arranging payments ahead of the 2016 presidential election to silence two women who said they had affairs with Trump.
Cause_General	Cohen’s voice cracked several times as he pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges in federal court in Manhattan, including tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations.
Distant_Evaluation	Facing up to five years in prison, the admissions were a dramatic change from Cohen’s earlier boasts that he was Trump’s “fixer” and would “take a bullet” for the president.
Distant_Evaluation	Most legal experts say a sitting president cannot be indicted for a crime, but the Constitution allows Congress to impeach and remove a president from office for “high crimes and misdemeanors.”
Distant_Evaluation	Cohen’s accusation increases political pressure for Trump ahead of November’s congressional elections where Democrats are trying to regain control of the House of Representatives and Senate.
Main	Cohen told Judge William Pauley III that “in coordination with, and at the direction of, a candidate for federal office” he arranged payments to two women for their silence “for the principal purpose of influencing the election.”
Main	Adult-film star Stormy Daniels was given $130,000 and former Playboy model Karen McDougal was paid $150,000.
Cause_General	Cohen did not name Trump in court, but his lawyer, Lanny Davis, said afterward that he was referring to the president.
Distant_Evaluation	“Today he (Cohen) stood up and testified under oath that Donald Trump directed him to commit a crime by making payments to two women for the principal purpose of influencing an election,” Davis said in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“If those payments were a crime for Michael Cohen, then why wouldn’t they be a crime for Donald Trump?” Davis said.
Cause_General	Trump has denied having affairs with the women.
Distant_Evaluation	His lawyer Rudy Giuliani has said the payments were made to spare Trump and his family embarrassment and were unrelated to the campaign.
Cause_General	Trump did not mention Cohen at a rally in West Virginia hours later.
Distant_Evaluation	Giuliani lashed out at Cohen on Tuesday, calling him a “devious little rat” and saying he had a history of lying.
Distant_Evaluation	“I think the president is absolutely in the clear,” Giuliani told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	“The Cohen thing is over.”
Cause_General	Under U.S. election law, campaign contributions, defined as things of value given to a campaign to influence an election, must be disclosed.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A payment intended to silence allegations of an affair just before an election could constitute a campaign contribution, which is limited to $2,700 per person per election, some experts said.

Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Ross Garber, a lawyer who has represented four Republican governors in impeachment proceedings, said Cohen’s statement “dramatically increases the likelihood that, were Democrats to take control of the House in the midterms, they would begin an impeachment investigation.”
Distant_Evaluation	“The odds of an investigation have definitely gone up,” Garber said.
Cause_General	MUELLER PROBE LED TO COHEN
Cause_General	The guilty pleas came in the same hour that a federal jury in Alexandria, Virginia, convicted former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of eight charges of tax and bank fraud and failing to disclose foreign bank accounts.
Cause_General	The Manafort conviction resulted from U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and possible coordination with the Trump campaign.
Cause_General	The charges against Manafort mostly predate his work on Trump’s campaign.
Cause_Specific	The probe also led to a referral from Mueller about Cohen to federal prosecutors in New York who began their own probe of the longtime Trump lawyer.
Cause_General	Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion and has called the Mueller investigation a “witch hunt.” Russia has denied meddling in the election, although U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow interfered.
Cause_General	Mueller has also brought indictments against 12 Russian intelligence officers in the hacking of Democratic National Committee emails.
Cause_General	Cohen is scheduled for sentencing on Dec. 12 and his bail was set at $500,000.

Distant_Evaluation	Davis told CNN he believed his client had information that would be of interest to the special counsel, but did not give further details.

Main	The Oct. 20 vote, seen by international partners as a dry run for presidential elections next year, has been hampered by chaotic preparations, allegations of fraud and ever-present fears of militant violence.
Distant_Anecdotal	But Najibullah, who like many Afghans goes by one name, said it would be a chance to clean up the institution, a hope shared by foreign donors desperate for signs of progress 17 years since the Taliban were ousted.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Fortunately there are talented, eligible and educated new faces among the candidates that can restore the image of parliament,” Najibullah said.
Distant_Evaluation	The government and Afghanistan’s international partners are counting on optimists like Najibullah to ensure the success of a ballot that is already three years overdue.
Cause_General	After a slow start, almost 9 million voters and 2,500 candidates competing for places in the 249-seat lower house have been registered and campaigning began officially late last month.
Cause_General	Kabul’s concrete blast walls have been plastered with election posters for hundreds of parliamentary hopefuls as well as sitting MPs standing for re-election.
Distant_Evaluation	With Taliban insurgents controlling about one-third of the country, thousands being killed in the fighting and doubts about the success of the U.S. strategy to force the rebels to accept peace talks by stepping up air strikes, the credibility of the Western-backed government is at stake.
Distant_Evaluation	“We want to have timely and transparent elections.
Distant_Evaluation	There is no secret about it,” said European Union envoy Pierre Mayaudon.
Distant_Evaluation	“Both on their own merits - to strengthen institutions - and with a view to the next one, the presidential election.”
Cause_General	Despite some talk of a postponement, President Ashraf Ghani has repeatedly insisted the elections will be held on time and both the Independent Election Commission (IEC) and the government dismiss speculation of any delay.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“One hundred percent, the elections will take place on (Oct. 20),” said IEC spokesman Syed Hafizullah Hashimi.
Distant_Evaluation	Preparations, however, have been anything but smooth.
Main	Election authorities originally planned to have 7,355 polling centres across the country but only 5,100 will be able to open due to security concerns, according to the IEC.
Main	For weeks, media coverage has been dominated by reports of fraudulent voter registration and accusations of interference by powerful regional and local strongmen.
Main	Instead of debating policy, most energy has been devoted to wrangling over issues like a new biometric voter verification system which political parties have insisted be introduced at the last minute.
Main	The last of 22,000 handheld biometric verification devices only arrived in Kabul late last month and will be sent out to the provinces in the coming days but no one is sure the $20 million system can be set up by voting day.
Distant_Evaluation	TWO GENERATIONS
Distant_Evaluation	Samiullah Mahdi, a prominent television journalist running for parliament, admits the process is “not much trusted”.
Distant_Evaluation	But he sees the race as a chance to replace a discredited political class of power brokers and local bosses, many who have grown rich on contracts linked to the war.
Distant_Evaluation	“Sometimes I feel it’s a struggle between two generations,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“They have the money, the power, the guns and the political power but they think mainly about past glories and past grievances.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If we have fair elections, people will be able to vote for a new generation that thinks of the future.”
Distant_Evaluation	Under the constitution, parliament reviews and ratifies laws but has little effective power and has become a byword for the rampant abuse that has put Afghanistan near the bottom of Transparency International’s world corruption index.
Distant_Evaluation	According to a United Nations report from May, “Afghanistan’s legislature is part of the corruption problem and has for the most part avoided trying to be part of the solution.” Thieving parliamentarians are stock joke figures for social media commentators and television comedians.
Distant_Evaluation	“People are fed up, they want change,” Mahdi said.
Distant_Evaluation	“Some think, ‘Why do we need parliament?’ but that’s because we’ve had bad members of parliament.”
Cause_General	Thirty five candidates of the 2,500 have been barred from standing by the IEC because of suspected links to armed groups, or involvement in cases of murder, extortion or rape.
Cause_General	Many more, who face similar accusations, remain on the list.
Error	Slideshow (4 Images)
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Nobody is expecting the election to be free of fraud or violence but if the vote does not take place before Afghanistan’s harsh winter weather sets in, a nationwide ballot will be impossible until next year.
Distant_Evaluation	Persistent rumours in Kabul suggest that if the biometric system cannot be set up in time, a delay may be necessary.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Foreign donors fear that if that happens, the credibility of Afghanistan’s fledgling democratic institutions may be fatally undermined.
Distant_Evaluation	“Even though there will be limitations, it is better than a new postponement of the elections, so they must happen on that particular day,” the EU’s Mayaudon said.
Main	HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. forecasters expect the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season will be near-normal to above-normal in number and intensity of storms, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Climate Prediction Center said on Thursday.
Main	The forecasters estimate between one and four major hurricanes packing winds of 111 miles per hour (178.6 kph) could develop during the 2018 season, which begins June 1.
Main	The NOAA forecast also said about half of the 10 to 16 named storms will be hurricane strength with winds of at least 74 mph (119 kph).
Cause_General	An average Atlantic hurricane season produces 12 named storms of which six become hurricanes, three of them major.
Cause_General	Private forecaster Weatherbell Analytics earlier this month revised downward its forecast for named storms in 2018 from between 11 and 15 to 9 to 13.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A system was brewing in the southern Gulf on Thursday that has a 70 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It is expected to bring heavy rain to the southeast United States early next week and could become the first named storm of the year as Alberto.
Main	Michael D. Brown, the former federal emergency management chief who became a ridiculed symbol of the Bush administration's flawed response to Hurricane Katrina, returned in anger to Capitol Hill on Friday and lashed back at his former superiors.
Main	Mr. Brown said that he told a senior White House official early on of the New Orleans flooding, and that the administration was too focused on terrorism to respond properly to natural disasters.
Main	Testifying before a Senate committee, Mr. Brown said he notified a senior White House official -- who he said was probably Joe Hagin, the deputy White House chief of staff, but might have been Andrew H. Card Jr., the chief of staff -- on the day the hurricane hit to report that it had turned into his ''worst nightmare'' and that New Orleans was flooding.
Cause_General	It was the first public identification of any White House official who was said to have directly received reports of extensive flooding on Monday, Aug. 29, the day Hurricane Katrina hit.
Cause_Specific	In the aftermath of the storm, administration officials said they were caught by surprise when they were told of the levee breach on Tuesday, Aug. 30.
Cause_Specific	Mr. Hagin was the senior staff member with President Bush on the day the hurricane hit, when Mr. Bush was traveling in California.
Cause_General	Mr. Brown's politically charged appearance before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs quickly divided the panel's members by party.
Cause_General	Several Republican senators peppered him with hostile questions and suggested he was trying to deflect the blame from his own failures.
Cause_General	In contrast, Mr. Brown drew a gentle, even warm response from Democrats who said he had unfairly been made a scapegoat by the administration, though last year it was frequently Mr. Brown himself who drew the most fire from Democrats in Washington.
Cause_General	In contrast to low-key statements in the past, Mr. Brown, who resigned under pressure on Sept. 12 as director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was aggressively on the defensive, saying he was ''sick and tired'' of his remarks or e-mail messages being taken out of context or hearing that he lacked the leadership skills for his job.
Main	Mr. Brown said it was ''baloney'' for Department of Homeland Security officials to claim they did not know of the extent of the flooding until Tuesday, because he and other FEMA officials had notified them the day before.
Main	In response to questioning, Mr. Brown also said he believed he told the White House on Monday that a breach had occurred in the 17th Street Canal levee, passing on observations made by one of his staff members on the ground in New Orleans that day.
Main	''Everything that we had planned about, worried about, that FEMA, frankly, had worried about for 10 years was coming true,'' Mr. Brown said he told the White House aide.
Cause_General	Scott McClellan, the White House press secretary, said Friday morning while the hearing was under way that the administration already knew the city was being flooded.
Cause_Specific	Regardless of the call from Mr. Brown, there were conflicting reports about whether a levee had been breached, Mr. McClellan said.
Distant_Evaluation	''The top priority at that time was on saving lives; it was on search and rescue operations,'' Mr. McClellan said.
Main	Mr. Brown said that he could not recall if he personally called the homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, to relay the account of the levee breach.
Main	Even if he had, Mr. Brown said, it would have been a waste of time because FEMA's role within the Homeland Security Department had been subordinated to fighting terror.
Main	As a result of that, he said, he was unable to quickly get the kind of action he needed, unless he called the White House staff.
Main	The Bush administration, as a whole, he said, did not seem to care enough about natural disasters and had relegated natural disasters to a ''stepchild'' of national security.
Main	''It is my belief,'' Mr. Brown told the senators, that if ''we've confirmed that a terrorist has blown up the 17th Street Canal levee, then everybody would have jumped all over that and been trying to do everything they could.''
Main	Republicans, including Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the chairwoman, said Mr. Brown's disdain for the new domestic security structure left the department without crucial information it needed about what was happening in New Orleans.
Main	Senator Norm Coleman, Republican of Minnesota, said Mr. Brown was shifting attention away from his own lack of responsiveness to the disaster.
Main	''You're not prepared to kind of put a mirror in front of your face and recognize your own inadequacies and say, 'You know something, I made some big mistakes.
Main	I wasn't focused.
Main	I didn't get things done,' '' Mr. Coleman said.
Cause_General	The remark provoked Mr. Brown to raise his voice almost to a shout.
Main	''What do you want me to say?''
Main	Mr. Brown said.
Main	''I have admitted to mistakes publicly.
Main	I've admitted to mistakes in hearings.
Main	What more, Senator Coleman, do you want from me?''
Main	Mr. Coleman responded: ''A little more candor would suffice.''
Main	Democrats, including Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey and Daniel K. Akaka of Hawaii, said Mr. Brown was being made a scapegoat to deflect criticism from the White House.
Main	''Keep your chin up and fight back,'' Mr. Lautenberg said.
Distant_Evaluation	Several senators, including Democrats, said they were surprised by Mr. Brown's inability to remember crucial details from the early days of the storm, including which White House aide he spoke with and whether Mr. Bush participated in the telephone call.
Cause_General	Mr. Brown also gave differing answers about whether he actually mentioned the levee breach to the White House.
Cause_General	At first he said he could not recall whether he used those words but then later he said that he was sure Mr. Hagin or Mr. Card knew it and that he would have told one of them about the breach during the conversation.
Cause_General	He said he could not recall whether he told the White House aide that he needed any particular help -- at a time when the city was flooding, thousands were packed into the Superdome without adequate supplies and others were beginning to climb to roofs or attics to avoid drowning.
Cause_General	Two senior Homeland Security Department officials, who testified after Mr. Brown, said that his unwillingness to honor the chain of command and give regular updates to Mr. Chertoff or others in the department severely hampered the department's response.
Cause_General	''We have a president, we have a secretary that are seeing things on television, we're getting reports, what is going on down there?''
Cause_General	said Gen. Matthew E. Broderick, who served as the director of the Homeland Security Department's information center in Washington during the storm, recalling his request to FEMA for more information.

Cause_Specific	Redoine Faid, who has said his life of crime was inspired by blockbusters such as “Scarface” and “Reservoir Dogs,” escaped in July from a high-security prison where he was serving 25 years for a heist in which a police officer was killed.
Cause_Specific	His demise after three months on the run followed phone taps and monitoring of a woman who, prosecutor Francois Molins told a news conference, transported people believed to include Faid to a flat in burqas, a head-to-toe, face-concealing garb commonly worn by women in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.
Main	He was arrested as he slept at an apartment in Creil, an hour’s drive north of Paris and not much further from the jail he escaped from south of the French capital in early July.
Cause_General	About 50 officers, some of them elite troops, took part in a pre-dawn Wednesday raid in which they also arrested a brother of Faid, two other men and a woman, among seven arrested in all, police sources said.
Cause_General	Burqas, wigs and guns were found at the premises, one of the weapons a handgun within arm’s reach of the sleeping Faid and a second one that looked like an Uzi submachine gun, Molins said.
Cause_General	Video footage from the scene of the arrests, obtained by Reuters, showed the inside of a humdrum fourth-floor apartment after a police raid, at around 4.20 a.m. local time (0220 GMT), early on Wednesday.
Distant_Historical	Faid, 46, became a notorious semi-celebrity after penning a tell-all book about his colourful life, describing how he was born into crime in high-rise housing estates of the kind that sprang up around Paris in the 1960s and 1970s.
Distant_Historical	The book came out in 2010, shortly after his release from jail for a previous hold-up conviction.
Distant_Historical	Within months he was arrested again over an attack on a cash-transport truck that lead to the death of a young police officer.
Distant_Historical	Faid’s notoriety made him almost a household name when he subsequently took four prison wardens hostage and dynamited his way out of a jail in northern France in 2013.
Distant_Historical	He spent six weeks on the run before he was tracked down and put back behind bars.
Distant_Historical	Faid had spoken in the past of having spent years on the run in Switzerland and Israel, where he claimed to have disguised himself as an Orthodox Jew and learnt Hebrew.
Cause_General	His latest break-out, in which armed men landed in a hijacked helicopter in a prison courtyard to free him from an adjacent visitor room and then fly him out, prompted a political debate over security in France, where wardens went on strike last year over safety standards.
Main	Seeking more money from Washington for hurricane relief, Gov.
Main	Kathleen Babineaux Blanco entered uncharted legal territory with a threat on Monday to block oil and gas leases worth hundreds of millions to the federal treasury unless the state received its ''fair share'' of the revenues.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's time to play hardball, as I believe that's the only game Washington understands,'' Ms. Blanco said Monday night as she opened the second special legislative session she has called since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
Cause_General	Oil and gas companies pay for the right to extract natural resources from the Gulf of Mexico.
Cause_General	Louisiana collects royalties, as well as severance taxes on resources extracted within three miles of its border.
Cause_General	Those programs add hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the state treasury.
Cause_Specific	Louisiana receives no share of the leasing fees on oil and gas reserves beyond the three miles, which are in federal waters.
Cause_Specific	The federal government negotiates those leases, which give more influential states like Florida and Texas extended state waters, effective every August.
Main	Ms. Blanco, a Democrat, said Monday that she sought to split the leasing fees 50-50.
Main	''If no effort is made to guarantee our fair share of royalties,'' she said, ''I have warned the federal government that we will be forced to block the August sale of offshore oil and gas leases.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It remains to be seen whether the governor has the authority to block the leases.
Cause_General	By statute, the Minerals Management Service, the agency in the Interior Department that oversees offshore leases, has to seek comment from the affected governors.
Cause_General	It is not clear what occurs if a governor refuses to approve a pact.
Distant_Evaluation	''You can say we're in unprecedented territory here,'' said David E. Dismukes, associate director of the Center for Energy Studies at Louisiana State University.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Dismukes said there could be a protracted legal contest if no settlement was reached and the governor felt compelled to carry through on her ultimatum.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A spokesman for the Minerals Management Service, Gary Strasburg, said Congress could earmark a share of the leasing revenue to any state.
Distant_Evaluation	As Mr. Strasburg described the process, seeking a governor's advice seemed little more than intergovernmental courtesy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''It's not an issue of whether or not the governor approves of what we're doing, because if she voices an objection, we'll note that and continue with our negotiations one way or another,'' he said.
Cause_General	The federal government collected more than $1.5 billion in leasing fees last year from oil and gas companies along the Gulf Coast, a significant part from rigs off Louisiana.
Cause_General	The state faces a shortfall of nearly $1 billion in the current fiscal year.
Distant_Evaluation	The fight for a larger share of leasing revenue predates Hurricane Katrina, said Andy Kopplin, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, and is closely linked to the damage that pipelines and oil-service vessels inflict on coastal wetlands.
Distant_Evaluation	The greater the coastal erosion, the greater the storm surge after a hurricane.
Distant_Evaluation	''There's a very clear connection between our role providing one-quarter of the oil and gas produced in this country and our vulnerability to hurricanes,'' Mr. Kopplin said.
Distant_Evaluation	''The governor's point is that we need a greater share of the revenues from offshore oil and gas to help us restore and protect our coastline.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Even if Ms. Blanco never carries through on her threat, her speaking up may help by keeping the recovery question on the radar in Washington, said T. Wayne Parent, a political scientist at L.S.U.
Distant_Evaluation	''The fear here is that the Congress and the president seem to be moving on to other things,'' Professor Parent said.
Distant_Evaluation	''She knows that this will capture people's attention and force people to pay attention to Louisiana.''
Distant_Evaluation	That fear has been particularly acute since last week, he said, when President Bush ''barely mentioned Hurricane Katrina'' in his State of the Union speech.
Cause_General	On Monday, Ms. Blanco also announced how the state plans to allocate the $7.7 billion from Washington for block grants and repairing hazards.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The bulk of that, $4.6 billion, should be spent helping homeowners replace or repair houses damaged in the storm, she said.
Distant_Evaluation	She added that the money was not nearly enough to help compensate people who lost houses to the storms.
Cause_General	''We had 10 times more businesses destroyed,'' Ms. Blanco said Monday.
Cause_General	''We had five times more jobs lost.
Cause_General	And we weathered more than 75 percent of the total property and infrastructure damage caused by the storm.
Cause_General	However, we received only 54 percent of the block grant funding.''
Distant_Evaluation	IN the last three months, as Americans debated military options in Iraq, the Sunni insurgency there seemed to grow more extreme.
Main	A network of some of the fiercest fighters, dominated by Al Qaeda in Iraq, forged formal new alliances with several rebel groups and may have begun to draw others into its orbit, according to Evan F. Kohlmann, a terrorism expert who tracks the insurgency.
Main	On Dec. 29, he published a report detailing the latest developments, which are noted in red on the accompanying graphic.
Main	Until 2006, Mr. Kohlmann said, the Qaeda group was ''essentially losing'' in Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	It was dominated by foreign recruits (its leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was Jordanian), limiting its appeal among Iraqis who resented outsiders.
Distant_Historical	All that changed in February, when Al Qaeda in Iraq blew up the Askariya Mosque in Samarra, one of Shiite Islam's holiest shrines.
Main	''That event opened the door to bloodletting between Sunnis and Shiites,'' Mr. Kohlmann said, which was the intent.
Main	The June killing of Mr. Zarqawi by American forces actually helped the Qaeda group, he said, by removing a leader who was a symbol of foreign influence.
Distant_Historical	The Samarra bombing was followed by months of violent reprisals by Shiites against Sunnis.
Distant_Evaluation	Al Qaeda in Iraq, virulently anti-Shiite, became a refuge for aggrieved and beleaguered Sunnis.
Distant_Evaluation	Now the ascendent Qaeda group is led by Iraqis, mostly from Baghdad.
Cause_General	Last week, the Bush administration retooled its military leadership in Iraq and continued to weigh a troop surge, struggling to cope with last year's spike in sectarian violence.

Cause_General	LIKE A RELIGIOUS CULT
Cause_General	Many members of organized crime groups in Italy, such as Sicily’s Cosa Nostra and Calabria’s Ndrangheta, see themselves as part of a religious, cult-like group, invoking the help of saints for their activities.
Cause_General	Particularly in smaller towns and cities in the south, they take part in Catholic sacraments and in some cases have also found complicity by some churchmen.
Distant_Historical	Puglisi refused to play along.
Distant_Historical	With little support by the Church hierarchy in Sicily, he preached against the Mafia from the pulpit of his church in the rough Brancaccio neighborhood, then controlled by the Graviano family.
Distant_Historical	He helped young people in an area with high unemployment avoid the snare of the Mafia, asked parishioners to help police investigations, refused donations from mobsters and banned them from joining traditional religious street processions.

Main	Florence’s intensity has diminished since it roared ashore along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast on Friday as a hurricane.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But its slow march over the two states, crawling west at only 3 miles per hour (6 km per hour), is expected to leave large parts of the region deluged in the coming days, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said late Saturday.

Main	WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House pushed back forcefully on Wednesday against suggestions that a plea deal struck by President Donald Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen implicated Trump in a crime.
Main	“As the president has said, we’ve stated many times, he did nothing wrong.
Main	There are no charges against him,” press secretary Sarah Sanders said at a White House briefing.
Main	“Just because Michael Cohen made a plea deal doesn’t mean that that implicates the president on anything.”
Cause_Specific	Cohen on Tuesday pleaded guilty to eight criminal charges of tax evasion, bank fraud and campaign finance violations.
Cause_Specific	He told a federal court in New York that Trump had directed him to arrange payments ahead of the 2016 presidential election to silence two women who said they had had affairs with Trump.
Cause_General	In the wake of Cohen’s plea, Senate Democrats on Wednesday demanded that upcoming confirmation hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh be delayed, with some calling Trump a “co-conspirator.”
Cause_General	The president lashed out at his former attorney in a Twitter post and said the campaign finance violations to which Cohen pleaded guilty were not a crime - even though prosecutors and Cohen agreed they were.
Cause_General	Trump made the claim without offering any evidence.
Distant_Evaluation	“If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen,” Trump wrote.
Cause_General	At the same time, Trump used the social media site to praise his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was convicted on Tuesday of multiple counts of fraud, as a “brave man” for not cooperating with federal authorities.
Cause_General	Fox News reporter Ainsley Earhardt, who interviewed Trump, said he had told her that he would consider pardoning Manafort.
Cause_General	She said on the Fox’s “Hannity” program that Trump “said he would consider” a pardon.
Distant_Evaluation	“I think he feels bad for Manafort.
Distant_Evaluation	They were friends,” Earhardt said.
Cause_General	Fox News has been airing excerpts of the interview with Trump, which is scheduled to be shown in its entirety on Thursday morning.
Cause_General	After first denying knowing anything about Cohen’s actions, Trump this year acknowledged he reimbursed Cohen for payments he made in 2016 to Stormy Daniels, an adult-film actress whose real name is Stephanie Clifford.
Cause_General	Daniels has alleged she had a relationship with Trump.
Cause_General	In July, CNN released an audio recording reportedly made by Cohen that features the lawyer and Trump in September 2016 discussing whether to buy the rights to the story of Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who also has alleged an affair with Trump.
Cause_General	The president has insisted he paid Cohen out of personal funds and that the payments were not intended to benefit his campaign but to resolve a personal matter.
Distant_Evaluation	“They weren’t taken out of campaign finance.
Distant_Evaluation	That’s a big thing,” Trump told Fox.
Distant_Evaluation	“They didn’t come out of the campaign; they came from me.”
Distant_Evaluation	TIMING QUESTIONED
Distant_Evaluation	Trump critics have argued that the case made by the president that the payments were personal do not hold up given the timing – only weeks before the 2016 election.
Distant_Evaluation	“If this was a personal matter, why wasn’t she paid off after the affair or in the intervening decade?” said Paul S. Ryan, the head of litigation at Common Cause.
Distant_Evaluation	“The election was what made her story valuable.”
Distant_Evaluation	Cohen attorney Lanny Davis said his client had information that would be of interest to Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether the 2016 Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the election.
Cause_General	Davis set up a website to collect donations for Cohen’s legal expenses.
Distant_Evaluation	Asked at the briefing if Trump was concerned about what Cohen might tell Mueller, Sanders replied: “I don’t think the president is concerned at all.
Distant_Evaluation	He knows that he did nothing wrong and that there was no collusion.”
Cause_General	New York investigators on Wednesday issued a subpoena to Cohen in connection with a criminal investigation of the Trump Foundation, a state official said.
Cause_General	Trump has granted pardons to conservative commentator Dinesh D’Souza and former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio, but Davis said his client would not accept one.
Distant_Evaluation	“Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Cohen is not interested in being dirtied by a pardon from such a man,” Davis told National Public Radio.
Cause_General	Cohen’s plea came as Manafort was found guilty on eight charges in a financial fraud trial in Virginia, stemming from the federal investigation into Russia, the 2016 election and possible coordination with Trump’s campaign.
Distant_Evaluation	The Cohen and Manafort cases ratchet up political pressure on Republicans ahead of November elections in which Democrats hope to take control of Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said at the group’s summer meeting in Chicago that Democrats need to retake power to install “guard rails” against Republican corruption.
Cause_General	PRESSURE FROM DEMOCRATS
Cause_General	Democrats found new grounds in Cohen’s plea to question Trump’s Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh.
Cause_General	Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer insisted that Kavanaugh’s early September confirmation hearing be pushed back.
Cause_General	Other Senate Democrats said they were canceling meetings with Kavanaugh and considered his nomination tainted.
Distant_Evaluation	Schumer said he was concerned that Kavanaugh told him presidents should not be subject to criminal or civil investigations – or even be required to comply with related subpoenas – while in office.
Distant_Evaluation	“A president identified as a co-conspirator of a federal crime, an accusation not made by a political enemy but by the closest of his own confidants, is on the verge of making a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, a court that may someday soon determine the extent of the president’s legal jeopardy,” Schumer said in a Senate speech.

Main	Book publishers braced themselves for a financial blow this week after a bankruptcy filing by Advanced Marketing Services, a book distributor.
Cause_Specific	The company filed for bankruptcy protection last Friday, reporting more than $200 million in debt to dozens of publishing companies.
Cause_General	Its creditors included publishers large and small, among them Random House, which is owed $43.3 million, and Good Books of Intercourse, Pa.., which specializes in books about the Amish and the Mennonites and is owed nearly $1 million.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A publishing executive said that while authors and readers were unlikely to be affected by the bankruptcy filing, many publishers might not recover much of what they were owed.
Distant_Evaluation	''This is a huge disruption in this business,'' said the executive, who declined to be further identified because he was not authorized to speak for his company.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''The publishers are going to end up taking a big loss.''
Cause_General	According to the bankruptcy filing, Advanced Marketing Services has been looking for additional financing or a buyer for the last 18 months, enlisting the investment bank Jeffries & Company in the search.
Distant_Evaluation	Advanced Marketing Services also owns Publishers Group West, a distributor for a consortium of publishers including Grove/Atlantic, which may be hit hardest by the bankruptcy filing.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's a mess,'' said Morgan Entrekin, the publisher of Grove/Atlantic, adding that he had been meeting with lawyers for days and was scrambling, trying to figure out how to deal with the situation.
Cause_General	Advanced Marketing Services was granted $75 million of debtor-in-possession financing by creditors so it could continue to function for the next several months.
Main_Consequence	Simon & Schuster immediately suspended shipments to Advanced Marketing Services, a Simon & Schuster spokesman, Adam Roth-berg, said.
Cause_General	Publishers would not give details on their business relationships with Advanced Marketing Services, but the company accounts for as much as 10 percent of some publishers' sales.
Distant_Evaluation	''We're exploring ways to keep working with them,'' a spokeswoman for HarperCollins, Erin Crum, said.
Cause_General	A spokesman for Random House declined to comment.
Cause_General	The bankruptcy filing came over the New Year's weekend, catching many publishing executives by surprise.
Cause_General	The book industry is largely shut down the week between Christmas and New Year's Day, and some executives were still trickling back to work late this week.
Cause_General	Advanced Marketing Services, founded in 1982, has headquarters in San Diego.
Cause_General	It acts as a middleman between publishers and booksellers, obtaining books directly from the publishers and distributing them to retailers like Sam's Club, Costco and BJ's Wholesale Club.
Cause_General	The company operates three distribution centers, in Indianapolis; Hanover, Md.
Cause_General	; and Woodland, Calif.
Distant_Evaluation	Advanced Marketing Services' financial difficulties were widely known in the industry, after an accounting scandal in 2003 resulted in the ouster of several senior managers.
Cause_General	A lawyer for the company did not return calls seeking comment.
Cause_General	The distributor has near-exclusive access to the discount retailers known as price clubs, including Costco and Sam's Club.
Distant_Evaluation	The price clubs can produce lucrative returns for the right books, like cookbooks and mass-market reading, and can allow publishers to reach people who do not shop at bookstores.
Distant_Evaluation	Books are a relatively small part of the price clubs' total business, but they have one attribute that retailers love: the suggested retail price is printed directly on the book jacket.
Distant_Evaluation	Because the books are then discounted by at least 20 or 30 percent, this promotes the feeling among buyers that the stores are offering them a bargain.
Main	AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The International Criminal Court on Saturday said it has taken into custody at its detention center in the Netherlands a Malian man accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity.
Cause_Specific	The suspect, identified by the ICC as Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz Ag Mohamed Ag Mahmoud, was indicted for crimes allegedly committed as de-facto chief of Islamic police in Timbuktu in 2012 and 2013 including destroying cultural monuments and enforcing policies that led to sexual enslavement of women and girls.
Distant_Evaluation	The detention of Al Hassan is a boost for ICC prosecutors.
Cause_General	The only other suspect arrested in Mali’s conflict, Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi, pleaded guilty to destruction of cultural heritage for his participation in smashing mausoleums.
Cause_General	He was sentenced to nine years in prison in 2017 after apologizing for his actions, and could appear as a witness against Al Hassan.
Distant_Evaluation	Victims’ groups had been critical of the court for the limited scope of al-Mahdi’s indictment, though his case was widely viewed as a landmark because it was the first time a person has been convicted of a war crime solely for destruction of cultural artifacts.
Distant_Evaluation	In Al Hassan’s case, judges said prosecutors had presented enough evidence to issue an arrest warrant for crimes against humanity including “torture, rape and sexual slavery; persecution of the inhabitants of Timbuktu on religious and gender grounds; and other inhumane acts.”
Cause_General	Al Hassan will have an initial court appearance next week at which he will be informed of the allegations outlined in his arrest warrant.
Cause_General	He is not yet required to enter a plea.
Cause_Specific	Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said in a statement she had asked judges to issue an arrest warrant for Al Hassan on March 20, and the warrant was issued under seal on March 27.
Cause_General	Malian and Dutch authorities cooperated in the handover.
Distant_Evaluation	Bensouda, who has been criticized for obtaining few convictions during her tenure, said her selection of Al Hassan for prosecution showed her commitment “to bring forward cases only guided and built on a strong evidentiary foundation.”
Distant_Evaluation	She said it also signaled her intent “to address the untold suffering inflicted upon the Malian population and what they hold dear as a people.”
Main	The president of the New Jersey State Senate on Thursday proposed a ban on all gifts to lawmakers as part of a sweeping package of bills intended to stiffen penalties for ethics violations.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Senate president, Richard J. Codey, said he also planned to introduce measures that would ban political contributions by public entities, step up ethics training for lawmakers and their aides and provide full disclosure for expenditures that are added to the state's budget at the last minute.
Main_Consequence	Mr. Codey said the measures, which he hoped would pass by the end of the legislative session on July 1, would bolster public confidence in elected officials in a state that has seen more than 200 federal corruption convictions in the past five years.
Distant_Evaluation	''There are certain things we can do,'' he said in a telephone interview.
Distant_Evaluation	''We've got to make sure that we're up to speed on these progressive measures.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Codey said he did not expect resistance to the measures, largely because each of the 120 seats in the State Legislature is up for election in November and lawmakers will be reluctant to appear soft on public corruption in a state weary of scandal.
Distant_Evaluation	Of the seven bills proposed by Mr. Codey on Thursday, the two most significant concern the acceptance of gifts by lawmakers and increased transparency in the state's budget process.
Cause_General	Currently, legislators and their staff members are allowed to accept gifts valued up to $250.
Cause_General	Mr. Codey is seeking a complete prohibition on gifts.
Main_Consequence	Mr. Codey said his proposal for advance notification about 11th-hour budget additions would require lawmakers to submit a written request for changes to the governor's proposed budget 10 to 14 days before the Legislature considers the budget bill.
Distant_Historical	Several lawmakers called for such a measure last year when more than a quarter billion dollars in expenditures for pet projects were added to the $31 billion budget only hours before it was voted on.
Distant_Historical	Before approving the budget, which ended a seven-day shutdown of state government, Gov.
Distant_Historical	Jon S. Corzine cut more than $51 million of those last-minute additions.
Distant_Evaluation	''Senate President Codey should certainly be commended,'' Mr. Corzine's spokesman, Anthony Coley, said on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	''He has a partner in Governor Corzine on this.''
Distant_Evaluation	Assembly Speaker Joseph J. Roberts Jr. also pledged his support and said he hoped the measures would ''help dispel some of the public's skepticism and cynicism about government.''

Distant_Evaluation	On one hand, it’s a powerful technology to solve cases, but it also raises questions for consumers,” said lead author Benjamin Berkman, who heads the section on the ethics of genetics and new technologies at the National Institutes of Health’s Department of Bioethics in Bethesda, Maryland.
Distant_Evaluation	“The idea that they upload their data for genealogy purposes and it’s used in such a different way really surprises some people,” he told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.
Distant_Evaluation	“The terms of service agreements don’t explain this clearly, and even if they did, people wouldn’t read it or find it in the dense legalese.”
Cause_Specific	Berkman and his co-authors were moved to write about the issue after the April arrest of a 72-year-old man suspected of being the Golden State Killer, a serial rapist and murderer who committed at least 12 murders, more than 50 rapes and more than 100 burglaries in California from 1974 to 1986.
Cause_General	Police detectives had compared DNA from several crime scenes against online DNA-genealogy data to track down this suspect.
Main	Although investigators have long used DNA for forensic purposes, they have typically compared samples to databases created specifically for criminal justice purposes, the authors note.
Distant_Evaluation	And in the realm of scientific and medical research, people who provide samples have clear expectations for “informed consent.” They want researchers to ask permission, but are generally comfortable with giving it for wide-ranging research uses of the material.
Distant_Evaluation	Ethicists disagree over how specific consumers’ consent should be for their genealogy DNA information.
Distant_Evaluation	“Genealogy is typically done for entertainment purposes,” Berkman said.
Distant_Evaluation	“People may not realize uploading their DNA could be responsible for a cousin’s arrest as well.”
Distant_Evaluation	This use of DNA information has consequences beyond the person who uploaded it.
Main	It can result in arrests of guilty relatives for crimes they committed but also potentially false-positives mistakenly identifying innocent people, the study authors note.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	When investigators conduct forensics research with genealogy DNA, they may also interview suspects and contact relatives to obtain more information.
Distant_Evaluation	Since law enforcement agencies haven’t been clear about how these investigations are conducted, it’s tough to debate whether these communications are harmful or an ethical quandary, said Stephanie Malia Fullerton of the University of Washington School of Medicine’s Department of Bioethics and Humanities, who wasn’t involved in the essay.
Distant_Evaluation	“We don’t actually know how many people who have placed their data in these online databases are subject to forensic uses,” she said in a telephone interview.
Distant_Evaluation	“We also don’t know how these partial genetic matches are used, and we can speculate about the possible harms, but we don’t know what exactly is involved or who is contacted.”
Main	Berkman and his colleagues note that, under legal theory, people have no reasonable expectation of privacy for “abandoned” materials such as hair or nail clippings or cigarette butts.
Main	Courts have allowed law enforcement officials to test DNA left behind in different settings, and it can be argued that since users voluntarily upload their DNA into online commercial databases, the legal implications may be simpler to understand than the ethical ones.
Main	In the future, a commitment to transparency is important, they write.
Main	Researchers should begin to study how many law enforcement agencies use forensic DNA searching and how they do it.
Main	These departments should also adopt formalized standards and mechanisms for accountability.
Main	Lawmakers should also consider placing some restrictions on using DNA evidence so it’s an investigative tool rather than a primary source of evidence, they write.
Distant_Evaluation	“Think carefully before uploading your genealogy data,” Berkman added.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’re not saying it’s unduly risky or a bad idea, but be comfortable with the idea that police may use your information to solve crimes before you sign up for these services.”

Main	LONDON, July 9 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Theresa May on Monday night vowed to fight any challenge to her leadership after a day of high drama at Westminster.
Main	First her chief Brexit minister David Davis resigned from her cabinet, followed hours later by the resignation of one of her top ministers, the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Main_Consequence	It prompted May to carry out a mini-reshuffle of her top team in the cabinet.
Cause_Specific	RESIGNATIONS OVER SOFT BREXIT
Cause_Specific	The two resigned over May's proposals for a soft Brexit, which Davis said did not deliver what people voted for in the 2016 national referendum when the majority of people in Britain opted to leave the European Union (EU).
Distant_Evaluation	"Johnson, in his resignation letter to 10 Downing Street, told May that Brexit should be about opportunity and hope, adding ""that dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt""."
Distant_Evaluation	"Reminding May what he said at her awayday meeting last week, Johnson said: ""I said then, the government now has a song to sing."
Distant_Evaluation	The trouble is that I have practiced the words over the weekend and find that they stick in the throat.
Distant_Evaluation	We must have collective responsibility.
Distant_Evaluation	"Since I cannot in all conscience champion these proposals, I have sadly concluded that I must go."""
Distant_Evaluation	Addressing MPs in a rowdy House of Commons chamber, May disputed what Johnson had said and insisted that her proposals were in keeping with what the British electorate had voted for, saying she rejected the views of the deal by both resigning ministers.
Distant_Evaluation	May said Brexit negotiations with the EU have settled virtually all of the withdrawal agreement, but the two models on offer from Brussels were not acceptable.
Distant_Evaluation	"She told MPs: ""A responsible government must prepare for a range of potential outcomes, including the possibility of no deal, and given the short period remaining before the conclusion of negotiations, the Cabinet agreed on Friday that these preparations should be stepped up."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""It is the Brexit that will deliver on the democratic decision of the British people, and it is the right Brexit deal for Britain,"" she said."
Distant_Evaluation	MIXED REACTIONS
Distant_Evaluation	Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, told May that if her government could not get its act together it should make way for those who can.
Distant_Evaluation	"Corbyn told MPs: ""It is two years since the referendum and 16 months since article 50 was triggered, and it was only this weekend that the members of the cabinet managed to agree a negotiating position among themselves -- and that illusion lasted 48 hours."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""We have a crisis in the government: two Secretaries of State have resigned, and we are still no clearer about what our future relationship with our nearest neighbors and biggest trading partners will look like,"" Corbyn said."
Distant_Evaluation	"Saying the Chequers compromise took two years to reach and just two days to unravel, Corbyn added: ""How can anyone have faith in the Prime Minister getting a good deal with 27 European Union Governments when she cannot even broker a deal within her own Cabinet?"""
Distant_Evaluation	Gina Miller, who took the British Government to court in her battle to secure a parliamentary vote on a Brexit deal, described the day's events as extraordinary.
Distant_Evaluation	"She said: ""It's open warfare within a political party that is not putting the country first or second or third."
Distant_Evaluation	"What all of us should be calling for: stop fighting and blackmailing each other; put together a plan, with details not just dogma, then put it to the EU -- get the best deal you can; then put it to the people to validate."""
Distant_Evaluation	Miller said the question should then be to leave or not to leave the EU, adding.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This is hugely damaging to our national interest and global reputation."""
Distant_Evaluation	"David Blake, professor of finance at the Cass Business School in London said: ""When two cabinet ministers resign on the same day, we should sit up and ask whether a sense of reality is beginning to return to the 'Alice in Wonderland' world that Brexit has become."""
Distant_Evaluation	"Blake added: ""There are only two coherent cases: being fully in the EU or fully leaving."
Distant_Evaluation	"There is no coherent half-way house."""
Cause_General	Later this week the British government will publish full details of the Brexit deal it wants with Brussels.
Distant_Evaluation	It will then become clear how EU negotiators react to her plans.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE
Cause_General	Downing Street insisted that May would fight to keep her job if Conservative MPs triggered a no-confidence vote in her.
Cause_General	Conservative rules mean that 15 percent of the party's MPs would have to back a call for a confidence vote, meaning 48 politicians would have to write to Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 committee, to trigger the process.
Cause_General	Political commentators were posing the question Monday night whether two of her biggest ministers quitting would badly wound May's government, and whether the changes so close to negotiations with Brussels reaching a critical stage, could wreck Brexit altogether.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Professor Jon Tonge from the University of Liverpool told Xinhua that the resignations of Davis and Johnson could actually strengthen May's weak hand towards a slightly softer Brexit.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Tonge, an expert in British and Irish politics, said a snap general election was possible, but he thought it unlikely following the result of the election May called in 2017 which led to her losing her narrow majority in the House of Commons.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He added that a confidence vote was very likely, predicting that May would probably win such a challenge among her Conservative MPs.

Main	LONDON, Sept. 15 (Xinhua) -- Former British prime minister Tony Blair said Saturday the upcoming conferences by the big-two political parties will be a watershed moment in British politics.
Main	The big annual gatherings will expose in sharp relief the changing state of Conservatives and Labour, Britain's current ruling and official opposition parties, said Blair.
Main	"As Labour delegates prepare to head to Liverpool next weekend for their conference, followed a week later by the Conservative conference in Birmingham, Blair said: ""They will provide evidence of the driving spirit inhabiting each main party, of the direction of the soul."""
Main	Writing in the Times, Blair, who swept to power in 1997 after one of the biggest landslide victories in British history, said he was not advocating a new party, organising one, or wanting to vote for one.
Main	"""In the British system such an endeavour may be impossible."
Main	"But the serious figures in both main parties need to demand of their leadership: enough, change course, you do not have indefinite licence to go further towards the extremes or unlimited time to return to reason.,"" he wrote."
Main	"""The pull of the tribe is strong, and I sympathise deeply with the struggle many in both parties feel between a desire for party unity and a knowledge of what is right for the country."
Main	"But we do know what is right -- and it is not the present path of British politics.,"" he added."
Main	The Conservatives, said Blair, are at risk of morphing into a narrow nationalist party, modelled on the Trump example, whose leader are either incapable of stopping the metamorphosis or are playing along with it.
Main	"""This is the party that took us into the European Union, fought the 1979, 1983 and 1987 elections as pro-Europeans, was critical to founding the single market and championed enlargement of the Union to eastern Europe to consolidate the western alliance,"" he said, adding: ""Now it demonises the rules of the single market as destructive of our national sovereignty and insists we leave to avoid the payments we make, along with all the other wealthier European nations, to the enlargement countries to help their development."""
Main	"Blair said contrary to myth, the EU will compromise, but he added that Europe will never agree to access to its single market without adhering to its rules, adding: ""Never."
Main	"Because that would destroy the basis of the market."""
Main	"""A ""blind Brexit"", where we only have a vague idea of the future relationship before we leave, should be unacceptable to Europe and should be unthinkable for Britain,"" he added."
Main	"Criticising prime minister Theresa May' so-called Chequers Brexit blueprint, Blair said ""It has no public support."
Main	"It neither properly protects British business nor does it honor what the Brexiteers regard as the mandate of June 2016."""
Main	Pro-European Union Blair suggested putting May's Chequers plan to the British parliament and allowing a new public vote if politicians reject it.
Cause_General	CARACAS (Reuters) - Two men on motor-bikes approached a broken-down vehicle in Caracas one day earlier this month in what could have been a nightmare scenario in one of the world’s most dangerous cities where roadside robberies and murders are an everyday occurrence.
Error	An employee of Pana, a mobile application which dispatches security crews to stranded drivers who request help, assists Vanessa Mikuski to get off a towing truck in Caracas, Venezuela June 15, 2018.

Error	REUTERS/Adriana Loureiro
Cause_General	The men took up positions either side of the green four-wheel-drive vehicle, with a 33-year-old female schoolteacher behind the wheel, and guarded it until a tow truck arrived two hours later to cart it off to a garage.
Main	The two guards are employees of a new mobile application called “Pana” - “Buddy” in Venezuelan slang - which dispatches security crews to stranded drivers who request help.
Distant_Evaluation	It’s a reflection of how Venezuelans are turning to technology to overcome the dangers and nuisances of living in the crisis-hit country.
Distant_Evaluation	Mobile payment apps, for example, attract customers who do not have enough paper money, which is in short supply due to hyperinflation.
Cause_General	Domingo Coronil who started Pana with his brother Juan Cristobal last September said they have carried out more than 5,000 successful driver rescues on the streets of the capital.
Distant_Evaluation	“People’s reactions have been amazing.
Distant_Evaluation	Some start crying, while others take selfies,” the 46-year-old security consultant said in an interview.
Cause_Specific	Violence in Venezuela has shot up during the oil-wealthy country’s spiral into a five-year economic crisis and political meltdown.
Cause_General	Many Caracas residents refuse to go out at night due to security fears, and wealthier Venezuelans often travel in bullet-proof cars with bodyguards.
Cause_General	There were almost 27,000 violent deaths in the country last year, with Venezuela having the second highest murder rate in the world after El Salvador, according to the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, a local crime monitoring group.
Distant_Historical	National homicide rates rose each year from 67 murders per 100,000 people in 2011 to 92 in 2016, before dipping to 89 last year, according to the group.
Distant_Historical	The homicide rate in Caracas alone was 104 per 100,000 people in 2017, the group said.
Distant_Historical	New York, in contrast, had a homicide rate of 3 per 100,000 last year and most European cities had less than 1.
Cause_General	A recent Gallup study placed Venezuela at the bottom of its 2018 Law and Order index, with 42 percent of surveyed Venezuelans reporting they had been robbed the previous year and one-quarter saying they had been assaulted.
Distant_Evaluation	“The fear people have isn’t you’ll be robbed in your car, but that you’ll be killed or kidnapped,” said Roberto Briceno Leon, the observatory’s director.
Distant_Evaluation	Venezuelan authorities say nongovernmental groups inflate crime figures to create paranoia and tarnish President Nicolas Maduro’s socialist government.
Distant_Historical	But even the most recent official national murder rate - 58 per 100,000 inhabitants for 2015 - was still among the world’s highest.
Cause_General	About 700 people have joined Pana because of the high crime rate, Coronil said, each paying an annual fee of 4,800,000 bolivars, or about $2 to $4 on the black market, to request help as many times as they want at any hour day or night.
Cause_General	The company receives a customer’s geo-locations at its headquarters and dispatches two of its 28 security guards to the breakdown.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Coronil hopes to expand coverage to roads outside Caracas and offer corporate plans.

Cause_General	Vanessa Mikuski, the schoolteacher in the van, tapped the button in Pana’s smartphone app when her car broke down without warning that June morning in the east of Caracas.
Distant_Historical	A friend had recommended she download it last year.
Cause_General	The two Pana security guards, who were not armed and wear jackets with the app’s logo, kept pedestrians and drivers away while Mikuski waited and arranged for her children to be picked up from school.
Distant_Evaluation	“You feel much more secure ... And at that price, it’s great,” she said.
Main	ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish authorities believe that prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who disappeared four days ago after entering Saudi Arabia’s consulate in Istanbul, was killed inside the consulate, two Turkish sources said on Saturday.
Error	FILE PHOTO: Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi speaks at an event hosted by Middle East Monitor in London Britain, September 29, 2018.

Main	“The initial assessment of the Turkish police is that Mr Khashoggi has been killed at the consulate of Saudi Arabia in Istanbul.
Main	We believe that the murder was premeditated and the body was subsequently moved out of the consulate,” one of the two Turkish officials told Reuters.
Cause_General	The Turkish sources did not say how they believed the killing was carried out.
Cause_General	A Saudi source at the consulate denied that Khashoggi had been killed at the mission and said in a statement that the accusations were baseless.
Cause_General	The Saudi source said that a security team including Saudi investigators had arrived in Istanbul on Saturday to take part in the investigation into Khashoggi’s disappearance.
Cause_General	Saudi Arabia’s consul-general told Reuters earlier on Saturday that his country was helping search for Khashoggi, and dismissed talk of his possible abduction.
Cause_Specific	Khashoggi, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Washington for the past year fearing retribution for his criticism of Saudi policies, entered the consulate on Tuesday to secure documents for his forthcoming marriage, according to his fiancee, who waited outside.
Cause_Specific	He has not been heard of since.
Distant_Evaluation	Since then, Turkish and Saudi officials have offered conflicting accounts of his disappearance, with Ankara saying there was no evidence that he had left the diplomatic mission and Riyadh saying he exited the premises the same day.
Cause_General	The United States is seeking more information, a State Department official said.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are not in a position to confirm these reports, but we are following them closely,” the official said.
Cause_General	A Turkish security source told Reuters that a group of 15 Saudi nationals, including some officials, had arrived in Istanbul in two planes and entered the consulate on the same day Khashoggi was there, and later left the country.
Cause_General	The Turkish source said Turkish officials were trying to identify them.
Cause_General	Turkey’s Anadolu news agency also reported that the group of Saudis were briefly at the consulate.
Error	Related Coverage Saudi source denies journalist Khashoggi was killed at consulate in Istanbul
Distant_Evaluation	DEEPENING DIVISIONS
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Khashoggi’s disappearance is likely to further deepen divisions between Turkey and Saudi Arabia.
Distant_Evaluation	Relations were already strained after Turkey sent troops to the Gulf state of Qatar last year in a show of support after its Gulf neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, imposed an embargo on Doha.
Cause_General	Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said this week that the kingdom would allow Turkey to search the consulate for Khashoggi.
Distant_Evaluation	But he also criticized Turkey’s crackdown following a 2016 failed coup against Erdogan.
Distant_Evaluation	On Saturday, Yasin Aktay, Erdogan’s AK Party adviser and a friend of Khashoggi, told Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera: “We demand a convincing clarification from Saudi Arabia, and what the crown prince offered is not convincing.”
Distant_Evaluation	He also said what happened to Khashoggi was a crime and those responsible for his disappearance must be tried, Al Jazeera said.
Cause_General	Turkish prosecutors have begun an investigation into the case, officials said on Saturday, and a spokesman for Erdogan’s AK Party said authorities would uncover his whereabouts.
Distant_Evaluation	“The condition of the lost journalist, details on him and who is responsible for this will be uncovered,” Omer Celik said.
Cause_General	Khashoggi is a familiar face on political talk shows on Arab satellite television networks and used to advise Prince Turki al-Faisal, former Saudi intelligence chief and ambassador to the United States and Britain.
Cause_General	Over the past year, he has written columns for newspapers including the Washington Post criticizing Saudi policies towards Qatar and Canada, the war in Yemen and a crackdown on dissent which has seen dozens of people detained.
Distant_Historical	“I have left my home, my family and my job, and I am raising my voice,” Khashoggi wrote in September 2017.
Distant_Historical	“To do otherwise would betray those who languish in prison.
Distant_Historical	I can speak when so many cannot.”
Distant_Historical	Two months later, writing about the detentions of scores of Saudi royals, senior officials and businessmen accused of corruption, he said Mohammed bin Salman dispensed “selective justice” and said there was “complete intolerance for even mild criticism” of the crown prince.
Distant_Evaluation	The Committee to Protect Journalists said it was alarmed by reports Khashoggi may have been killed inside the consulate.
Distant_Evaluation	“The Saudi authorities must immediately give a full and credible accounting of what happened to Khashoggi inside its diplomatic mission,” CPJ said in a statement.
Cause_General	On Saturday Saudi Arabia’s consul-general in Istanbul, Mohammad al-Otaibi, opened up his mission to Reuters to show that Khashoggi was not on the premises, and said talk of his abduction was groundless.
Error	Slideshow (5 Images)
Cause_General	Opening cupboards, filing cabinets and wooden panels covering air conditioning units, Otaibi walked through the six floors of the building including a basement prayer room, offices, visa counters, kitchens and toilets as well as storage and security rooms.
Cause_General	He said the consulate was equipped with cameras but they did not record footage, so no images could be retrieved of Khashoggi entering or leaving the consulate, which is ringed by police barriers and has high security fences topped with barbed wire.

Error	Leaders from non-Communist parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce attend a press conference during the first session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in Beijing, capital of China, March 6, 2018.
Error	(Xinhua/Li Xin)
Distant_Evaluation	BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- To name China's eight non-communist parties is quite challenging for many foreigners, let alone understand the differences between them.
Main	A chance was offered Tuesday as the parties' leaders came to a press conference to introduce how their organizations have effectively participated in China's system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation, and made contributions to the modernization drive of the country.
Cause_General	The press conference was held on the sidelines of the ongoing first session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the top political advisory body, many of whose members are from the parties.
Cause_General	WHO THEY ARE
Cause_General	-- The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang (RCCK) was founded in 1948 in Hong Kong.
Cause_General	-- The China Democratic League (CDL), founded in 1941, mainly consists of intellectuals working in the fields of culture, education, science, and technology.
Cause_General	-- The China National Democratic Construction Association (CNDCA), founded in 1945, mainly consists of patriotic industrialists, business people, and intellectuals.
Cause_General	-- The China Association for Promoting Democracy (CAPD), founded in 1945, mainly consists of intellectuals working in the fields of culture, education, publishing, and science.
Cause_General	-- The Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party (CPWDP), founded in 1930, mainly consists of leading intellectuals in the fields of health care, population resources, and ecological protection.
Cause_General	-- The China Zhi Gong Party, founded in 1925, mainly consists of overseas Chinese who have returned to the mainland, relatives of nationals living abroad as well as those with close connections with overseas Chinese.
Cause_General	-- The Jiusan Society, founded in 1945, mainly consists of senior and mid-level intellectuals engaged in science, technology, culture, education, medical and health work.
Cause_General	-- The Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, founded in 1947, mainly consists of Taiwanese living in the mainland.
Cause_General	HOW IT WORKS
Cause_General	The leaders shared the highlights of their participation in political consultation, deliberation of state affairs, and democratic supervision.
Cause_General	A considerable number of members of the non-communist parties are deputies to the National People's Congress or members of the National Committee of the CPPCC, able to participate in the country's top-level legislative affairs or political consultations.
Cause_General	The non-communist parties have also launched a series of supervisory investigations on issues such as health care, education, regional economic integration, and poverty reduction.
Distant_Evaluation	The investigation reports often go directly to the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee or the State Council and many helped in formulating policies and laws, according to Wan Exiang, chairperson of the RCCK Central Committee.
Distant_Evaluation	NEW TYPE OF PARTY SYSTEM
Cause_General	President Xi Jinping shared his understanding of China's party system while attending a joint panel discussion with political advisors on Sunday.
Distant_Evaluation	"The system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation led by the CPC is ""a new type of party system growing from China's soil,"" said Xi, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission."
Distant_Evaluation	The Chinese system is new, because it unites all political parties and people without party affiliation toward a common goal, effectively preventing the flaws of the absence of oversight in one-party rule, or power rotation and nasty competition among multiple political parties, according to Xi.
Distant_Evaluation	When asked to comment on Xi's words, Hao Mingjin, head of the CNDCA Central Committee, said China's party system has unique creative elements with Chinese characteristics.
Distant_Evaluation	The new system had offered a Chinese approach and Chinese wisdom to the development of party politics around the world, said Hao.
Distant_Evaluation	Ding Zhongli, chairperson of the CDL Central Committee and vice president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), also summarized the differences between China's multiparty cooperation system, and the one-party system or competitive multiparty politics in other countries.
Distant_Evaluation	EVEN before last April's disastrous floods, the Meyers Grove neighborhood along the Neversink River wasn't exactly Malibu, just an unpretentious jumble of modest houses, trailers and bungalows, many of them converted from summer vacation cottages.
Cause_General	But 10 months after the river roared over its banks, cresting at 11 feet over flood stage, it still looks like parts of New Orleans, with some houses repaired and rebuilt, some vacant and condemned, and others reduced to doleful piles of rubble, waiting to be hauled away.
Cause_Specific	Last year's flooding on the Delaware River and some of its tributaries, including the Neversink, may be a fleeting memory downstate, but for residents in Meyers Grove, along Rivers Edge Road down the road in nearby Huguenot and in dozens of other riverside towns and hamlets, it's no more past than Katrina is for residents of the Gulf Coast.
Distant_Evaluation	So, if Mark D. House, the supervisor of the Town of Deerpark in Orange County, whose 9,000 residents include the people of Meyers Grove, sounds a little hyperbolic as he talks about reservoir levels and spillway management, it's not just him.
Distant_Evaluation	This is one subject where the upstate/downstate divide is now more divided than ever.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's like they're holding a gun to my head, it's loaded, they have their finger on the trigger, and they're squeezing the trigger,'' he said, navigating his way around the neighborhood in his PT Cruiser.
Distant_Evaluation	''And they have the gall to say, oh, by the way, if this should go off, it's not our fault and it's not our responsibility.''
Cause_General	The gun, if you want to call it that, is the water in the Neversink Reservoir, now over 100 percent of capacity at a time that it's usually around 80.
Cause_General	When kept at a lower level, the reservoir, which is part of New York City's water supply system, can help prevent or limit flooding, by giving water from swollen rivers a place to collect rather than cascading downstream.
Cause_General	But keeping such reservoirs as full as possible maximizes the city's ability to provide water downstate even in an extended dry spell.
Distant_Evaluation	The city's Department of Environmental Protection has always said that it's in the water delivery business, not the flood control business, and that, in fact, its reservoirs in the Catskill and Delaware systems have limited abilities to release water and manage flooding.
Cause_Specific	But after two severe floods almost back to back, first in September 2004, then in April 2005, that policy now comes across as imperial arrogance to flooded residents and communities.
Main_Consequence	So up and down the rivers, people are hiring lawyers, forming organizations, gearing up for something other than business as it's usually been conducted.
Distant_Evaluation	In a letter to New York's two United States senators and local representatives, State Senator John J. Bonacic, whose district encompasses much of the city's watershed, said last week it was outrageous that a year after the flooding, reservoir levels were still at 100 percent capacity, in advance of expected spring rains and snowmelt.
Main_Consequence	He is calling on officials to lobby against a federal designation the city needs to avoid building a $10 billion filtration system unless the city satisfactorily addresses dam safety and flood control issues.
Distant_Evaluation	''The D.E.P.
Distant_Evaluation	's position is arrogant,'' he wrote.
Distant_Evaluation	''It is the most arrogant position by any agency that I have seen in all my years of holding public office.''
Cause_General	FOR its part, the environmental agency says it has already altered its policies, consistent with its legal obligations, particularly with the Delaware River Basin Commission, where New York State and its neighbors New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Delaware must approve changes in water releases.
Cause_General	The agency says it has already begun a program of releases of water based on anticipated snowmelt and has proposed a more ambitious one that would allow releases that would be equal to the water from a one-inch rainfall over a six-hour period.
Distant_Evaluation	''I think it's a start, and it's a show of good faith,'' said Michael Principe, deputy commissioner of the D.E.P.
Distant_Evaluation	''We can never reduce 100 percent of the risk, but this is a way of mitigating some of the risk, which is the best we can expect.''
Distant_Evaluation	In truth, there's a lot more at issue than the D.E.P.
Distant_Evaluation	's flood control measures on reservoirs and dams built with limited flood control technology.
Distant_Evaluation	Rivers do flood.
Distant_Evaluation	Blame nature.
Distant_Evaluation	People do live in flood-prone areas.
Distant_Evaluation	Meyers Grove is one of them.
Main	Still, it's clear that the recent flooding has, for now at least, changed the balance between the people upstate who live beneath the dams and people downstate who just want to know that water will come out when they open the tap.
Cause_General	Like it or not, the city has a toe in the flood control business, after all.
Cause_General	For now, the reservoirs are full.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The rainy season is around the corner.
Distant_Evaluation	So people watch the weather, they watch the rivers, they wait, and they worry.

Main	MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican troops and police committed two extrajudicial killings while confronting presumed fuel thieves in the central state of Puebla in May 2017, a Mexican human rights group said on Wednesday, adding to allegations of abuse against the military.
Cause_General	A report by the National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) said police and troops manipulated the scene by placing high-caliber firearms beside the two bodies.
Cause_General	Eight other people died and 13 people, including four minors, were detained with excessive force, the report said.
Cause_General	Neither the defense ministry nor the Puebla police force responded to requests for comment.
Cause_General	The state government declined to comment.
Cause_General	The military has assumed some police duties in Mexico for more than a decade, working to combat rising drug violence that contributed to a record 31,000 homicides in 2017.
Cause_General	Their increased responsibilities have coincided with accusations of human rights violations including extrajudicial killings, kidnappings and torture.
Main	“As a result of its investigation, the CNDH has the evidence to show grave violations to human rights and personal freedom,” the group said of the reported deaths in Puebla.
Cause_General	The CNDH urged state oil firm Pemex to cooperate in investigations and not let its property be used to hold detainees.
Cause_General	Pemex did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Distant_Historical	The CNDH previously found that armed forces were involved in the murder of four people in the state of Tamaulipas in 2014, and that soldiers arbitrarily executed two people after an illegal raid in 2016.
Distant_Evaluation	“This case is one more example of how the Mexican military violates human rights,” Amnesty International said in a statement in response to the CNDH report.
Distant_Evaluation	“It’s time for the armed forces to return to their barracks.”
Cause_General	The CNDH called on the Mexican attorney general’s office to investigate, and said national and state officials should provide reparations for the victims.
Distant_Historical	Mexico’s congress passed a controversial security law last year that would lay out the rules under which the armed forces can operate in the battle with organized crime.
Distant_Historical	The law was strongly criticized by opponents who fear it could open the door to more abuses.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has said the law will not be implemented until it is reviewed by the Supreme Court.
Main	(Reuters) - Travelers Corp (TRV.N) is girding for “significant” losses from Hurricane Michael, which caused destruction in Florida and six other U.S. states this month, Chief Financial Officer Daniel Frey said on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	Travelers, one of the largest U.S. property and casualty insurers, is still reviewing the losses but expects them to be “manageable,” Frey said in a call with analysts to discuss third-quarter results.
Distant_Evaluation	They will not preclude the company from restarting a stock buyback program planned for next week, he added.
Cause_General	Shares of the Dow component dipped 0.6 percent to $125.67.
Main	Hurricane Michael occurred in early October, so its losses will affect fourth-quarter results.
Cause_General	During the third quarter, Travelers’ profit more than doubled, driven by lower catastrophe losses and an increase in premiums and investment income.
Cause_General	Net premiums written rose 6 percent to $7.06 billion, helped by improved prices coupled with higher levels of retention.
Cause_General	Higher returns from its fixed income and private equity portfolio business helped boost investment income by 20 percent to $547 million.
Cause_General	Net of reinsurance, Travelers’ catastrophe losses plunged 62.3 percent to $264 million in the quarter, and the insurer incurred higher-than-expected losses in September in the aftermath of Hurricane Florence that hit North Carolina, a state where the company has a large presence.
Cause_General	The company’s combined ratio fell to 96.6 percent from 103.2 percent a year earlier.
Cause_General	A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.
Cause_General	Net income rose to $709 million, or $2.62 per share, in the quarter, from $293 million, or $1.05 per share, a year earlier.
Cause_General	Excluding items, the company earned $2.54 per share while analysts expected $2.26, according to Refinitiv data.
Cause_General	Total revenue rose 5.4 percent to $7.7 billion.
Distant_Historical	The insurer incurred a $436 million charge from catastrophe losses in the same period last year due to mounting claims arising from hurricanes Irma, Maria and Harvey, which hit the United States.
Cause_General	Travelers has closed more than 90 percent of homeowners’ claims stemming from Hurricane Florence, Chief Executive Officer Alan Schnitzer said during the call.
Cause_General	The insurer also raised premiums on homeowner policies that were renewed since last year and expects increases during future quarters, said Michael Klein, who heads its personal insurance business.
Main	President Bush is seeking a new chief lawyer with credentials as a proven combatant as he and his staff prepare for a potential raft of investigations from Democrats in Congress who have promised to challenge the White House's conduct of policy and its assertions of executive power.
Main	Republicans who have consulted with administration officials on personnel said the White House chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, was looking for a seasoned Washington hand to succeed Harriet E. Miers, the White House counsel who announced her resignation on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	Republicans said Friday in interviews that the White House was now, in essence, seeking a politically savvy outsider with ties throughout the capital and in Congress who might be called upon to become something of a public figure in potentially high-profile fights.
Distant_Evaluation	''They need somebody who can sit down face-to-face with an ornery committee chairman and work out a conflict over an oversight request,'' said Bradford A. Berenson, a former associate counsel for Mr. Bush during his first term.
Distant_Evaluation	''The job will require a certain minimum level of stature and a minimum level of political experience.''
Distant_Evaluation	Several Republicans, including some former administration officials, said the new White House counsel would also need the stature to counterbalance David S. Addington, the powerful chief of staff of Vice President Dick Cheney.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Addington has tended to argue against cooperating with Congressional requests for classified information, a position that may require some softening, or at least more diplomacy, in the 110th Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	The White House is, in some respects, seeking a figure who is the mirror opposite of Ms. Miers, who has not shown a high level of comfort being a public figure, especially since withdrawing herself from the Supreme Court nominating process in 2005 under heavy fire from liberals and conservatives.
Distant_Evaluation	Ms. Miers spent most of her career in Texas, and did most of her maneuvering within the White House.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Bush's choice will be in the mold of the former solicitor general, Theodore B. Olson, said Republican allies of Mr. Bush who are familiar with the administration's views.
Cause_General	These people, speaking anonymously to preserve their access to White House officials, said they took Mr. Olson at his word that he was not interested in the position.
Cause_General	These Republicans said other contenders in that mold include Fred F. Fielding, the Reagan-era White House counsel who is now a corporate lawyer in Washington; Charles J. Cooper, a former Justice Department official under President Ronald Reagan, also now practicing law in Washington; Laurence H. Silberman, the retired United States Court of Appeals judge close to Mr. Cheney; and David Aufhauser, the former general counsel for the Treasury Department who is now the global general counsel for UBS, the Swiss bank.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Aufhauser, who has worked with Ms. Miers, also played a crucial legal role for Mr. Bush during the recount of the presidential vote in 2000.
Cause_General	Another name bandied about by some Republicans, but considered a long shot because he lacks Washington legal experience, is J. Thomas Schieffer, the ambassador to Japan who is both a friend and former business partner of President Bush.
Cause_General	Mr. Schieffer has been overseas since 2001, having been ambassador to Australia, and may be interested in a Washington job.
Distant_Evaluation	The people familiar with the White House thinking said Ms. Miers's departure, coming amid a number of changes in top administration jobs, had been among the most painful personally for Mr. Bush, who has grown quite close to her over more than a decade of collaboration.
Cause_Specific	Her resignation capped months of speculation about her future at the White House.
Cause_General	Republicans close to the White House said that, in the spring, Mr. Bolten had considered replacing Ms. Miers but that Mr. Bush had made it clear he would consider no such thing.
Distant_Evaluation	But after the Democrats' election victories in November and the promises by some to challenge Mr. Bush's claims of executive power, Mr. Bolten had new incentive to push for change in the counsel's office, several Republicans said.
Distant_Evaluation	Two administration officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a delicate personnel issue, said that Ms. Miers was ready to leave all the same, and disputed suggestions that she was forced out of the post, which they said she could have kept had she wanted to.
Cause_General	Correction: January 17, 2007, Wednesday An article on Jan. 6 about White House efforts to find a new chief counsel misstated the working status of Laurence H. Silberman of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, who was considered a contender for the job.
Cause_General	On Nov. 1, 2000, he took senior status, which allows a judge to continue to serve while handling fewer cases than a judge in active service; he has not retired.
Cause_General	(President Bush has since named Fred F. Fielding to be the White House counsel.)

Cause_General	UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Saturday demanded the United States take steps to secure Pyongyang's trust before its denuclearization.
Main	"""Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first,"" DPRK Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly."
Main	"""The DPRK government's commitment to denuclearization is solid and firm."
Main	"However, it is only possible if the U.S. secures our sufficient trust toward the U.S."""
Main	The key to consolidating peace and security on the Korean Peninsula is to thoroughly implement the joint statement adopted at the historic summit between the DPRK's top leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in Singapore in June, said Ri.
Main	The joint statement contains all principled issues regarding eventual solutions of the issues on the Korean Peninsula, he said.
Main	"""Once the DPRK-U.S. Joint Statement is implemented, the current trend toward detente will turn into durable peace, and the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will also be achieved."""
Main	The primary task for effectively implementing the joint statement should be bringing down the barrier of mistrust between the two countries, said Ri.
Main	Out of the desire and resolute determination to successfully implement the joint statement, the DPRK government gives particular attention to trust-building and is pouring primary efforts to this, he said.
Main	Even before the summit, DPRK took significant good-will measures such as stopping nuclear and ballistic missile tests and dismantling a nuclear test site, said Ri.
Main	"""However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S. On the contrary, instead of addressing our concern for the absence of peace regime in the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. insists on 'denuclearization-first' and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and even objecting the 'declaration of the end of war'."""
Main	"""The perception that sanctions can bring us on our knees is a pipe dream of the people who are ignorant about us."
Main	"But the problem is that the continued sanctions are deepening our mistrust."""
Main	If the joint statement becomes a victim of the domestic politics of the United States, then the greatest victim of the subsequent unpredictable consequences will be the United States itself as a whole, Ri warned.
Main	At this critical juncture, the Unites States should make a foresighted judgment that faithful fulfillment of its commitment will, in the end, be in the best national interests of the United Sates and should maintain new method for solving the DPRK-U.S. relations, he said.
Cause_General	"Speaking before a meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in New York on Monday, Trump announced that himself and Kim will hold a second summit ""in the not too distant future."""
Cause_General	After a meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly on Wednesday, the State Department announced that Pompeo will travel to the DPRK to discuss the second Trump-Kim summit.
Cause_General	"In his speech at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, Trump thanked Kim ""for his courage and for the steps he has taken."""
Cause_General	"But he added that much work remains to be done and that the sanctions against the DPRK will stay in place ""until denuclearization occurs."""

Cause_Specific	Prosecutors said the 30-year-old had been raped, beaten and suffocated.
Cause_Specific	Marinova’s body was found in a park near the Danube river in Ruse on Saturday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“There is no democracy without a free press ... We expect a swift and thorough investigation to bring those responsible to justice,” the European Commission, the European Union’s executive said in a tweet.
Cause_General	Bulgaria ranked 111 out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index this year, lower than any other EU member.
Cause_General	While there has been no link established to her work so far, the killing has angered and upset many in a country where people are frustrated with rampant corruption and an inefficient and graft-prone judiciary, for which Sofia has been repeatedly rapped by the European Commission.
Cause_General	On her last aired TV show, on Sept. 30, Marinova introduced two journalists who were investigating alleged corruption involving EU funds.
Cause_General	She said the regional current affairs show, “Detector”, would do similar investigations.
Cause_General	Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov said a bank transfer of 14 million euros ($16.06 million) had been frozen as part of a pre-trial investigation into issues raised by the investigative journalists on the show but declined to give further details.
Distant_Anecdotal	“There is no way that I can believe that this killing is random, after it happened just few days after the show that featured such massive misuse of funds.
Distant_Anecdotal	I am glad so many people are here,” said Stoyka Panagonova, a mother of three, at the vigil in Ruse.
Cause_General	The European anti-fraud office OLAF declined to comment on the killing.
Cause_General	But its press office said it was “aware of allegations concerning possible misuse of EU funds in Bulgaria that have been brought to light by journalists in recent weeks”.
Cause_General	Marinova’s appearance on “Detector” was the first time she had anchored the show on Ruse-based TV station TVN - a popular channel in northeastern Bulgaria.
Distant_Evaluation	Previously, she was best known for presenting a regional lifestyle show and was not a household name nationally.
Cause_General	CANDLES LIT
Distant_Evaluation	Interior Minister Mladen Marinov has said that there was no evidence to suggest a link to Marinova’s work as journalist so far - something echoed by police and prosecutors.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are working on all possible motives and we do not exclude any,” Marinov told reporters on Monday in Ruse, Bulgaria’s main Danube river port city.
Cause_General	He said no match had been found so far for DNA collected from the crime scene, which was close to a psychiatric clinic.
Distant_Evaluation	Police and prosecutors said they were working on three possible motives - whether Marinova was a victim of a random attack by a person with a mental disorder, a planned attack or whether the crime was linked to her personal life.
Cause_General	Marinova would be the third journalist murdered in the European Union over the past 12 months.
Distant_Historical	Daphne Caruana Galizia, Malta’s best-known investigative reporter, was killed when a bomb blew up her car in October last year and Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak was shot dead in February.
Cause_General	Hundreds of people flocked to Ruse’s main square to put flowers in front of a picture of Marinova, with some in the crowds urging the authorities not to play down the possibility her work was a reason for the killing.

Main	LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Taylor Swift’s decision to break her silence on politics triggered a storm on Monday, with even U.S. President Donald Trump weighing in on the pop music star’s remarks in support of Democrats.
Distant_Evaluation	Swift, 28, has notably stayed out of the U.S. political fray in contrast to her more vocal peers, like Democratic supporters Katy Perry and Beyonce and Republican backer Kid Rock.
Cause_Specific	But Swift on Sunday told her 112 million Instagram followers that she would vote for two Democrats running in Tennessee in the U.S. congressional midterm elections on Nov. 6.
Cause_Specific	“In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now,” Swift wrote.
Main	Asked about Swift’s comments, Trump on Monday told reporters; “Let’s say that I like Taylor’s music about 25 percent less now, OK?”
Distant_Historical	Before he was elected in 2016, Trump had spoken warmly of Swift.
Distant_Historical	On separate occasions on Twitter in 2012 he called her “fantastic” and “terrific.”
Cause_Specific	The “Speak Now” singer said in her Instagram post she was a supporter of gay rights and women’s rights, and against racism.
Cause_Specific	“I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love,” Swift wrote, saying she would vote for Democrats Phil Bredesen for the U.S. Senate and Jim Cooper for the House of Representatives.
Cause_General	Bredesen, a former Tennessee governor, is facing Republican Representative Marsha Blackburn in what has become an extremely close race for the Senate seat being vacated by Republican Bob Corker.
Distant_Evaluation	Swift said that while she typically tries to support women running for office, Blackburn’s voting record “appalls and terrifies me.”
Cause_General	Swift’s comments got 1.5 million likes on her Instagram page.
Distant_Evaluation	But they enraged many conservatives, especially those in the country music community where Swift got her start as a teenager and went on to win 10 Grammys.
Distant_Evaluation	“What I used to love about Taylor Swift is she stayed away from politics,” Charlie Kirk, founder of the conservative non-profit student organization Turning Point, said on Fox News television on Monday.
Cause_General	Some sought to play down Swift’s influence outside her predominantly young girl fan base.
Distant_Evaluation	“So @taylorswift13 has every right to be political but it won’t impact election unless we allow 13 yr old girls to vote,” tweeted former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, who twice sought the Republican presidential nomination.
Cause_General	Former “Star Trek” actor George Takei was among those welcoming Swift’s declaration ahead of what are expected to be polarizing elections in November.

Error	REUTERS/Carlos Jasso/File Photo
Main	SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing Technology Co Ltd said on Wednesday it will spend 140 million yuan ($20.5 million) to improve its customer service after the recent murder of a passenger by her Didi driver exposed safety issues at the firm.
Cause_General	Didi founder Cheng Wei made the comments in a speech to government regulators who visited the company at the start of a nation-wide inspection of ride-hailing companies, the Chinese newspaper Beijing Daily said.
Cause_Specific	Didi has been under pressure since a passenger was raped and murdered by her driver last month.
Cause_Specific	It’s customer service team was criticized after the firm failed to act on a complaint made against the driver a few days before murder.
Cause_General	Didi, with backers that include Japan’s SoftBank Group Corp, Apple Inc and U.S-based ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies, is the world’s largest ride-hailing firm by number of rides and is expanding globally.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Didi said on Tuesday it would implement new measures to improve the safety of its platform and planned to suspend some late-night services in mainland China between Sept. 8-15 to phase in those measures.
Main	Didi, in an emailed statement to Reuters, confirmed the 140 million yuan investment and said it would fully cooperate with the visiting inspection team.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Didi said an 8,000-strong professional customer service team would be set up by the end of this year.
Cause_General	China’s Ministry of Transport said on its website the inspection team that visited Didi included staff from the government’s transportation, public security and emergency management departments.
Cause_General	The team would visit other ride-hailing firms including Shouqi and Tencent-backed Meituan Dianping, the ministry said.
Main	MERGERS and acquisitions have been booming, and investors looking for a way to profit from them have a simple solution at hand: they can invest in mutual funds that specialize in buying shares of companies that are being acquired.
Distant_Evaluation	But don't expect to make a killing.
Distant_Evaluation	These funds -- and there are at least five of them -- are generally considered to be having a good year if they double the returns on three-month Treasury bills.
Cause_General	Last year, the five funds returned 10.1 percent, on average, while T-bills averaged less than 5 percent, but still gained far less than the nearly 16 percent return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Cause_General	Over five years, the funds' return was 5.5 percent, annualized, compared with 6.2 percent for the S.& P.
Distant_Evaluation	Mainly, the funds offer extremely consistent gains from a highly diverse portfolio, and at the end of a year investors almost always have more than they did in January.
Cause_General	Consider the Merger Fund, the oldest and biggest at $1.5 billion.
Cause_General	It has had only one losing year out of 17.
Cause_General	The Gabelli ABC fund, the second-oldest and third-largest with $193 million in assets, is a perfect 13-0.
Distant_Evaluation	''What we do is fairly straightforward,'' said Frederick W. Green, president of the Merger Fund.
Distant_Evaluation	''We're the sleep-well-at-night fund.''
Cause_General	The gains come from buying shares in a company that is being acquired, but for less than the acquirer plans to pay, then cashing out when the deal is done.
Distant_Evaluation	Because, as Mr. Green says, 95 percent of the mergers are completed, generally within a matter of months, it's a pretty safe bet that buyers will earn the difference, or spread, between the two prices.
Distant_Evaluation	The favorable odds go a long way toward explaining why merger or risk arbitrage, as the strategy is known, produces returns that tend to be lower, on average, than those of other stock investments.
Distant_Evaluation	Investors trying to buy the shares after a merger announcement can't expect to get the stock for much less than the acquirer's offer, because the current shareholders can reasonably count on getting that price shortly.
Distant_Evaluation	How much less depends on a number of factors for both buyer and seller -- for example, what their money could reliably earn in another investment, like three-month Treasury bills, or the value attached to the 1-in-20 possibility that the deal will fall through (say, over regulatory problems).
Distant_Evaluation	When mergers are plentiful, as they are now, fund managers can pick their targets more carefully than usual.
Distant_Evaluation	And with interest rates having edged higher, the spreads have widened between the post-announcement market price and the offer price.
Cause_General	At times, some merger funds will short the stock of the acquirer as well as buy shares in the target company.
Cause_General	The tactic is similar to that used by hedge funds engaged in arbitrage, though without black-box secrecy or the risk of leveraging.
Cause_General	The price of the acquirer's shares tends to slip after the offer is made, so shorting those shares is a way to improve returns.
Cause_General	The five-year-old AXA Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions fund, the second-largest fund with $304 million in assets, adds a much riskier arbitrage strategy to the mix.
Cause_General	One-third of its capital is invested in companies that Mario J. Gabelli, the veteran money manager who oversees the fund along with his namesake ABC fund, regards as having the potential to be acquired.
Cause_General	For example, three companies in which he invests as takeover candidates are U.S. Cellular, Sensient Technologies and Cadbury Schweppes.
Distant_Evaluation	Potential takeover targets in general are more speculative investments than the traditional arbitrage plays.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If the main appeal of a company is its takeover potential and no offers materialize, its stock price may fall and give the fund a loss.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On the other hand, if the company is taken over, the fund gets the full measure of the premium the acquirer pays.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Such gambles increase risk, but may also improve total returns dramatically over the standard arbitrage performance -- as was the case in 2006 with AXA Enterprise.
Cause_General	For the year, according to Morningstar, AXA Enterprise gained 15.2 percent, more than three percentage points ahead of Gabelli ABC, the runner-up, at 12 percent.
Cause_General	They were followed by the Merger Fund, at 11 percent; the year-old, $7 million QCM Absolute Return fund, at 7 percent; and the six-year-old, $84 million Arbitrage fund, at 6.1 percent.
Cause_General	But while 2006 was a good year for the funds, not even AXA Enterprise quite caught up with the S.& P. index, which returned 15.8 percent for the year.
Cause_General	Over one-, three- and five-year stretches, the returns of the group averaged several percentage points below those of the S.& P.
Distant_Evaluation	Another concern is cost.
Cause_General	Four of the funds have expense ratios that are higher than the mutual fund average of 1.27 percent, according to S.& P. (And Enterprise has a front-end load, or sales charge, of 4.75 percent.)
Cause_General	The exception is Gabelli ABC, whose ratio is half the average.
Cause_General	But its minimum initial investment is $10,000 (though down from $50,000 in 2005), versus $2,000 or $2,500 at the other funds.
Cause_General	And investors can buy it only through Gamco Investors, Gabelli ABC's money management parent.
Distant_Evaluation	There are also taxes to consider.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''These funds deal in short-term trades, so if they make money there are going to be capital gains to pay,'' says Russel Kinnel, director of research at Morningstar.
Distant_Evaluation	''They're better for retirement portfolios.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Kinnel also says that these funds' returns may be squeezed over the long run by competition from hedge funds.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As the number of hedge funds increases and their war chests grow, more dollars are likely to be chasing a shrinking number of deals, since merger mania can't be expected to continue forever.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The growth in competition may be a compliment to the arbitrage strategy, but spreads would be likely to narrow, thus hurting the performance of all arbitrage funds.
Distant_Evaluation	Zoë Brunson, director of portfolio services at S.& P., suggests that if investors are convinced that the good times for mergers will continue, and want to profit directly, they have alternatives to arbitrage funds.
Distant_Evaluation	They might try small-cap funds, she said.
Distant_Evaluation	''You get your exposure to mergers and acquisitions because that's where a lot of them are,'' she said.
Distant_Evaluation	''You may take on more risk, but there's greater upside potential.Not that they're better.
Distant_Evaluation	It's just a matter of what you have an appetite for.''
Error	MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT
Main	(Reuters) - Tesla Inc said on Tuesday the U.S. Department of Justice was investigating Chief Executive Elon Musk’s public statements in August that he was considering taking the electric car maker private, the latest and biggest threat to Musk’s leadership.
Cause_General	The Justice Department asked Tesla for documents about Musk’s announcement, Tesla said, describing it as a “voluntary request.” The company said it was co-operating and that the matter “should be quickly resolved.”
Cause_General	The probe by the Justice Department, which can press criminal charges, comes on top of a civil probe by the Securities and Exchange Commission and shareholder lawsuits.
Cause_General	The Justice Department declined to comment.
Cause_General	Bloomberg reported earlier that federal prosecutors had opened a criminal fraud investigation.
Cause_General	Tesla did not say whether the Justice Department probe was criminal or civil.
Cause_Specific	Musk surprised investors on Aug. 7 with his plan to take Tesla private, tweeting that he had “funding secured” for a deal that would have valued the company at $72 billion.
Cause_Specific	In a separate tweet, he wrote: “Investor support is confirmed.”
Distant_Evaluation	Tesla’s shares rose after his tweet, but investors in the company’s bonds and convertible debt were skeptical that the tens of billions of dollars needed for the buyout would materialize.
Distant_Evaluation	After two weeks of uncertainty, particularly over funding, Musk abruptly abandoned the plan on Aug. 24, saying it would be even more time-consuming and distracting than anticipated, and that “most of Tesla’s existing shareholders believe we are better off as a public company.”
Cause_General	Tesla’s stock, which has lost about 25 percent since its gains after Musk first tweeted about going private, fell 3.5 percent to $284.50 on Tuesday.
Distant_Anecdotal	The SEC has already opened an inquiry into Musk’s tweets, according to one person with direct knowledge of the matter, and short-seller Citron Research has sued Musk over the truthfulness of his tweet about secured funding.
Cause_General	The SEC has not commented on the case.

Cause_General	Goldman Sachs and Silver Lake did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Cause_General	Tesla biggest institutional investor Baillie Gifford said last week it was questioned by the SEC about Musk’s plans to take the electric carmaker private.
Distant_Evaluation	An executive with the asset manager said the chief executive needed help running the company.
Distant_Evaluation	STRONG GOVERNMENT CASE?
Distant_Evaluation	“Any criminal investigation takes this up a level and creates more danger for the company and Musk,” said Peter Henning, a lawyer who has worked for the SEC and the Justice Department.
Distant_Evaluation	To charge Musk with a crime, the Justice Department would need to show that he intended to manipulate Tesla’s stock price, said Henning, now a law professor at Wayne State University.
Distant_Evaluation	For a civil enforcement action, the SEC would only need to show that Musk acted negligently, which is easier to prove, he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The SEC could subject Musk to civil sanctions such as fines, relinquishing improper profits and a ban on running public companies.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If the Justice Department brings criminal charges against Musk and a trial results in a guilty verdict, the 47-year-old billionaire could face jail time, in addition to any financial penalties, said Jay Dubow, a former branch chief in the SEC’s enforcement division.
Distant_Evaluation	Musk’s public antipathy to short-sellers of Tesla - who have sold stock and hope to make a profit by buying it back for less later on - may help the government make the case that he intended to hurt them by claiming funding was secured, said Eric Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.

Distant_Evaluation	“Musk said ‘funding secured,’ which is not a prediction, but a statement in the past tense which seems like a fact, and this could be a strong case from the government side,” said Gordon.
Distant_Evaluation	Musk’s recent behavior, which included smoking marijuana during a video interview, has raised concerns about his leadership, with several Wall Street analysts and some investors urging Tesla to appoint a strong second-in-command.
Distant_Evaluation	He has been under intense pressure to prove he can deliver consistent production numbers for the Model 3 sedan, which is crucial to Tesla’s plan to become a mass-market automaker.

Main	Prosecutors in the Balkan country said that the body of 30-year-old Viktoria Marinova was found in a park in Ruse on Saturday.
Cause_General	They identified her only by her initials.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is about rape and murder,” Interior Minister Mladen Marinov told reporters.
Distant_Evaluation	He said there was no evidence to suggest the murder was related to Marinova’s work and there was no information that she had been threatened.
Distant_Evaluation	Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov told reporters: “I am convinced it is a matter of time before the murder would be revealed.
Distant_Evaluation	The best criminologists were sent to Ruse, let’s not press them.
Distant_Evaluation	A large amount of DNA had been obtained.”
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Police are expected to disclose more details on Monday.
Main	“Her death was caused by blows to the head and suffocation, and her mobile phone, car keys, glasses and some of her clothing were missing,” Ruse regional prosecutor Georgy Georgiev said.
Cause_General	Marinova, who was a board member of the Ruse-based TV station TVN - one of the most popular TV channels in northeastern Bulgaria - is the third journalist to have been murdered in the European Union in a year.
Cause_General	Local media reported that Marinova had recently been involved in covering an investigation by a group of Bulgarian journalists into companies involved in EU-funded infrastructure projects administered by local authorities.
Distant_Historical	Last October Daphne Caruana Galizia, Malta’s best-known investigative journalist, was killed when a powerful bomb blew up her car [L8N1MR5CD] and Slovak journalist Jan Kuciak was shot dead in February.
Distant_Evaluation	“With great pain and insurmountable grief the TVN’s team is experiencing the loss of our beloved colleague Victoria Marinova and we pray for sympathy to the sorrow of her relatives and colleagues,” TVN said in a short statement.
Cause_General	Bulgaria ranked 111 out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index this year, lower than any other EU member and also lower than other countries in the western Balkans, some of which are candidates for EU membership.
Distant_Historical	In October 2017 hundreds of Bulgarian journalists protested in downtown Sofia downtown against threats from Deputy Prime Minister Valeri Simeonov against the country’s biggest broadcasters.
Distant_Historical	He accused the mainstream media of leading a “massive smear campaign” against him.
Distant_Evaluation	INSURANCE companies warn against them, some consumer advocates eye them with suspicion, and many potential clients are not even aware of what they do.
Distant_Evaluation	Public insurance adjusters, private claims experts who negotiate with insurers to win settlements for homeowners and businesses, are a misunderstood lot.
Distant_Anecdotal	Jarrod M. Fischer, an insurance adjuster based in Lake Success, N.Y., who specializes in high-end residential claims, estimates that half the people he meets have never heard the term.
Distant_Anecdotal	Yet, once ''we explain our service, 9 times out of 10 they'll hire me,'' Mr. Fischer said.
Main	After years of working in relative obscurity, mainly in the Northeast, public adjusters are becoming increasingly prominent in hurricane-torn Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana.
Cause_General	In Florida, where a decade of big storms has led to tighter insurance regulations, the profession is flourishing.
Main_Consequence	In the mid-1980's the state had only a handful of adjusters, primarily in Miami and Jacksonville; today there are more than 400, said Ray Altieri Jr., the president of Transco American Claims, a public adjuster firm in Tampa.
Cause_General	Only a fraction of homes in the hurricane zone were covered by federal flood insurance and residential reimbursement is capped at $250,000.
Distant_Evaluation	Additional reimbursement from a homeowner's policy can mean the difference between rebuilding and defaulting on a mortgage.
Distant_Evaluation	With or without flood insurance, ''the public adjuster is going to identify a greater amount of loss and damage than a homeowner ever would on their own,'' said Leslie L. Knox, the president of Andrew K. Knox & Company in Toms River, N.J., and the incoming president of the National Association of Public Insurance Adjusters, a trade group.
Cause_Specific	In the weeks following Katrina, with the number of claims rising -- up to 1.75 million as of Jan. 31, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group -- Louisiana and Mississippi, which had not previously licensed public adjusters, issued emergency directives allowing them to operate once they register with the respective insurance departments.
Main_Consequence	By December, 495 adjusters had done so in Mississippi; in Louisiana, the number is 1,170.
Main_Consequence	After Katrina hit, Ron Delo, the president of Insurance Claim Consultants, a public adjuster firm in Tampa, tripled his staff to nine, including two in Florida and two in Louisiana.
Cause_General	Mr. Delo said his company is working with about 275 residential clients with hurricane-related claims.
Cause_General	The claims were averaging $150,000 to $250,000, he said.
Cause_General	Public adjusters, who work on contingency and earn a percentage of the claim, take inventory, hire appraisers and engineers, and negotiate with insurance companies over the extent of coverage and the cost of repairs.
Distant_Evaluation	Adjusters say they offer practical knowledge based on the kind of familiarity with the claims process that few homeowners ever have.
Distant_Evaluation	And people who are reeling from the impact of a disaster often appreciate having a consultant to lean on.
Distant_Evaluation	''My wife and I were in shock,'' said Dennis Hersch, referring to an electrical fire that damaged their triplex apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 2004.
Distant_Evaluation	''One minute your life is all normal and the next minute I had 30 to 40 firefighters trudging through the place.
Distant_Evaluation	Everything smelled of smoke.
Distant_Evaluation	There was broken glass.
Distant_Evaluation	It was a nightmare.''
Distant_Historical	Mr. Hersch, the global chairman of mergers and acquisitions at J. P. Morgan, and his wife, Huguette, hired Mr. Fischer, who works for the Affiliated Adjustment Group, after he knocked on the Hersches' door after the fire.
Distant_Evaluation	Ten months later, Mr. Hersch said, he received a ''very fair'' settlement from the insurance company, close to $400,000.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Fischer's cut was 8 percent, less than the 12.5 percent rate cap under New York State law.
Cause_General	Controversy over the adjusters' middleman role has risen right along with their numbers.
Distant_Evaluation	Mississippi, in particular, had been seen as hostile to the practice.
Cause_General	When the emergency directive to license them was being discussed, regulators pushed for a 2 percent cap on fees.
Cause_General	The cap was set at 7 percent, but as part of the directive adjusters are allowed only to assess values and costs and to file a claim -- they may not negotiate with an insurer over coverage.
Distant_Evaluation	In Louisiana last November, the insurance commissioner, J. Robert Wooley, warned that some public adjusters ''take advantage of consumers,'' and that some contractors approach homeowners saying they are public adjusters in order to get work.
Distant_Anecdotal	A spokeswoman for the insurance industry -- which is where many adjusters get their start -- argued that consumers can deal directly with the insurance companies on claims, using an in-house adjuster free of charge.
Distant_Evaluation	And Bob Hunter, the director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America, the national advocacy group, agrees.
Distant_Evaluation	''Why would you want someone to take a piece of your money?''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Hunter asked.
Distant_Evaluation	''If you really feel like you're getting a runaround from the insurance company and they're really treating you rudely, go to a lawyer.''
Distant_Evaluation	But some homeowners say they appreciate having a hand when they are feeling vulnerable and overwhelmed.
Distant_Evaluation	As with any contractor, homeowners should ask for references.
Distant_Evaluation	In states that recognize the profession -- Mississippi and Louisiana aside, 38 out of the 50 do, including Connecticut and New Jersey -- adjusters should be licensed, checkable through the state's insurance department.
Distant_Evaluation	Bill Bailey, the outside counsel for the Insurance Information Institute, and the managing director of its Hurricane Insurance Information Center, says the right adjuster can make all the difference.
Distant_Evaluation	He tells the story of the time his wife, Irene, was managing a building in Boston and one Friday night in the dead of winter its boiler exploded.
Distant_Evaluation	Unable to reach the insurer, she authorized emergency repairs.
Distant_Evaluation	The insurer turned down the claim, saying she had violated the policy; a public adjuster helped turn that decision around.
Distant_Evaluation	''They can be extremely helpful as long as you know what you're getting,'' Mr. Bailey said.

Main	LOS ANGELES, Aug. 7 (Xinhua) -- Politicians voted Monday night to urge for the removal of President Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, West Hollywood mayor said.
Cause_Specific	"West Hollywood Mayor John Duran and Councilwoman Lindsey Horvath offered a resolution Monday night urging the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove the president's star ""due to his disturbing treatment of women and other actions that do not meet the shared values of the City of West Hollywood, the region, state, and country."""
Main	The City Council voted unanimously, and passed the resolution.
Cause_General	The decision will ultimately be up to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
Main	"""West Hollywood City council unanimously passes resolution asking the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to remove the Donald Trump star on Hollywood Walk of Fame,"" the Mayor posted on Twitter."
Cause_Specific	"The council's staff report on the resolution also cited the Trump administration's separation of immigrant families at the U.S. border and Trump's ""denial of findings from the United States intelligence community regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election and continued refusal to hold Russia accountable for its crimes."""
Cause_General	The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has never removed a marker from the Walk of Fame and turned down a 2015 request to remove comedian Bill Cosby's star.
Cause_General	Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been vandalized repeatedly in recent years.
Cause_General	In regard to the most recent vandalism, a man accused of smashing Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a pickaxe was charged Monday with felony vandalism, according to the City News Service, a local news outlet.
Distant_Evaluation	Following the vandalism, the CEO of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, which administers the Walk of Fame, urged would-be vandals to vote if they wanted to make a political statement.
Distant_Historical	Trump earned his star back in 2007.
Cause_General	Trump's star is currently boarded over.
Distant_Historical	In 1997, as the government listened in on their phone call, Adham Hassoun, a computer programmer in Broward County, Fla., proposed a road trip to Jose Padilla, a low-wage worker there.
Distant_Historical	The excursion to Tampa would be his treat, Mr. Hassoun said, and a chance to meet ''some nice, uh, brothers.''
Cause_General	Mr. Padilla, 36, a Brooklyn-born Puerto Rican who had converted to Islam a few years earlier, knew Mr. Hassoun, an outspoken Palestinian, from his mosque.
Distant_Historical	Still, according to a transcript of the conversation obtained by The New York Times, Mr. Padilla equivocated as Mr. Hassoun exhorted.
Distant_Historical	''We take the whole family and have a blast,'' Mr. Hassoun said.
Distant_Historical	''We go to, uh, our Busch Gardens, you know You won't regret it.
Distant_Historical	Money-back guarantee.''
Distant_Historical	Mr. Padilla, laughing, suggested that they not discuss the matter over the phone.
Distant_Historical	''Why?''
Distant_Historical	Mr. Hassoun said.
Distant_Historical	''We're going to Busch Gardens.
Distant_Historical	What's the big deal!''
Cause_General	That conversation took place five years before Mr. Padilla, a United States citizen accused of plotting a ''dirty bomb'' attack against this country, was declared an enemy combatant.
Distant_Evaluation	Given that Mr. Padilla and Mr. Hassoun are now criminal defendants in a terrorism conspiracy case in Miami, it sounds suspicious, as if Mr. Hassoun were proposing something more sinister than a weekend at the amusement park.
Distant_Evaluation	He well may have been -- but maybe, too, he was sincere or joking about a Muslim retreat.
Distant_Evaluation	Deciphering such chatter in order to construct a convincing narrative of conspiracy is a challenge.
Cause_General	Yet, prosecutors say, the government will rely largely on wiretapped conversations when it puts Mr. Padilla, Mr. Hassoun, and a third defendant, Kifah Jayyousi, on trial as a ''North American support cell'' that sent money, goods and recruits abroad to assist ''global jihad.''
Cause_General	Tens of thousands of conversations were recorded.
Cause_General	Some 230 phone calls form the core of the government's case, including 21 that make reference to Mr. Padilla, prosecutors said.
Cause_General	But Mr. Padilla's voice is heard on only seven calls.
Cause_General	And on those seven, which The Times obtained from a participant in the case, Mr. Padilla does not discuss violent plots.
Distant_Historical	But this is not the version of Mr. Padilla -- Al Qaeda associate and would-be bomber -- that John Ashcroft, then the attorney general, unveiled in 2002 when he interrupted a trip to Moscow to trumpet Mr. Padilla's capture.
Cause_General	In the four and a half years since then, as the government tested the limits of its power to deal with terrorism outside the traditional law enforcement system, Mr. Padilla is the only accused terrorist to have gone from enemy combatant to criminal defendant.
Main	His criminal trial, scheduled to begin late this month, will feature none of the initial claims about violent plotting with Al Qaeda that the government cited as justification for detaining Mr. Padilla without formal charges for three and a half years.
Cause_General	Those claims came from the government's overseas interrogations of terrorism suspects, like Abu Zubaydah, which, the government said, Mr. Padilla corroborated, in part, during his own questioning in a military brig in South Carolina.
Cause_General	But, constrained by strict federal rules of evidence that would prohibit or limit the use of information obtained during such interrogations, the government will make a far more circumscribed case against Mr. Padilla in court, effectively demoting him from Al Qaeda's dirty bomber to foot soldier in a somewhat nebulous conspiracy.
Cause_General	The initial dirty bomb accusation did not disappear.
Cause_General	It quietly resurfaced in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba.
Cause_General	The government filed the dirty bomb charges against Mr. Padilla's supposed accomplice, an Ethiopian-born detainee, at about the same time it indicted Mr. Padilla on relatively lesser offenses in criminal court.
Cause_General	A Change in Strategy
Distant_Evaluation	The change in Mr. Padilla's status, from enemy combatant to criminal defendant, was abrupt.
Distant_Historical	It came late in 2005 as the Supreme Court was weighing whether to take up the legality of his military detention and the Bush administration, by filing criminal charges, pre-empted its review.
Distant_Evaluation	In a way, Mr. Padilla's prosecution was a legal maneuver that kept the issue of his detention without charges out of the Supreme Court.
Distant_Historical	After apprehending him at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in May 2002, the Bush administration made a choice: to detain Mr. Padilla militarily, in order to thwart further plotting, rather than to follow him in order to gather evidence that might serve a criminal prosecution.
Distant_Evaluation	Now that Mr. Padilla has ended up a criminal defendant after all, the prosecution's case does not fully reflect the Bush administration's view of who he is or what he did.
Cause_General	Senior government officials have said publicly that Mr. Padilla provided self-incriminating information during interrogations, admitting, they said, to undergoing basic terrorist training, to accepting an assignment to blow up apartment buildings in the United States, and to attending a farewell dinner with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the suspected master planner of the Sept. 11 attacks, before he flew to Chicago in 2002.
Cause_General	But any confessions by Mr. Padilla while he was detained without charges and denied access to counsel -- whether or not he was mistreated, as his lawyers claim -- would not be admissible in court.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	And it is unlikely that information obtained during the harsh questioning of Al Qaeda detainees would be admissible, either -- and, further, the government is disinclined to expose sensitive intelligence or invite further scrutiny of secret jails overseas.
Main	Probably as a consequence, the current criminal case zeroes in on what the government sees as an earlier stage of Mr. Padilla's involvement with terrorism.
Main	It focuses primarily on the other defendants' support during the 1990s for Muslim struggles overseas, especially in Bosnia, Kosovo and Chechnya.
Main	Mr. Padilla, who was appended to their pre-existing case, in which he had been an unnamed co-conspirator, is depicted as their recruit.
Cause_General	Although prosecutors have declined to discuss the government's strategy, their filings and statements in court provide a picture of the case they are expected to present at trial.
Distant_Historical	The most tangible allegation against Mr. Padilla is that in 2000 he filled out, under an alias, an Arab-language application to attend a terrorist training camp.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	That application is expected to be offered into evidence alongside the wiretapped conversations, but Mr. Padilla's lawyers say they will contest its admissibility, challenging the government's assertion that the ''mujahideen data form'' belonged to their client.
Distant_Evaluation	Robert Chesney, a specialist in national security law at Wake Forest University, called the prosecution a pragmatic one, analogous to ''going after Al Capone on tax evasion.''
Distant_Evaluation	But Deborah Pearlstein, a lawyer with Human Rights First who has consulted with Mr. Padilla's defense, said that his will never be an ordinary, pragmatic prosecution.
Distant_Evaluation	''If Jose Padilla were from Day 1 just charged and tried, then maybe,'' she said.
Distant_Evaluation	''But this is a case that comes after three and a half years of the most gross deprivation of human rights that we've seen in this country for a long time.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Further, Ms. Pearlstein noted, the government has reserved the option, should the prosecution fail, of returning Mr. Padilla to the military brig.
Distant_Evaluation	This, she said, ''casts a shadow'' over the current prosecution.
Distant_Evaluation	The Bush administration's military case against Binyam Mohamed, 28, the Ethiopian detainee at Guantánamo, put the current proceedings in a different light, too.
Distant_Historical	In December 2005, Mr. Mohamed was referred to the military commission in Guantánamo on accusations that he conspired with Mr. Padilla on the dirty bomb plot.
Distant_Historical	It was little noticed at the time.
Cause_General	But accusations against Mr. Padilla that are nowhere to be found in the indictment against him filled the pages of Mr. Mohamed's charging sheet, with Mr. Padilla repeatedly identified by name.
Cause_General	The sheet referred to the two men meeting in Pakistan after Sept. 11, 2001, studying how to build an improvised dirty bomb, discussing the feasibility of a dirty bomb attack with Al Qaeda officials and agreeing to undertake the mission to blow up buildings.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Mohamed's lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said that these charges were based on a forced confession by Mr. Mohamed, who, he said, was tortured overseas into admitting to a story that was fed to him.
Distant_Evaluation	''Binyam was told all along that his job was to be a witness against Padilla, Abu Zubaydah and Khaled Sheikh Mohammed,'' Mr. Stafford Smith said, adding that his client ''has no conscience knowledge that he ever met'' Mr. Padilla.
Cause_General	The charges against Mr. Mohamed and other Guantánamo detainees who were headed for prosecution there have been suspended temporarily as a result of the Military Commissions Act passed by Congress in October.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Those charges are likely to be reinstated, a Pentagon official said yesterday.
Distant_Evaluation	That Mr. Mohamed faced dirty bomb charges and Mr. Padilla does not speaks to the central difference between being a terrorism suspect in Guantánamo and a criminal defendant charged with terrorism offenses in the United States.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In Guantánamo, the military commission system that deals with foreign-born terrorism suspects is expected to allow, with some exceptions, the use of information obtained through coercion.
Distant_Evaluation	''Federal court rules are restrictive,'' Professor Chesney of Wake Forest University School of Law said.
Distant_Evaluation	''The very essence of why they're trying to have that separate military system was to create rules to use information that is deemed by the intelligence community to be trustworthy but wouldn't make it under the federal rules of evidence.''
Distant_Evaluation	David Cole, a professor of law at Georgetown University and author of books on terrorism and civil liberties, sees the difference between the two systems more critically: ''What this says clearly is that they feel that they can get away with using tainted evidence in the military commission system that they can't use in the criminal court system.''
Cause_General	The Wiretapping Case
Distant_Evaluation	The criminal case against Mr. Padilla has its roots in the prosecution of Sheikh Omer Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who was convicted in 1995 of conspiring to blow up the United Nations and other New York landmarks.
Distant_Historical	In the early 1990s, Sheikh Rahman's telephone was tapped, and Mr. Hassoun and Dr. Jayyousi, a Jordanian-born American citizen who holds a doctorate in civil engineering, came to the government's attention through phone calls to or from his line.
Distant_Historical	Then the government, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, began to eavesdrop on them, which eventually pulled Mr. Padilla into their net, too.
Distant_Evaluation	The government presents the three defendants as ''joined at the hip,'' as one prosecutor put it in a hearing last summer.
Distant_Evaluation	But Judge Marcia G. Cooke of Federal District Court, noting that Mr. Padilla was appended to a case well under way, asked the government, ''If they are so joined at the hip, why is Mr. Padilla so late to the dance?''
Distant_Evaluation	Dr. Jayyousi, a former school system administrator in both Detroit and Washington, D.C., never met Mr. Padilla, his lawyer, William Swor, said.
Distant_Evaluation	It is Mr. Hassoun, the government said, who recruited Mr. Padilla.
Distant_Evaluation	But both Mr. Hassoun's and Mr. Padilla's lawyers deny that Mr. Padilla was recruited.
Distant_Historical	Seven Taped Phone Calls
Distant_Historical	Mr. Padilla's lawyers and relatives say that he left South Florida for Egypt in September 1998 on a spiritual journey.
Distant_Evaluation	A former juvenile offender, he converted to Islam as part of an effort to straighten out his life, they say.
Distant_Historical	His mosque in Fort Lauderdale sponsored his travel, he told friends, relatives and F.B.I.
Distant_Historical	agents who interviewed him in 2002.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Hassoun belonged to that mosque, and the telephone transcripts seem to indicate that Mr. Hassoun helped, at the least, with Mr. Padilla's travel plans.
Distant_Historical	The seven taped phone calls that bear Mr. Padilla's voice involve conversations with Mr. Hassoun from 1997 to 2000.
Distant_Historical	On those calls, Mr. Padilla, unlike some of the other defendants, does not employ what the government says is coded language.
Distant_Evaluation	According to the government, other defendants refer to their jihad-related plans as ''getting some fresh air,'' ''participating in tourism,'' ''opening up a market,'' ''playing football,'' and so on.
Distant_Evaluation	This leads to silly-sounding exchanges where ''the brothers'' discuss going on ''picnics'' in order ''to smell fresh air and to eat cheese'' or using $3,500 to buy ''zucchini.''
Distant_Evaluation	In contrast, Mr. Padilla's seven conversations with Mr. Hassoun range from straightforward -- Mr. Hassoun tells Mr. Padilla that his grandmother has died; Mr. Padilla tells Mr. Hassoun that he has found himself an 18-year-old Egyptian bride who is willing to wear a veil -- to vaguely suggestive or just odd.
Distant_Historical	In one phone call, the two men talked about a dream.
Distant_Evaluation	It appeared to be the dream that Mr. Padilla, according to his relatives, cites as having played a crucial role in inspiring him to convert to Islam: the vision of a man in a turban, surrounded by the swirling dust of a desert.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Hassoun brought it up and told Mr. Padilla that he himself had experienced the same vision.
Distant_Historical	''What do you mean you saw the same dream?''
Distant_Historical	Mr. Padilla asked.
Distant_Historical	''I saw the dream of the uh person with the turban,'' Mr. Hassoun said.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Hassoun explained how, in his dream, the turban was wrongly wrapped and so he thought the man might be a spy, in which case, he was prepared ''to split his body apart.''
Distant_Historical	But then, he said, he understood that ''the brother was a good one.''
Distant_Historical	''Yeah?''
Distant_Historical	Mr. Padilla said.
Distant_Evaluation	In three of the seven conversations, Mr. Padilla made statements that the government has identified as ''overt acts'' in furtherance of the accused conspiracy.
Distant_Historical	In the first, Mr. Hassoun asked, ''You're ready, right?''
Distant_Historical	and Mr. Padilla said, ''God willing, brother, it's going to happen soon.''
Distant_Historical	That was the summer of 1997, a year before Mr. Padilla left South Florida for Egypt.
Distant_Historical	In the second, Mr. Padilla told Mr. Hassoun, during a 1999 conversation from Egypt, that he had asked his ex-wife in the United States to arrange for him to receive an army jacket, a book bag and a sleeping bag, supplies that he had requested because ''there was a rumor here that the door was open somewhere.''
Distant_Historical	In the third, Mr. Padilla told Mr. Hassoun in April 2000, that he would need a recommendation to ''connect me with the good brothers, with the right faith'' if he were to travel to Yemen.
Distant_Evaluation	Prosecutors say Mr. Padilla is mentioned, although by his Muslim name Ibrahim or by another alias, on 21 additional tapes.
Distant_Evaluation	One of them refers to Ibrahim as being ''in the area of Usama,'' which the government takes to mean that he was near Osama bin Laden.
Cause_General	But Mr. Padilla's lawyers contest that interpretation.
Distant_Evaluation	''That is just nonsensical, Your Honor, that these men who for years, according to the government, have been talking in code all of a sudden are going to throw Osama bin Laden's name around,'' Michael Caruso, a federal public defender, said in court.
Cause_General	Mr. Padilla has pleaded not guilty.
Cause_General	But before his case goes before a jury, his fitness to stand trial will be evaluated.
Cause_General	On the basis of Mr. Padilla's lawyers' assertion that he is mentally damaged as a result of his prolonged isolation and his interrogation in the brig, Judge Cooke has ordered a psychiatric evaluation by a Bureau of Prisons doctor to be completed this week.
Error	Friday in The Times: The only person on the American mainland still held asan enemy combatant.
Cause_General	Correction: January 5, 2007, Friday A front-page article yesterday about wiretapped conversations in the case against Jose Padilla, who is accused of plotting a ''dirty bomb'' attack, omitted two lines at the continuation in some copies.
Cause_General	The sentence should have read: ''In the four and a half years since then, as the government tested the limits of its power to deal with terrorism outside the traditional law enforcement system, Mr. Padilla is the only accused terrorist to have gone from enemy combatant to criminal defendant.''
Main	HOLDEN BEACH, N.C. (Reuters) - More than 1 million people along the Carolina coast fled toward higher ground on Monday in a mass evacuation ordered three days before the expected arrival of Hurricane Florence, a Category 4 storm and the most powerful to menace the region in nearly three decades.
Main	With maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour (220 kph), Florence was due to grow even stronger before making landfall on Thursday, mostly likely in southeastern North Carolina near the South Carolina border, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Authorities also warned of life-threatening coastal storm surges and the potential for Florence to unleash prolonged torrential rains and widespread flooding across several states, especially if it lingers inland for several days.
Distant_Evaluation	“Florence is expected to be an extremely dangerous major hurricane through Thursday,” the NHC said in its latest bulletin.
Distant_Evaluation	North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper told a news conference his state was in “the bull’s eye.”
Main_Consequence	Cooper and his counterparts in South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland all declared states of emergency.
Main_Consequence	Mindful of devastation wrought by a string of deadly U.S. hurricanes last year, jittery residents in the Carolinas began the rituals of disaster preparation - boarding up windows and stocking up on groceries, water and gasoline.
Main	Classified as a Category 4 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength, Florence stood as the most severe storm to threaten the U.S. mainland this year and the first of its magnitude to take aim at the Carolinas since 1989, when Hurricane Hugo barreled over Charleston, South Carolina.
Main_Consequence	As a precaution against Florence, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster ordered an estimated 1 million coastal residents in his state to move inland.
Main_Consequence	Mandatory evacuation orders also were issued for more than 50,000 people from Hatteras and Ocracoke, the southernmost of North Carolina’s Outer Banks barrier islands.
Main_Consequence	At least 250,000 more were due to be evacuated from the northern Outer Banks on Tuesday, along with some coastal Virginia residents.
Main_Consequence	Emergency management officials reported waves already starting to crash over Hatteras Island’s main highway where dunes were breached by heavy surf, slowing traffic to a crawl.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Traffic was backed up for about 9 miles (14 km) in places,” said Paul Jones, a retiree who owns a home on the island.
Main_Consequence	U.S. President Donald Trump, whose administration was criticized as being slow to respond to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year, canceled a political rally planned for Friday in Jackson, Mississippi, over safety concerns related to Florence, his campaign said.

Distant_Evaluation	Coastal properties were especially vulnerable to possible flooding from the hurricane’s storm surge, which according to the California-based risk assessment service CoreLogic, will put more than 758,000 homes in the Carolinas and Virginia at risk.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	NHC Director Ken Graham also warned of “staggering” amounts of rainfall that may extend hundreds of miles inland and cause flash flooding across the mid-Atlantic region.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Forecasts call for 10 to 15 inches (25-38 cm) of rain in the hardest-hit areas, possibly more if the storm stalls over land, as expected, Graham said.
Distant_Evaluation	Virginia’s emergency operations chief, Jeffrey Stern, told reporters that residents should brace for “something that no one in Virginia has experienced in their lifetimes.”
Main	MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian lawmakers on Thursday voted to postpone the second reading of a bill being discussed in the lower house of parliament that would make it a crime to comply with Western sanctions on Russia.

Cause_Specific	The lower house said it would hold talks next week with businesses before proceeding further with discussion of the draft law, a day after business lobby groups on Wednesday publicly voiced opposition to it.
Cause_Specific	“We support postponing (discussion) for further consultations because of numerous appeals and insufficient legal preparation,” said Nikolai Kolomeytsev, a lawmaker for the Communist party, which often backs the Kremlin on important issues.
Cause_Specific	Russian lawmakers in a first reading on Tuesday approved a bill making it a crime punishable by up to four years in jail to refuse to supply services or do business with a Russian citizen, citing U.S. or other sanctions.
Distant_Evaluation	The Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs said in a statement on Wednesday that the bill creates risks of unreasonable criminal prosecution of Russian and foreign citizens, and could harm the investment climate.
Cause_General	Business representatives will be invited to discuss the bill with lawmakers next Wednesday.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“I think we can find a construction under which these fears can be removed.
Distant_Evaluation	And then the law will pass without any fears and, generally speaking, we need it,” lawmaker Valery Gartung said on Thursday.
Cause_General	He is a member of the Just Russia party which often allies itself with the Kremlin.
Cause_General	The bill is one of two items of legislation drawn up by lawmakers in response to the United States’ decision to impose sanctions on Russia last month.
Cause_General	Washington blacklisted some of Russia’s biggest companies and businessmen, striking at allies of President Vladimir Putin to punish Moscow for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and other “malign activities”.
Cause_General	Later on Thursday, lawmakers in a second reading approved the second item of legislation.
Cause_General	The bill would give the government authority to ban trade in certain items with countries deemed to be unfriendly to Moscow.
Cause_General	Under the bill, the Russian president would decide which products would be affected by the restrictions, and any decision would be subject to approval from parliament.

Cause_General	The legislation also bars affected countries and those countries’ citizens from taking part in the privatization of Russian property.
Distant_Evaluation	The legislation has been diluted since it was first put forward.
Cause_General	Lawmakers originally proposed restricting imports of U.S.-made software and farm goods, U.S. medicines that can be sourced elsewhere, and tobacco and alcohol.
Cause_General	The legislation must pass a third reading, before being approved by the upper house of parliament and signed by President Vladimir Putin.

Main	COLOMBO, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government on Friday said it is aiming to attract 3 billion U.S. dollars worth of foreign direct investments in 2019 as several mega projects were being discussed with international investors.
Cause_General	Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama, quoted in local media reports said Sri Lanka had drawn an estimated 2.2 billion dollars worth of FDIs last year, which was an all-time high.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We are still reviewing the final statistics, which may be released towards the end of this month."
Distant_Evaluation	"However, I think we will end up with 2.2 billion U.S. dollars for 2018,"" the minister said."
Distant_Evaluation	He added some of the foreign investments expected in 2018 had unfortunately been delayed due to the political instability experienced towards the later part of the year.
Cause_General	"""We are re-discussing those investments."
Cause_General	We are negotiating on a huge refinery and a steel manufacturing plant in Trincomalee, in eastern Sri Lanka.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"If these investments come in we will have a substantial inflow of FDIs by end of this year,"" Samarawickrama said."
Distant_Historical	In 2017, Sri Lanka received FDIs worth 1.63 billion dollars with China bringing in the highest FDI followed by India and Singapore.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Sri Lankan government is aiming to attract 5 billion dollars worth of FDIs per year by 2020.

Main	RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- Massive protests led by Brazilian women of different political affiliations shook Brazil on Saturday, as hundreds of thousands people gathered to reject the leading presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro.
Main	The large-scale protests took place in at least 62 major cities, gathering women and men of different ages, ethnic groups, sexual orientations, social classes and political parties, campaigning for voters to choose any of 13 presidential candidates - except Bolsonaro.
Cause_General	The largest event took place in Sao Paulo, where around 500,000 people participated.
Cause_General	Hundreds of thousands people also gathered in Rio de Janeiro and Recife.
Cause_General	In addition, protests were held in several foreign countries such as Argentina, France, Germany, Chile and Spain.
Cause_General	The protests were first organized via social media under the hashtag #EleNao (NotHim) by a Facebook group named 'Women against Bolsonaro', founded in August.
Cause_General	The protests quickly gathered millions of members - now over 3.8 million.
Distant_Anecdotal	Bolsonaro's ideas for public security, including drastically reducing gun control and shielding police officers from being prosecuted for the murder of innocents, were opposed by a group called Antifascist Policemen, said Janaina Matos, a police officer who believes in new public policies to fight crime.
Distant_Anecdotal	Today, the greatest enemy of indigenous people in Brazil is Bolsonaro, said Papion Santos, an indigenous activist.
Distant_Evaluation	The candidate's distaste for indigenous population is well-known, and he stated during the campaign that he would stop the demarcation of indigenous lands completely and his government would not surrender one centimeter to indigenous people in Brazil.
Distant_Anecdotal	Defending indigenous lands is defending the planet, Santos told Xinhua, hoping Brazil's new president will listen to the demands of indigenous people and other vulnerable groups.
Distant_Evaluation	Bolsonaro, who has some 25 to 30 percent of voting intentions according to the latest polls, is widely considered to be sexist, racist, homophobic and even fascist.
Cause_General	He became widely popular in recent years, claiming to be an honest politician concerned about public security and traditional values.
Distant_Evaluation	That stance has helped him with right-wing voters; he is popular among the rich and has a strong advantage in the southeast and south regions.
Distant_Evaluation	However, repeated statements against gender equality and open hostility toward minorities in general increased his rejection rate significantly in recent months.
Cause_General	According to the latest Datafolha poll, 52 percent of Brazilian women and 54 percent of black citizens would not vote for Bolsonaro under any circumstances.
Cause_General	In the poorer northeastern region, Bolsonaro's rejection hits 61 percent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A week before the election, massive protests against the candidate are likely to dominate the news in the next few days.
Distant_Evaluation	Bolsonaro left the hospital earlier on Saturday - he was stabbed by an apparent lone wolf on Sept. 6 - and will certainly be questioned by rivals and reporters over his difficulties in dealing with half of the electorate.
Distant_Evaluation	In a TV interview aired on Friday, he minimized the importance of the groups that oppose him, although critics say rejecting a large bloc of voters may be unwise.
Main	ABU DHABI/LONDON (Reuters) - Baker Hughes, the world’s second-largest oil services company, will take a 5 percent stake in Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s (ADNOC) drilling unit for $550 million under a tie-up announced on Monday.
Cause_General	Baker Hughes (BHGE) becomes the first foreign company to take a stake in one of state-owned ADNOC’s services companies under the agreement which values ADNOC Drilling at about $11 billion.
Cause_General	It will allow Baker Hughes to cement its presence in the Middle East, the fastest growing region for oil and gas operations, and enable ADNOC Drilling to gain access to the know-how and technical expertise of a global player.
Cause_General	Since its acquisition by General Electric Co last year, Baker Hughes has sought new business models following a sharp decline in global drilling activity since 2014.
Cause_General	That includes offering a suite of services to oil and gas producers from exploration to drilling.
Distant_Evaluation	“To us this is not just another partnership... this will allow ADNOC Drilling to be not only a local player but a global specialist in the drilling and oil service business,” ADNOC’s Chief Executive Sultan al-Jaber told Reuters in an interview in Abu Dhabi.
Distant_Evaluation	It would help make ADNOC Drilling “the most efficient and the most competitive,” al-Jaber said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Baker Hughes’ CEO Lorenzo Simonelli said BHGE will have a representative on the board of ADNOC Drilling and will create a dedicated training team.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The partnership will offer drilling services in the UAE and possibly abroad as well, al-Jaber said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The transaction is expected to close before the end of this year, with operations starting in 2019, ADNOC and BHGE said in a joint statement.
Distant_Evaluation	Al-Jaber said “there are no plans at this point of time” to float a stake in ADNOC Drilling.
Distant_Evaluation	While analysts said the deal would bode well for Baker Hughes’ long-term prospects in the United Arab Emirates, some lamented that the firm was paying too high a price in its acquisition.
Distant_Evaluation	“We’re just not fans of OFS (oilfield service) companies having to ante up” to tap into revenue growth, analysts for investment firm Tudor Pickering Holt & Co wrote in a note on Monday.
Cause_General	Shares of Baker Hughes were down roughly 1 percent at midday on Monday, trading around $31.65.
Cause_General	Moelis is acting as the financial adviser to ADNOC on the transaction, while Citi is the adviser to BHGE, the two companies said in the statement.
Main	(Reuters) - A Texas man at the center of a legal battle over his plan to make instructions available for 3-D printed plastic guns flew to Taiwan after learning police in Austin were investigating an accusation he had sex with an underage girl, police said on Wednesday.
Cause_Specific	Cody Wilson, 30, was placed under investigation after a counsellor on Aug. 22 told police that a 16-year-old girl had said she was paid $500 to have sex with Wilson at an Austin hotel, Austin Police Commander Troy Officer said at a news conference.
Main	Police later interviewed the girl and on Wednesday obtained a warrant for Wilson’s arrest, but by then he had caught a flight to Taiwan, Officer said.
Cause_General	“We know Mr. Wilson frequently travels for business.
Cause_General	We don’t know why he went to Taiwan,” Officer said.
Cause_General	“But we do know before he left he was informed by a friend of the victim that she had spoken to police and the police were investigating him for having sex with a minor.”
Cause_General	Taiwan does not have an extradition treaty with the United States.
Cause_General	The island’s Criminal Investigation Bureau told Reuters on Thursday that it had not received any request on the matter from the United States, and it was not immediately clear whether Wilson was in Taiwan.
Cause_General	Wilson founded the group Defense Distributed, which has been selling 3-D firearm-design files on flash drives via regular mail after a U.S. federal judge barred the group from posting the blueprints online.
Cause_General	A lawyer for Wilson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Cause_Specific	In an Aug. 27 interview with police, the teenager said she had exchanged messages with a man using the screen name “Sanjuro” on SugarDaddyMeet.com, according to a police affidavit.
Cause_Specific	The girl said “Sanjuro” later revealed his real name, described himself as a “big deal” and exchanged nude photos with her.The girl said she and Wilson had sex at a local hotel on Aug. 15, according to the document.
Cause_Specific	Her statement was corroborated with security video footage and records showing Wilson registered as a guest at the hotel that night, police said.
Distant_Historical	Wilson sparked a legal battle in 2015 after he challenged a government ban on posting the blueprints for printing 3-D guns to the internet, claiming it infringed on his rights to free speech and to bear arms.
Error	Slideshow (3 Images)
Distant_Historical	The Trump administration earlier this year reached a settlement lifting the ban for Defense Distributed.
Distant_Historical	But 19 states and the District of Columbia challenged that decision in court in July, arguing that publishing the blueprints would allow criminals easy access to unregistered weapons.
Cause_General	Last month, U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik in Seattle ordered Wilson not to post blueprints online.
Cause_General	Instead, Wilson began selling them by mail, saying the judge’s order did not bar him from doing so.

Main	TOKYO (Reuters) - Rising raw material costs and a string of natural disasters that disrupted production sapped business confidence among Japan’s big manufacturers in the September quarter, a central bank survey showed on Monday, taking it to the lowest in more than a year.
Error	FILE PHOTO: Employees work an assembly line at a factory of Glory Ltd., a manufacturer of automatic change dispensers, in Kazo, north of Tokyo, Japan, July 1, 2015.

Distant_Evaluation	The survey gave little indication underlying sentiment had been hit by escalating global trade frictions.
Distant_Evaluation	But the specter of a fully-fledged trade war weighed on companies’ business outlook, which could threaten otherwise brisk capital expenditure, a bright spot in the world’s third largest economy.
Distant_Evaluation	The survey casts doubt on the Bank of Japan’s view that a solid economic expansion will help accelerate inflation to its elusive 2 percent target, although there were some signs that companies were gradually passing costs to their customers.
Distant_Evaluation	“Sentiment is leveling off due to slowing exports and weakening factory output amid worries of a global trade war,” said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute.
Distant_Evaluation	“Still, the level of sentiment is high.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	I don’t think it will keep deteriorating either, given improving profits and rising prices.”
Cause_General	The headline index for big manufacturers’ confidence fell to plus 19 in September from plus 21 three months ago, the BOJ’s tankan survey showed, deteriorating for three straight quarters and lower than a median market forecast for plus 22.
Cause_General	The index for non-manufacturers fell to plus 22 from plus 24 in the June survey, matching a median market forecast and worsening for the first time in eight quarters.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Both big manufacturers and non-manufacturers expect business conditions to remain unchanged three months ahead, the survey showed.
Cause_General	Investors took the deterioration in the tankan business mood in their stride, pushing Japan's Nikkei share average .N225 to a 27-year high on Monday, as an extended weakening in yen helped improve export earnings prospects for Japanese corporations.
Distant_Evaluation	SOLID CAPEX
Distant_Evaluation	Despite the somewhat subdued business mood, the latest tankan underscored solid corporate capex plans, driven by demand for refurbishing capacity and boosting investment in robotics and automation to cope with labor shortages in the aging population.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Big companies plan to increase capital expenditure by 13.4 percent in the current fiscal year ending in March 2019, compared with 13.6 percent in the previous tankan survey.
Cause_General	Capital expenditure plans at all firms grew 8.5 percent in this fiscal year, close to the pace seen during Japan’s bubble economy era, Minami said.
Distant_Evaluation	“There’s room for further improvement given that small companies firm up earnings estimates from now on, although that will depend much on how effects of a trade war play out in business sentiment,” he said.
Cause_General	In an encouraging sign for Japan’s battle with deflation, the survey showed companies became more able to pass on costs, with the index measuring change in output prices at plus 7 for big manufacturers, the highest in a decade.
Cause_General	Underscoring the tightening labor market, the survey’s index measuring employment conditions at big firms hit minus 23, meaning the tightest level since 1992.
Cause_General	Japan’s economy rebounded in the second quarter from a contraction in January to March thanks to robust business spending.
Distant_Evaluation	But a summer of escalating trade frictions and natural disasters that disrupted supply chains cloud the outlook for the export-reliant economy.

Main	"BEIJING, Jan. 21 (Xinhua) -- Washington loves to brand itself as a ""shining city on the hill"", yet the latest government shutdown in the heart of Western democracy has once again exposed its chronic flaws."
Cause_Specific	The shutdown, the fourth in the past 25 years, is another product of the political battle between the Republicans and Democrats.
Distant_Evaluation	What's so ironic is that it came on the first anniversary of Donald Trump's presidency on Saturday, a slap in the face for the leadership in Washington.
Distant_Evaluation	With the election of Trump and the continued control of both houses of Congress by Republicans, the GOP seemed to have finally got revenge for eight years of a Democratic White House.
Distant_Evaluation	Their most recent victory was the highly controversial tax reform package introducing tax cuts that critics claimed would make the rich richer.
Cause_General	The Trump administration has backtracked on almost every notable policy Trump's predecessor Barack Obama had put in place, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and the Paris climate accord.
Distant_Evaluation	If there was any legacy that has survived the transfer of power, it was the spirit of noncooperation across party lines.
Distant_Historical	The U.S. federal government was shut down when the Obama administration and the Republicans in Congress were locked in a battle on Obama's healthcare plan in 2013.
Distant_Evaluation	Now that another lockdown is underway again, the two major political parties are as usual busy accusing each other of not doing their job.
Distant_Evaluation	Thanks to their unrelenting rivalry, many of America's long-standing problems remain unresolved.
Distant_Historical	Last year, gun crimes became more rampant,the wealth gap continued to widen, and the politics grew unprecedentedly polarized.
Distant_Evaluation	The Western democratic system is hailed by the developed world as near perfect and the most superior political system to run a country.
Distant_Evaluation	However, what's happening in the United States today will make more people worldwide reflect on the viability and legitimacy of such a chaotic political system.
Distant_Evaluation	After all, for most people, the most important criterion for an effective political system is how it helps to resolve their problems, not telling them whom to blame.

Main	SEOUL, Jan. 4 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign reserves rose for 10 straight years through 2018, doubling the 2008 figure when the global financial crisis hit the economy, central bank data showed Friday.
Cause_General	The foreign reserves hit a new monthly high of 403.69 billion U.S. dollars as of end-December, up 0.71 billion dollars from a month earlier, according to the Bank of Korea.
Main	For the entire year of 2018, the foreign currency reserves grew 14.42 billion dollars, keeping an upward momentum for the 10th consecutive year.
Distant_Historical	It more than doubled the 201.2 billion dollars tailed in 2008.
Cause_General	As of end-December, the country's foreign reserves were composed of 379.6 billion dollars of securities, 3.35 billion dollars of deposits, 4.79 billion dollars of gold bullion, 3.43 billion dollars of special drawing rights and 2.14 billion dollars of IMF positions.
Cause_General	South Korea was the world's eighth-largest holder of foreign reserves as of November.
Main	The new Democratic leaders of the Senate and the House warned President Bush on Friday against sending additional troops to Iraq, setting the stage for what could become a major confrontation over a new war strategy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Bush is expected to call for more troops in a speech as soon as Wednesday, as part of a renewed effort to secure Baghdad.
Main	But Nancy Pelosi, the new speaker of the House, and Harry Reid, the new Senate majority leader, dismissed that approach as a strategy ''that has already failed.''
Main	''Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain,'' Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Reid wrote in a letter to Mr. Bush.
Main	''We are well past the point of more troops for Iraq,'' they added, urging Mr. Bush to begin a ''phased redeployment,'' or gradual withdrawal.
Distant_Evaluation	Not all Democrats agree with the position their leaders staked out in the letter on Friday, just days before Mr. Bush is expected to announce a broad strategy involving more troops, accelerated training of Iraqi forces and a large increase in economic and reconstruction aid to Iraq.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But the release of the letter suggests that a major political battle may be brewing.
Cause_General	Mr. Bush appeared to be trying to head off any confrontation when he invited 13 Democratic and Republican senators to the White House Friday for what administration officials called a ''consultation'' on Iraq.
Cause_General	At a later meeting, Mr. Bush met with the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, who cautioned that Congress would want to take time to consider the strategy before Mr. Bush began implementing it.
Distant_Evaluation	''The president has had this opportunity now for some weeks, and I think Congress is entitled to an opportunity to independently look at the situation,'' Mr. Warner said.
Cause_General	Mr. Bush has begun to put parts of his plan in place, making official on Friday some changes that will insure new faces are associated with a new approach.
Cause_General	He announced the nomination of Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus as the new commander in Iraq, to succeed Gen. George W. Casey Jr., whom Mr. Bush said he intended to elevate to Army chief of staff.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Bush praised General Casey, who spent much of 2006 pressing for a gradual withdrawal of troops, as ''strong and effective''; he hailed General Petraeus, who has reportedly backed an increase, as ''a soldier of vision and determination.''
Cause_General	Mr. Bush is also remaking his diplomatic team, nominating John D. Negroponte, the director of national intelligence, to be deputy secretary of state.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Ryan C. Crocker is expected to be nominated ambassador to Iraq.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	His nomination would for the first time place an Arabist with experience in sectarian conflicts, mostly in Lebanon, at the head of the embassy in Baghdad.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Administration and Congressional officials said they expected the military and diplomatic nominations to receive Senate approval, though senators might use the hearings to air dissent about any troop increase and draw attention to the perceived failings of Iraq strategy.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The bigger question is whether Congress will seek to stop the troop increase.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In theory, it could cut off financing, the only way it could actually interfere with the commander in chief's plans.
Distant_Evaluation	But Democrats have said they would not take such a step, largely out of fear of being accused of undercutting the troops.
Cause_General	That leaves them with only one option: holding a series of hearings, which start next week, immediately after the president's speech, that are intended to expose the divisions within the military over the wisdom of increasing troops.
Distant_Evaluation	Many senior officers, including General Casey, have argued that adding American troops will undercut the effort to get the Iraqi government to defend itself.
Distant_Evaluation	Some Republican leaders insisted that Congress should not go down that path.
Distant_Evaluation	''I don't think that we should be dictating military strategy in Iraq from Capitol Hill,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican minority leader in the House.
Cause_General	In addition to the 13 senators, Democrats and Republicans, invited to the White House on Friday afternoon, those attending the meeting included Vice President Dick Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, the Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Peter Pace, and Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser.
Cause_General	Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois, who both are considering a presidential candidacy, arrived at the White House at nearly the same time.
Cause_General	After the meeting, Mrs. Clinton did not issue a statement, while Mr. Obama spoke to reporters about his conversation with Mr. Bush.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''I personally indicated that an escalation of troop levels in Iraq was a mistake and that we need a political accommodation, rather than a military approach to the sectarian violence there,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''I think he recognizes that the status quo is unacceptable and has to change.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Senator Mary L. Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat, said she would consider supporting an increase in troops for a short time if the president could articulate ''specific opportunities for success,'' particularly cities that troops would be dispatched to and how long they would stay.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Ms. Landrieu also said she would need to be convinced that there was a broader solution to limit American involvement in Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	''The American people's patience is wearing thin with the vagueness,'' she said, speaking to reporters as she left the White House.
Distant_Evaluation	In interviews after the meeting, several senators said they could not tell whether Mr. Bush had made a decision whether to call for a troop increase.
Distant_Evaluation	The senators described the meeting as frank but not confrontational.
Distant_Evaluation	But even those who have supported the administration's Iraq policy said it was time for a change of course.
Distant_Evaluation	''I don't know that the American people will see the surge as a new direction,'' said Senator Ben Nelson, a Democrat from Nebraska.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''The American people want to see a change in direction, not just a change in slogans.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Senator Blanche Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat at the meeting, said an increase in troops would face considerable scrutiny in Congress from Democrats and Republicans.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''I asked the president, 'Where would that surge come from?'
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	'' Ms. Lincoln said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''He said that was a very good question.''

Main	Tucked away in rural North Carolina, tiny Tryon, with a population of 1,700, will be at the center of the equestrian universe from Sept. 11 to 23 and in the projected path of Florence, the most powerful storm to menace the Carolinas in nearly three decades.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Staged once every four years, an estimated 500,000 spectators are expected to take in the action in nine disciplines, including the Olympic events of show jumping, eventing and dressage, making it the highest-attended sporting event in the United States this year according to WEG projections.
Cause_General	After Tuesday’s opening ceremonies, competition is scheduled to get underway on Wednesday while at the same time more than a million people along the U.S. southeast coast will be fleeing the Category 4 storm and winds of 130 miles per hour (210 kph).
Main	Florence is expected to make landfall on Friday, most likely in southeastern North Carolina near the South Carolina border or about 250 miles (400km) from Tryon.
Main	The WEG could avoid most of the ferocious winds, but forecasters have warned the storm could linger for days and could result in 20 to 30 inches (51 cm to 76 cm) of rain falling in places, posing the risk of deadly flooding miles inland.
Cause_General	The National Weather Service, which has an office on site at the WEG, is closely monitoring the situation and advising organizers.
Distant_Evaluation	“We are proactively preparing for the possible severe weather the storm system may bring to this area and have both strategic and emergency plans in place for both the people and horses on-site,” said the WEG in a statement.
Distant_Evaluation	“There are numerous multi-floored buildings at the venue and our permanent stabling is incredibly secure and safe.
Distant_Evaluation	In the case of severe weather which requires immediate response, we have a robust evacuation protocol.”
Distant_Evaluation	Any major disruptions to the WEG would also be a significant blow to the local economy which is expecting an injection of $400 million into a region still dealing with the fallout from the last recession and a disappearing textile industry.
Distant_Evaluation	ACCELERATE GROWTH
Distant_Evaluation	For entrepreneur Mark Bellissimo, who along with his partners have invested close to $200 million into developing the Tryon International Equestrian Center (TIEC), the WEG was designed to be a springboard that would turn the facility into a year-round horse lifestyle destination.
Distant_Evaluation	“At the end of the day it (WEG) was an opportunity to breath life into this place quickly,” Bellissimo told Reuters.
Distant_Evaluation	“People say you’re doing an awful lot for the WEG, we are not doing it for WEG.
Distant_Evaluation	“WEG is a great opportunity to create an engine that will accelerate the growth long term.”
Cause_General	A 1,600 acre facility rolling out under the gaze of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the TIEC underwent a massive rebuild for the WEG that included the construction of a 20,000-seat main stadium and an adjoining arena with seating for 8,000.
Cause_General	The original property had featured an Arnold Palmer designed golf course that is now a cross-country course designed by British Olympic gold medalist Mark Phillips, where bunkers and tee boxes can still be spotted.
Cause_General	The facility also includes seven permanent barns and 1,200 stalls that will be home for most of the world’s elite show horses.
Cause_General	It will be first class treatment for the four-legged stars of the show, with 550 horses arriving on a specially designed Boeing 777 freighter aircraft in customized stalls.
Distant_Evaluation	Organizers said it was the largest commercial airlift of horses ever undertaken.

Main	Prime Minister Ehud Olmert met President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt on Thursday evening in an effort to give momentum to the Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations.
Cause_General	But the meeting was overshadowed by an Israeli raid in the West Bank in which four Palestinians were killed and 20 wounded.
Cause_General	Mr. Mubarak was clearly embarrassed by the timing of the raid, hours before the meeting of the two leaders in an Egyptian Red Sea resort town, Sharm el Sheik.
Main	He called it a hindrance to peace efforts and told Mr. Olmert that Egypt ''rejects and is indignant at the military operation.''
Main	''Israel's security cannot be achieved through military force but by serious endeavors toward peace,'' Mr. Mubarak added at his news conference with Mr. Olmert.
Main	Mr. Olmert said that he was sorry that innocent Palestinians were hurt, but that Israel would defend itself and was acting to arrest ''terrorists who had killed Israelis.''
Main	He gave no explanation for the timing of the daylight raid, a vain attempt to arrest a wanted militant, which used unusual force in normally quiet Ramallah.
Main	He said Israeli troops returned fire, but did not initiate it.
Main	''Things developed in a way that could not have been predicted in advance,'' he said.
Main	''If innocent people were hurt, this was not our intention.''
Distant_Evaluation	The Palestinian Authority president, Mahmoud Abbas, with whom Mr. Olmert met last week, condemned the raid, saying in a statement that it ''proved that the Israeli calls for peace and security are fake.''
Cause_General	Palestinians have been calling for an extension of a Gaza truce with Israel to the West Bank.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''The continued aggression will only lead to the destruction of all efforts aimed at realizing peace,'' Mr. Abbas said.
Main	Mr. Olmert and Mr. Mubarak said Egypt was continuing its efforts to secure the release of an Israeli corporal captured in June by militants, offering in exchange several hundred Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There had been speculation that the two men might be able to announce more concrete progress on the matter, which is blocking more substantive discussions with Mr. Abbas.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Egyptian officials said that they were discussing another Olmert-Abbas meeting with Egyptian and Jordanian leaders present.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is to visit the region this month.
Cause_General	It was an unusual and emotional day for Mr. Olmert, during which he commemorated two legendary Israeli political figures, both of whom he succeeded in their jobs.
Cause_General	Earlier, in Jerusalem, he spoke at the state funeral for the city's fabled former mayor, Teddy Kollek, who died Tuesday at 95 and was buried in the area of the Mount Herzl cemetery reserved for Israel's leaders.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Olmert defeated Mr. Kollek to become Jerusalem's mayor in a bitter political fight in 1993.
Distant_Historical	He said Israel's first leader, David Ben-Gurion, had declared Jerusalem to be Israel's capital in 1949, but ''Teddy Kollek made it so.''
Cause_General	Thursday also marked a year since Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suffered a second extensive stroke, which left him in a deep coma from which he is not expected to awaken.
Cause_General	Mr. Olmert, Mr. Sharon's deputy, was chosen to lead the Kadima Party in his stead and became prime minister, and he acknowledged Mr. Sharon's tragedy at his news conference in Egypt.
Distant_Evaluation	In general, Mr. Olmert has been regarded as inferior to Mr. Sharon and Mr. Kollek.
Cause_General	In the latest opinion poll, conducted by the Dahaf Institute and reported Thursday in the newspaper Yediot Aharanot, nearly 70 percent of Israelis polled said they disapproved of Mr. Olmert's performance as prime minister.
Distant_Evaluation	Israelis are unhappy with the way he managed the summer's war against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and do not much like his personality, contrasting him with the more stolid and experienced Mr. Sharon.
Cause_General	Still, Mr. Olmert has proved himself a skilled politician, and early on Thursday Parliament quietly passed his $68 billion budget, a crucial test of his government's ability to survive.
Distant_Evaluation	The budget battle was always a great drama under Mr. Sharon, but Mr. Olmert, who has expanded his governing coalition to include parties ranging from Labor to the right-wing Israel Beiteinu Party of Avigdor Lieberman, had little difficulty.
Cause_General	Mr. Olmert's office is being rocked, though, by a new corruption scandal.
Cause_General	He has not been touched by this scandal, though he has been under investigation for smaller cases of improper use of influence.
Cause_General	But his longtime office director, Shula Zaken, has been put under house arrest and ordered not to contact Mr. Olmert as the police investigate whether she and the director of the Tax Authority, Jackie Matza, tried to help Ms. Zaken's brother and two other businesspeople through the appointment of cronies to key jobs in return for tax breaks.
Cause_General	About 30 people are under some form of detention in the spreading scandal.
Cause_General	The operation in Ramallah by Israeli forces, with armored vehicles, bulldozers and helicopter support, was carried out hours before Mr. Olmert met with Mr. Mubarak.
Cause_General	Palestinians and news reports said the operation was to arrest Rabiah Hamad of Fatah, a senior member of Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades.
Cause_General	The army would not confirm that Mr. Hamad was the target, but said the man it wanted was armed and was wounded, but escaped.
Cause_General	The army arrested four other wanted Palestinians, a spokesman said.
Distant_Evaluation	It was a rare incursion into the heart of Ramallah, and it prompted an angry response.
Cause_General	Youths on rooftops threw stones, metal trash barrels, a refrigerator and blocks of concrete at the Israeli Army vehicles.
Cause_General	There were mortars fired at the Israeli soldiers, and an exchange of gunfire.
Cause_General	Palestinian medics said four men -- Yussef Abdel Khader, 23; Khalil al-Badawi, 20; Jamal Jawela, 29; and Ala al-Himran, in his 20s -- died at a Ramallah hospital from gunshot wounds.
Cause_General	In Gaza there was continuing violence, with three more men killed in fighting between Fatah and Hamas.
Cause_General	The fighting centered around the Jabaliya refugee camp in northern Gaza after gunmen surrounded the houses of known political or security figures.
Cause_General	In Beit Lahiya, a senior Fatah commander, Col. Muhammad Gharib, was killed and his wife severely wounded when Hamas militants attacked his home with rifle fire and rocket-propelled grenades.
Cause_General	Two of his bodyguards were also killed.
Cause_General	About 25 others were wounded in Jabaliya, and local radio was filled with appeals to the gunmen to restore calm.
Cause_General	On Wednesday five Palestinians, including a woman who was a passer-by, were killed and 12 wounded in Fatah-Hamas gun battles, which broke a weeklong lull.
Cause_General	Other militant factions arranged a truce overnight and kidnapped members of Hamas and Fatah were released by the other sides, but the truce broke down on Thursday.
Cause_General	The Palestinian prime minister, Ismail Haniya, returned to Gaza on Thursday from hajj, his pilgrimage to Mecca, Saudi Arabia.
Cause_General	His entourage underwent a special inspection in El Arish, Egypt, to ensure that he was not carrying large amounts of cash back to Gaza, which has been deprived of most Western aid since Hamas won parliamentary elections last January.
Cause_General	[Early Friday, Mr. Haniya said he and Mr. Abbas had agreed at emergency talks to keep gunmen from their parties off Gaza's streets.]
Cause_General	For the fourth day there was no word about a kidnapped Peruvian photographer for Agence France-Presse, Jaime Rázuri, 50, who is said by colleagues to be lacking a required heart medication.
Distant_Evaluation	Palestinian security services have warned foreign journalists to keep out of Gaza for now, because of the kidnappings and chaos.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A leader of the Palestinian People's Party, Bassam al-Salhi, said the security chaos could be resolved only with political agreement.
Distant_Evaluation	''The weakness of the Palestinian political system and the situation of the current Hamas-led government have contributed to this state of lawlessness,'' he said.
Main	LONDON (Reuters) - The British government would not object to Washington seeking the death penalty for two British Islamic State militants if they are extradited to the United States, a Home Office minister said on Monday.

Main	Security minister Ben Wallace said Britain was prepared to waive its long-standing objection to executions in the case of captured fighters, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh.
Cause_General	The men are suspected of being two of four militants, dubbed “The Beatles” because of their English accents, who took part in the kidnap, torture and murder of Western hostages.
Main	“In this instance, and after carefully considered advice, the government took the rare decision not to require assurances in this case,” Wallace told the lower house of Parliament.
Cause_Specific	His statement followed a leaked letter published in the Daily Telegraph from British Home Secretary Sajid Javid.
Cause_General	The two suspects were captured in Syria in January by a U.S.-backed Syrian force, and Britain and the United States have been in discussions about how and where they should face justice.
Distant_Evaluation	According to the Telegraph, Javid wrote to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions saying Britain was not intending to request that the two men be sent to the United Kingdom, saying a successful prosecution in the United States was more likely.
Distant_Evaluation	Furthermore, he said Britain would not insist on guarantees the men would not be executed.
Distant_Evaluation	“I am of the view that there are strong reasons for not requiring a death penalty assurance in this specific case, so no such assurances will be sought,” the letter said.
Distant_Evaluation	“As you are aware, it is the long held position of the UK to seek death penalty assurances, and our decision in this case does not reflect a change in our policy on assistance in U.S. death penalty cases generally, nor the UK Government’s stance on the global abolition of the death penalty.”
Distant_Evaluation	Earlier on Monday Prime Minister Theresa May’s spokeswoman said Britain wanted the militants to be tried in the most appropriate jurisdiction.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“HAUNT THE GOVERNMENT”
Distant_Evaluation	The opposition Labour Party accused Javid of “secretly and unilaterally” abandoning Britain’s opposition to the death penalty.
Distant_Evaluation	“By doing so he is not just playing with the lives of these particular terrorists but those of other Britons - including potentially innocent ones - all over the world,” said Labour’s Shami Chakrabarti.
Cause_General	The government’s stance also drew criticism from its own party.
Distant_Evaluation	Conservative lawmaker Dominic Grieve asked if there was a precedent for the government deviating from its normal policy and why it had not asked for an assurance from the U.S..
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“Those are the two key questions and until they are answered I have to say ... this issue is going to continue to haunt the government,” he said.
Distant_Historical	The most notorious of the four so called “Beatles” was Mohammed Emwazi, known as “Jihadi John”, who is believed to have been killed in a U.S.-British missile strike in 2015.

Main	Hawaii prison officials said Tuesday that all of the state's 168 female inmates at a privately run Kentucky prison will be removed by the end of September because of charges of sexual abuse by guards.
Main_Consequence	Forty inmates were returned to Hawaii on Aug. 17.
Cause_Specific	This month, officials from the Hawaii Department of Public Safety traveled to Kentucky to investigate accusations that inmates at the prison, the Otter Creek Correctional Center in Wheelwright, including seven from Hawaii, had been sexually assaulted by the prison staff.
Cause_General	Otter Creek is run by the Corrections Corporation of America and is one of a spate of private, for-profit prisons, mainly in the South, that have been the focus of investigations over issues like abusive conditions and wrongful deaths.
Distant_Evaluation	Because eastern Kentucky is one of the poorest rural regions in the country, the prison was welcomed by local residents desperate for jobs.
Distant_Evaluation	Hawaii sent inmates to Kentucky to save money.
Cause_General	Housing an inmate at the Women's Community Correctional Center in Kailua, Hawaii, costs $86 a day, compared with $58.46 a day at the Kentucky prison, not including air travel.
Cause_General	Hawaii investigators found that at least five corrections officials at the prison, including a chaplain, had been charged with having sex with inmates in the last three years, and four were convicted.
Cause_General	Three rape cases involving guards and Hawaii inmates were recently turned over to law enforcement authorities.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Kentucky State Police said another sexual assault case would go to a grand jury soon.
Cause_General	Kentucky is one of only three states -- the others are Iowa and Maryland -- where it is a misdemeanor rather than a felony for a prison guard to have sex with an inmate, according to the National Institute of Corrections, a policy arm of the Justice Department.
Cause_General	A bill to increase the penalties for such sexual misconduct failed to pass in the Kentucky legislature this year.
Distant_Evaluation	The private prison industry has generated extensive controversy, with critics arguing that incarceration should not be contracted to for-profit companies.
Cause_General	Several reports have found contract violations at private prisons, safety and security concerns, questionable cost savings and higher rates of inmate recidivism.
Distant_Evaluation	"""Privately operated prisons appear to have systemic problems in maintaining secure facilities,"" a 2001 study by the Federal Bureau of Prisons concluded."
Distant_Evaluation	Proponents say privately run prisons provide needed beds at lower cost.
Cause_General	About 8 percent of state and federal inmates are held in such prisons, according to the Justice Department.
Main	President Bush's new Iraq policy will establish a series of goals that the Iraqi government will be expected to meet to try to ease sectarian tensions and stabilize the country politically and economically, senior administration officials said Sunday.
Main	Among these ''benchmarks'' are steps that would draw more Sunnis into the political process, finalize a long-delayed measure on the distribution of oil revenue and ease the government's policy toward former Baath Party members, the officials said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	As the policy is being debated in Washington, the new American operational commander in Iraq said Sunday that his plan was to send additional American troops, expected to be part of the policy change, into Baghdad's toughest neighborhoods, and that under the new strategy it may take another ''two or three years'' to gain the upper hand in the war.
Error	[Page A9.]
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Without saying what the specific penalties for failing to achieve the goals would be, American officials insisted that they intended to hold the Iraqis to a realistic timetable for action, but the Americans and Iraqis have agreed on many of the objectives before, only to fall considerably short.
Cause_General	And the widespread skepticism about the Bush administration's Iraq strategy among Democrats and some Republicans was underscored by the new speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, in a television interview broadcast Sunday.
Distant_Evaluation	She, along with the Democratic leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, informed the president that they were opposed to increasing troop levels.
Distant_Evaluation	''If the president wants to add to this mission, he is going to have to justify it,'' Mrs. Pelosi said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation.''
Distant_Evaluation	''And this is new for him because up until now the Republican Congress has given him a blank check with no oversight, no standards, no conditions.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	She also suggested that Congress should deal with financing for the current war and for the proposed increase as separate issues.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''If the president chooses to escalate the war, in his budget request we want to see a distinction between what is there to support the troops who are there now,'' she said.
Cause_General	Whether lawmakers are prepared to advocate legislative steps to withhold funds from an expanded mission is unclear.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Sunday that as a practical matter, there was little that lawmakers could do to prevent Mr. Bush from expanding the American military mission in Iraq.
Distant_Evaluation	''You can't go in like a Tinkertoy and play around and say you can't spend the money on this piece and this piece,'' Mr. Biden said on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''He'll be able to keep the troops there forever, constitutionally, if he wants to.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''As a practical matter,'' Mr. Biden added, ''there is no way to say, 'Mr.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	President, stop.'
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Bush is expected to refer to the benchmarks in a much-anticipated speech this week outlining his new Iraq strategy, including plans to send as many as 20,000 additional troops.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Administration officials plan to make the benchmarks public sometime after the address.
Distant_Evaluation	In addition to trying to ease Congressional concerns over the new strategy, the administration is trying to instill discipline in an Iraqi government that has been slow to act and hampered by sectarian agendas.
Distant_Evaluation	''There will be an approach and a strategy that reflects not only the desire for the Iraqis to take more responsibility but the need for the Iraqis to step up,'' a senior administration official familiar with the deliberations said.
Distant_Evaluation	''This is not an open-ended commitment.
Distant_Evaluation	We are putting real specific requirements and expectations on the Iraqi government.''
Distant_Historical	The Americans and Iraqis have agreed on benchmarks before.
Distant_Historical	Indeed, some of the goals that are to be incorporated on the list of benchmarks have been carried over from an earlier list that was hammered out with the Iraqis and made public in October, but never met.
Main	The benchmarks, for example, include a previously stated commitment: setting a date for provincial elections.
Cause_General	That goal is intended to enfranchise Sunnis -- who had initially boycotted the political process -- and thus give them a role in the governing of Sunni-dominated areas.
Main	Another measure that was carried over from the old list of benchmarks is the final completion of the long-delayed national oil law that would give the central government the power to distribute current and future oil revenues to the provinces or regions, based on their population.
Main	The list of benchmarks will also deal with the still-unresolved matter of settling a new policy on de-Baathification.
Distant_Evaluation	There is wide agreement among experts that the initial Iraqi approach toward former Baath Party members was too sweeping and excluded too many from government service and entitlements.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A revised approach would seek to address those concerns by, for example, paying Army pensions to some former Baathists who have been excluded from receiving them.
Cause_General	One important theme of the new Iraqi strategy will be encouraging the Iraqi government to spend more on projects and programs in Sunni areas.
Cause_General	Most of the funds allocated for the Sunni-dominated Anbar Province in western Iraq have never actually been expended.
Cause_General	That has encouraged opposition to the Iraqi authorities in Baghdad and handicapped the American military's counterinsurgency efforts in the province.
Distant_Evaluation	''The assessment has been that the disbursement of funds from the Iraqi government from Baghdad out to the provinces, particularly the Sunni provinces, has been either slow or nonexisting,'' the senior Bush administration official said.
Distant_Evaluation	''That has to change.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Administration officials said that by more clearly defining the goals and by planning to make them public some time after Mr. Bush's address they hoped to encourage a sense of accountability on the part of the Iraqis.
Cause_General	Mr. Bush discussed some of the goals -- the need for provincial elections, the enactment of the oil law and reform of Iraq's de-Baathification policy -- during his recent video conference with Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki.
Distant_Evaluation	The Americans have not been the only ones underscoring the need for benchmarks.
Cause_General	The Maliki government has pressed to gain direct command of Iraq's 10 army divisions, insisting it should be achieved by June.
Distant_Evaluation	Some American officials have been concerned that it is overambitious.
Cause_General	Nevertheless, an administration official has indicated that it is among the goals.
Distant_Evaluation	In Washington, the idea of benchmarks has been generally welcomed by lawmakers, though many remain skeptical that they will be achieved on schedule.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	After meeting with the president and his national security team on Friday at the White House, senators from both parties said they told Mr. Bush they would have trouble supporting an American troop increase unless the plan included specific goals for the Iraqi government.
Distant_Evaluation	Senator John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, said one of his Senate colleagues asked why the effort to add to American forces in Iraq would be more likely to succeed than previous troop increases.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Sununu said the president and Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, responded that Mr. Bush's plan would ''include more specific goals, different rules of engagement and different expectations for cooperation with the Iraqi government.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Sununu said when he raised questions about oil revenue distribution, provincial elections and national reconciliation, he received ''strong assurances that these were recognized as critical issues, that they were being addressed by the Maliki government,'' with one proposal that was nearing completion for the distribution of oil revenue and another regarding provincial elections.

Main	BEIJING, Dec. 31 (Xinhua) -- China's economy has defied doom-mongers again in 2018, and economists believe there are good reasons to remain confident about its outlook.
Distant_Evaluation	Although latest economic indicators revealed signs of stress, as industrial profits posted their first drop in three years and consumption growth missed expectations in November, merely focusing on short-term fluctuations will miss the big picture of the economy.
Distant_Evaluation	China's tone-setting economic meeting described problems facing the economy as part of development, noting that the country is still and will be in an important period of strategic opportunity for development for a long time to come.
Distant_Evaluation	SOUND FUNDAMENTALS
Distant_Evaluation	Despite downward pressure from the Sino-U.S. trade frictions, a rebalancing and deleveraging domestic economy and monetary tightening in certain developed economies, China has maintained stable economic growth, offering certainties to a world mired in uncertainties.
Cause_General	Its GDP rose 6.7 percent in the first three quarters of 2018, putting the economy on track to meet the government's targeted growth of around 6.5 percent set for 2018.
Distant_Evaluation	Niu Li, an economist with the State Information Center, a government think tank, said the economy is highly likely to rise 6.6 percent this year.
Distant_Evaluation	This means China remains a top performer in the global economic arena, with the IMF forecasting growth of 2.4 percent for advanced economies this year.
Distant_Evaluation	The Sino-U.S. trade frictions have been properly dealt with.
Cause_General	Employment remains stable, consumer inflation is kept at a mild level, resident income continues to grow steadily, while development is more balanced and sustainable with higher quality.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Consumption is set to contribute 78.2 percent of China's economic growth this year, the highest level since 2001, according to a report released by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences this month.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""We expect consumption to remain the largest driver of the economy in the next decade,"" said Ding Shuang, an economist of the Standard Chartered Bank, citing great potential consumption to continue to grow faster than investment amid the ongoing trends of urbanization, aging and a rising middle-income group that demands quality goods and services."
Cause_General	While consumer spending contributed a bigger share of GDP growth, technology and innovation are picking up the slack as certain traditional industries took a hit.
Distant_Evaluation	High-tech manufacturing and equipment production sectors maintained fast expansion.
Cause_General	In the Global Innovation Index 2018 by the World Intellectual Property Organization, China became the first middle-income economy on the list of the world's 20 most innovative economies this year.
Distant_Evaluation	The medium-high level of growth achieved during the past year exhibited the vitality and resilience of the Chinese economy, which will ensure its future stability, said Liu Qiao, head of the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University.
Distant_Evaluation	ENOUGH AMMUNITION
Distant_Evaluation	Another reason for the optimism is that the Chinese policymakers have many economic levers at hand to deal with challenges, analysts said.
Cause_General	The government's options include supply-side structural reform, credit policy, and fiscal firepower.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	On the monetary policy front, economists said broad-based easing is not immediately on the cards, but the central bank may tweak policies to keep funding flowing to the backbone of the economy without funneling credit to companies that are already highly indebted.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Standard Chartered Bank said the People's Bank of China might cut the reserve requirement ratio by 200 basis points by the end of 2019 to prevent a tightening of monetary and credit conditions and reduce funding costs for the real economy by providing banks with long-term liquidity at a relatively low cost.
Distant_Evaluation	China's stable economic growth enables a more proactive fiscal policy through deeper tax and fee cuts as well as accelerating government spending.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	UBS economist Wang Tao expected the fiscal budget deficit to rise to 3 percent of GDP in 2019 from 2.6 percent in 2018, and tax cuts to exceed one percent of GDP, mainly in value-added tax, corporate income tax, and individual income tax, together with a reduction in corporate social insurance contribution.
Cause_General	To boost government spending, the country's legislature has adopted a decision to speed up local government bond issuance before the approval of the annual fiscal budget.
Cause_General	Between Jan. 1, 2019 and Dec. 31, 2022, the State Council will be authorized to assign part of the newly-added quotas for local government bonds each year before the annual budget approval.
Distant_Evaluation	Yang Weimin, deputy director of the economic committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, said the country should also further supply-side structural reform to fix the mismatch in resource allocation to enhance economic resilience.
Distant_Evaluation	Previous structural adjustments should be reinforced, with continued efforts to downsize glutted industries, reduce all types of business burdens and channel more energy into weak areas including infrastructure, according to the annual Central Economic Work Conference.
Distant_Evaluation	FASTER REFORM, WIDER OPENING-UP
Cause_General	This year marked the 40th anniversary of its reform and opening-up, which China commemorated with concrete moves to overhaul and reform its economy.
Cause_General	The country has broadened market access, reduced import duties, built new ground in opening up and provided new platforms for win-win cooperation with the rest of the world.
Cause_General	Foreign ownership restrictions in the financial and auto sectors have been eased, with some ownership caps to be removed completely in the coming three years; tariffs were cut for an array of imported products including cars, consumer products, and industrial goods; and more import duty cuts will come into effect next year.
Distant_Evaluation	Reform and opening-up has gained pace.
Cause_General	In its latest step, China announced on Dec. 25 a negative list for market access that is shorter and applies to all market players, allowing them to equally enter sectors that are not on the list.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The government will continue to widen market access for foreign investors while the negative list is expected to be further shortened in 2019, said Tang Wenhong, head of foreign investment management department under the Ministry of Commerce.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	In the coming year, the country also vowed to push forward with reforms in various fields including state-owned enterprises, taxation and financing, land, market access as well as social management.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	To promote foreign trade, China will expand exports and imports and promote the diversification of export markets.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It will continue to advance the Belt and Road Initiative, actively participate in WTO reforms, and promote trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, according to CICC economist Liu Liu.
Distant_Evaluation	The past four decades have seen China's metamorphosis from an impoverished backwater into a major contributor to the world's economy, and analysts expected the fresh push to unleash a new wave of development dividends.

Cause_Specific	The All India Online Vendors Association (AIOVA) on Friday filed a petition with the Competition Commission of India (CCI) alleging that the online retailer favors merchants that it partly owns, such as Cloudtail and Appario.
Main	The company said on Monday that all sellers on its platform are treated equally.
Main	“Amazon has an equal relationship with all the sellers on our marketplace,” Amazon India spokeswoman Bhumika Shah said in an email, adding that the company is “absolutely committed” to compliance with local laws.
Cause_General	AIOVA, which represents more than 3,500 online sellers, said that large sellers such as Cloudtail and Appario were being charged significantly less than Amazon’s advertised rates.
Cause_General	Cloudtail is owned by Prione Business Services, which is a joint venture between Amazon and Infosys co-founder N.R Narayana Murthy’s Catamaran Ventures.
Cause_General	Appario is a joint venture between Amazon and Patni group.
Distant_Evaluation	“There should not be any preferential treatment,” AIOVA’s lawyer, Chanakya Basa, said on Monday.
Cause_General	India has a burgeoning e-commerce market, with almost 500 million Indians using the Internet in 2018 and the e-commerce market is tipped to grow to $200 billion in a decade, according to Morgan Stanley.
Cause_General	AIOVA has asked the antitrust regulator to impose a “severe penalty” for unfair practices and to restrict what it says are “preferred sellers” from participating in Amazon India’s annual festival sales, which start this week.
Distant_Historical	The lobby group filed a similar petition against Walmart-owned Flipkart in May, alleging violation of competition rules through preferential treatment for select sellers.
Cause_General	AIOVA also asked for restrictions to be placed on Flipkart’s festival sale this week.
Cause_General	Flipkart did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Cause_General	Amazon has scheduled its Great Indian Festival sale over Oct. 10-15 and Flipkart’s Big Billion Days sale is scheduled for Oct. 10-14, according to their websites.
Main	(Reuters) - Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority has banned former Deutsche Bank trader Christian Bittar from performing any function related to any regulated financial activity, the financial watchdog said on Friday.

Cause_Specific	Christian Bittar, 46, was sentenced to five years and four months in March after pleading guilty for plotting to rig global Euribor interest rates.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“If he had not been convicted and imprisoned for the same matters, the FCA would have sought a financial penalty of 6.5 million pounds ($8.50 million),” said Mark Steward, director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA.
Main	“As it is, we have prohibited him from performing any regulated function, reinforcing the message of the criminal court,” Steward said.
Cause_General	Apart from Bittar, former Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef was also sentenced to eight years for the same crime.
Cause_Specific	The two men were charged with conspiring to manipulate the Euro interbank offered rate (Euribor), which helps determine rates on more than $150 trillion of financial contracts and loans worldwide, between January 2005 and December 2009.
Distant_Historical	“Between March 2005 and June 2009, Bittar made at least 81 requests to Deutsche Bank submitters for high or low EURIBOR submissions to benefit trading positions,” Steward said.
Distant_Historical	Barclays was the first of 11 major banks and brokerages to be fined in 2012 in a global investigation into allegations of rate-rigging.
Distant_Historical	Its $453 million penalty sparked a backlash that forced out former CEO Bob Diamond, an overhaul of rate-setting rules and the British criminal inquiry.

Cause_General	JAKARTA, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian annual inflation accelerated at a slower pace in December, within the target range of the central bank in November.
Cause_General	The national statistics bureau announced on Wednesday that consumer price index touched a 3.13 percent in December year-over-year, compared with a 3.23 percent annual inflation in November.
Distant_Evaluation	The price hike of non-subsidized fuel contributed the most to the acceleration of prices last year, head of the bureau Kecuk Suhariyanto said.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The commodity contributed, the highest, to the price hike was gasoline fuel which is not subsidized,"" he added."
Distant_Historical	The Indonesian government rose prices of several types of non-subsidized fuel on July 1, 2018.
Cause_General	The annualized core inflation, stripping off government-controlled and volatile food prices, ticked up to 3.07 percent in December from 3.03 percent in November, the official said.
Cause_General	Indonesia's central bank, Bank Indonesia, has extended tightening cycle by edging up its interest rate of 175 basis points to 6 percent since May 17 to shore up rupiah value against the greenback.
Distant_Historical	The central bank targeted inflation at the range of 2.5 to 4.5 percent last year.

Main	STOCKHOLM, Sept. 10 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish elections have ended in a nearly deadlock between the left and right political blocs, leaving the nationalist Sweden Democrats in a kingmaker position, preliminary votes counting showed on Monday.
Cause_General	The final tally is not expected until the end of the week when early votes and overseas ballots are counted.
Main	But results from all of Sweden's 6,004 districts showed on Monday that the center-left and center-right blocs had roughly 40 percent each of the vote, meaning neither garnered a majority.
Cause_General	Prime Minister Stefan Lofven's left bloc holds just a one-seat lead over the opposition Alliance.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This evening ought to be the funeral for bloc politics,"" Lofven said in his Election Night speech, defying demands from the Alliance for his resignation and calling instead for collaboration across the political divide."
Cause_General	But on Monday, the opposition leader, Ulf Kristersson of the Moderate Party, took to Instagram to declare that his center-right bloc will seek to form a government together.
Cause_General	Common for all parties within the two blocs is that they have all vowed not to collaborate with the Sweden Democrats.
Cause_General	Sweden Democrat leader Jimmie Akesson told Swedish media that he would like to form a government with the Moderate Party and the Christian Democrats, an invite that has not been accepted.
Cause_General	Lofven, on his part, has invited the Center Party and the Liberals to form a government with him, but the three parties do not have enough mandates to achieve a majority.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It could take weeks or even months"" before Sweden has a new government in place, the Social Democrats' parliamentary group leader Anders Ygeman told Swedish media on Monday as the party leadership gathered to discuss a way forward."
Cause_General	While the Social Democrats did not fare as bad as late opinion polls had indicated, with just 28.4 percent of the vote the result was still a historical low for the party that was once synonymous with the Swedish welfare state.
Cause_General	The Social Democrats' coalition partner, the Green Party, ended at 4.3 percent in the preliminary tally, just above the 4 percent electoral threshold.
Cause_General	The Left Party did comparatively well, up from 5.7 percent in the 2014 election to 7.9 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	"Akesson declared his party as the election's ""biggest winner"" after it gained 17.6 percent, cementing its position as Sweden's third biggest party."
Cause_General	However, while the Sweden Democrats made the biggest advances of all eight parliamentary parties, the results were not as positive as opinion polls had predicted.
Distant_Evaluation	Throughout the election campaign, the Sweden Democrats predicted they would be the second biggest, if not the biggest, party.
Distant_Evaluation	Still, the Sweden Democrats could be political kingmakers, a position they are likely to take maximum advantage of, according to Swedish Television's political commentator.
Distant_Evaluation	They will play an important role in what looks set to be a complicated and protracted process to form a new government.
Cause_General	The center-left bloc has the Social Democratic Party, the Green Party and Left party, while the opposition center-right alliance bloc has the Moderate Party, the Centre Party, the Liberal Party and the Christian Democrats.

Main	(Reuters) - Global warming has increased the likelihood of more massive, sluggish storms like Florence, capable of dropping record amounts of rain and causing the type of catastrophic flooding that crippled North and South Carolina this week, experts said.
Cause_Specific	Most meteorologists agree that climate change can increase the volume of water vapor stored within weather systems.
Cause_Specific	More water vapor means more rain, especially when the storm is a crawler like Florence, which slowed to about 2 miles per hour (3.2 km per hour) after slamming into the North Carolina coast.
Distant_Evaluation	When storms such as Harvey, which struck Texas last year, and Florence come to a virtual stall, a deluge of rain can fall in the matter of days, equal to what an area typically sees in a year, they said.
Distant_Evaluation	“It is compelling and sobering to see these storms come in back-to-back seasons,” said Jim Kossin, an atmospheric research scientist with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
Distant_Evaluation	His research suggests that global warming has affected the speed of storms as well as the amount of moisture they contain.
Cause_General	Florence, which has killed at least 36 people, dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday.
Cause_General	At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage, with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said.
Distant_Historical	It has been a little more than a year since Hurricane Harvey dumped trillions of gallons of water on Texas and the U.S. Gulf Coast, killing 68 people and causing an estimated $125 billion in property damage.
Cause_General	Based on data from about seven decades of storms, Kossin found tropical-cyclone speed had decreased globally by 10 percent from 1949 to 2016, according to a paper published in June in the scientific journal Nature.
Cause_Specific	The reason is that climate change is warming the Arctic much more than it is heating up the Tropics, easing the pressure difference between the two, he said in an interview on Wednesday.
Cause_Specific	Pressure differences drive the winds, which in turn can steer and slow down storms, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	In the case of Florence, warmer sea temperatures and the amount of available moisture in the air may have increased rainfall by as much as 50 percent in the hardest-hit areas, according to a study by researchers at Stony Brook University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Center for Atmospheric Research.
Distant_Evaluation	To make matters worse, Florence was about 50 miles (80 km) larger in diameter due to global warming, putting more people in harm’s way, the study showed.
Distant_Evaluation	“We can attribute that additional rainfall to human-induced climate change,” said Kevin Reed, a professor at Stony Brook University’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, who contributed to the study.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The paper, still unpublished, may fuel an ongoing debate in the scientific community about whether climate change, induced by human activity, has a direct impact on the strength and size of a storm.
Distant_Evaluation	Global warming has greatly increased the chances of another storm of Harvey’s magnitude hitting Texas again, according to a published study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Kerry Emanuel.
Distant_Evaluation	The likelihood of more massive rainfalls also should raise red flags for both coastal and inland communities and get them to rethink plans for storm-related inundation, experts said.
Distant_Evaluation	This includes planning for massive evacuations and making improvements to infrastructure related to water-flow resources to help ease the blow.
Cause_General	Most of the damage caused by Harvey and Florence has come from the flooding, which has devastated cities and rural areas, turning highways into rivers and pastures into lakes.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	“There is going to be both more inland flooding and more storm-surge, ocean-related flooding because the ocean is getting higher,” said Brion Callori, senior vice president of engineering and research at commercial property insurance firm FM Global.
Distant_Evaluation	“The biggest risk is burying your head in the sand and not understanding your exposure,” he said.
Cause_General	At the halfway mark between the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina last year and the beginning of the 2006 hurricane season on June 1, the Army Corps of Engineers has completed only 16 percent of its planned repairs to New Orleans's battered flood protection system, according to corps representatives.
Main	The corps says its work is on track for restoring the system to its pre-hurricane strength by the June 1 deadline, but in the meantime many groups that have studied the disaster are coming up with proposals of their own that they say could be cheaper, faster or stronger.
Main	The Bring New Orleans Back Commission, the group formed by Mayor C. Ray Nagin to produce a blueprint for the city's recovery, issued a proposal on Wednesday to upgrade hurricane protection with measures beyond what the corps has called for.
Main	To prevent storm surges from pushing into the city's drainage canals, the commission proposed a series of jetties to stand in front of the three canals, which it says could be built quickly and cheaply and provide New Orleans with some much-needed peace of mind.
Distant_Evaluation	''There is, very much, a tension between things that can be done quickly versus those that might take a little longer,'' Lawrence Roth, deputy executive director of the American Society of Civil Engineers, said in a telephone interview on Friday.
Cause_General	His group has weighed in with far-reaching recommendations, and other groups are preparing proposals of their own.
Main	The mayor's commission also proposed a network of dams that would block or slow the opening between the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal and Lake Pontchartrain, and block storm surges from flowing up the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation channel that has been blamed for a storm surge funnel effect that increased the damage to eastern New Orleans.
Main	The group is also calling for long-term flood-control structures that would block or slow surges at the two passes between Lake Pontchartrain and the Gulf of Mexico.
Main	The fast-track structures would cost $100 million to $170 million, according to the commission's estimates, a fraction of the $3.1 billion the federal government has proposed spending on flood control measures in the area.
Distant_Evaluation	The commission said its proposals would not interfere with any of the corps's plans, but would be add-ons that complement the current plans.
Distant_Evaluation	The proposals have not yet found broad support among other engineering experts who have been working on strengthening New Orleans's storm defenses, but Dan Hitchings, the director of the corps's Task Force Hope, which is coordinating the hurricane response in Louisiana and Mississippi, said the plans were welcome and would be examined.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Roth, of the Society of Civil Engineers, said there would always be competing ideas about how to improve flood protection.
Distant_Evaluation	The idea of jetties, he said, might be made moot by closing off the canals and putting in new pumping stations at the lake, as the corps has planned.
Distant_Evaluation	''Many different people can look at a problem and come up with many different solutions, all with tradeoffs,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''Which would be better -- jetties or a pump station?
Distant_Evaluation	You might never get an answer to that.''
Cause_General	Meanwhile, the corps's work to restore flood protection to its pre-hurricane levels continues around the clock.
Cause_General	This month the corps solicited bids for building temporary closures and pumps at the mouths of the city's three drainage canals, and it is rebuilding long stretches of levee in St. Bernard Parish and along the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal.
Cause_General	The corps is looking to measures that will further strengthen the flood protection system, including restoring levees to their originally designed heights.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	These measures can be in place by September 2007, according to the corps.
Cause_General	Beyond that, the corps has embarked on a two-year, $8 million study to determine how to strengthen the hurricane protection system for New Orleans and southern Louisiana.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A preliminary version of that report is due in June.
Distant_Evaluation	While the Bush administration's top official on Gulf Coast reconstruction, Donald Powell, has said the government will build a system that is ''better and stronger'' than what was there before, the administration has not committed to what the people of New Orleans desperately want: protection from Category 5 storms, the toughest that nature can dish out.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Hitchings said that the corps was slightly behind schedule but that he expected things to move quickly.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's not linear,'' he said, because the ''gear-up time'' to get contractors in place and to make materials like the enormous quantities of soil available was so great.
Distant_Evaluation	Now ''they're really moving out,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	The corps built 30 days of weather delays into the schedule, he said, and with a little help from favorable weather, ''I'm very optimistic that they will regain their schedule and in the end get it all finished with plenty of time.''
Distant_Evaluation	The corps's long-term study, he said, would probably have a lot in common with the outside proposals that are beginning to flow in, but ''right now, we're focused on the very near term.''
Cause_General	The engineering society is investigating the failure of the levees and is working with the groups that will monitor the corps's progress.
Cause_General	Its recommendations include ''armoring'' the dry side of levees so they are not eroded away from underneath if water spills over the top.
Distant_Evaluation	Without armoring, Mr. Roth said, ''failure is catastrophic because it causes the wall to fail.''
Cause_General	The corps has said that the armoring process, like other projects that would go beyond the restoration of the levees to pre-hurricane strength, will have to be approved by Congress.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's going to take people being willing to take a chance, to be bold, to sort out Louisiana's levee problems,'' said Ivor van Heerden, deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center and a member of Team Louisiana, the group formed by the state to investigate the causes of the levee failures.
Cause_General	His group, too, will be making proposals for upgrading protection for the region.
Distant_Evaluation	''We may get lucky,'' he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''Nature may give us another 10 years before we get another Katrina, or maybe not.
Distant_Evaluation	But we've got to seize the moment or we're going to lose coastal Louisiana.''

Main	WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019 due to factors including the diminishing effect of fiscal stimulus, further tightening of financial conditions, rising market volatility and trade uncertainty, experts have said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	With annualized growth rates of 2.2 percent, 4.2 percent and 3.4 percent for the first three quarters of 2018 respectively and a 2 percent range expected for the fourth quarter, the Federal Reserve estimated that the U.S. economy would wrap up the year with a 3 percent expansion, much higher than the average 2.2 percent annual rate between 2010 and 2017.
Cause_Specific	However, economists warned that the boom is by and large led by the U.S. government's tax cuts and spending increases, and that there are signs that the dividends of those measures are diminishing while the Fed's monetary tightening will weigh more on U.S. growth.
Cause_Specific	"""Fiscal boost becoming a fiscal drag and more tightening in financial conditions are going to mean that the growth is going to decelerate,"" Jeremie Cohen-Setton, research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank, told Xinhua in a recent interview."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He expected the U.S. economy to expand at around 2.5 percent in 2019.
Cause_Specific	"""The slack is diminishing, therefore you're going to have more wage pressures,"" he said, adding the Fed would continue tightening monetary policy as U.S. inflation ""is going to overshoot the target (of 2 percent) a little bit."""
Cause_General	The Fed raised interest rates for four times in 2018, and most Fed officials envisioned two rate hikes in 2019.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""It is more likely that the economy will grow in a way that will call for two interest rate increases over the course of next year,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell told a press conference on Dec. 19."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The Fed anticipated that U.S. economic growth would decelerate to 2.3 percent in 2019.
Distant_Evaluation	"Powell also emphasized at the press conference that the Fed's policy decisions are ""not on a preset course."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""There's a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the destination of any further increases,"" he said."
Distant_Evaluation	"But some experts argued that the Fed's latest rate hike in December, amid market volatility, was ""questionable"" and ""an error."""
Distant_Evaluation	"""It felt like a model-driven decision ... occurred despite market turmoil that had continued too long to be ignored,"" Tim Duy of the University of Oregon wrote recently in his Fed Watch column."
Distant_Evaluation	"Duy noted that there was ""no pressing reason"" for a rate hike other than Fed officials ""insist on defining policy on the back of long-run forecasts and feel compelled to follow-through with that policy."""
Distant_Evaluation	What will add to the downside risks, analysts said, is the prospect of a protracted stalemate over government budget, which has paralyzed a quarter of the federal government for more than a week now, leaving some 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay.
Distant_Evaluation	Although the impact of the partial government shutdown on the overall economy remains limited for the time being, it will no longer be negligible if the closure were to persist, especially in a time of market volatility.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Concerns about a loss of growth momentum in Asia and Europe would also likely weigh on U.S. growth.
Distant_Evaluation	"""For the rest of the world there seems to be some air coming out of the balloon."
Distant_Evaluation	"That will come back and also affect the U.S.,"" the International Monetary Fund's outgoing chief economist Maurice Obstfeld told reporters in early December."
Cause_Specific	Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump's alleged displeasure with Powell, the stock market turbulence and ongoing trade disputes are all stoking uncertainties in the U.S. economy heading into 2019.
Cause_Specific	Following the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs worldwide on the ground of national security, it is not yet clear whether the U.S. government will slap new duties on imported cars and car parts in 2019.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The European Commission warned in a written document sent to the U.S. Commerce Department in June that some 300 billion U.S. dollars' worth of U.S. exports will likely be hit by retaliatory measures from other economies subject to the potential auto tariffs.
Cause_General	In addition, whether the U.S. government is capable enough to respond to a slowing economy or other contingencies and stabilize the market remains to be seen.
Cause_Specific	Investors fear that a lack of experience coupled with personnel shortage may lead the U.S. government to miscalculation and policy failure, further unsettling the market.
Cause_General	"The U.S. Treasury Department had been blamed by market participants for sending, at times, ""muddled and confusing signals"", according to U.S. media."
Cause_General	In a move to quell market volatility, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Dec. 23 convened individual calls to chief executive officers of six major U.S. banks.
Cause_General	"""The banks all confirmed ample liquidity is available for lending to consumer and business markets,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement."
Cause_General	Mnuchin's effort to reach out to the private banking sector was not only rare for a senior government official, but also of no avail, as the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all tumbled more than 2 percent on the first trading day following the Treasury Department's statement.
Distant_Evaluation	"The New York Times said that Mnuchin conducted ""the type of discussions usually reserved for moments of crisis."""
Distant_Evaluation	Thomas Simons, a senior economist at Jefferies LLC in New York, pointed out that technical factors, including sell orders driven by tax considerations and low year-end volume, could exaggerate the plunge in the stock market.
Distant_Evaluation	"""The first couple weeks of January will be telling as to whether this selling in December was technically related or actually fundamentally based,"" he was quoted by Bloomberg as saying."
Cause_General	Despite a lift in major indices on Monday, U.S. stocks ended 2018 with the steepest annual declines since the 2008 financial crisis, and many have cautioned the coming of a bear market after almost a decade of bull run.
Main	ZURICH/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The performance of big wealth managers may take hit as a trade war between the United States and China hurts business in major growth market Asia, bankers said.

Cause_General	UBS (UBSG.S), Citi (C.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.S), HSBC (HSBA.L), Julius Baer (BAER.S) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) have relied on Asia to power private banking revenues.
Cause_Specific	But investors there are shying away from riskier assets and new investments due to volatile markets.
Cause_General	Asian stock markets have fallen as much as a fifth over the U.S.-Chinese trade row, touching off fears of an economic downturn.
Distant_Evaluation	“The recent emerging markets crisis and the trade war have definitely led clients to adopt a little bit more risk-off mode,” said Kwong Kin-Mun, managing director, head of wealth management for Southeast Asia at Deutsche Bank.
Distant_Evaluation	After a strong first quarter and a steady second quarter for the industry, he said the third quarter of was slower than normal.
Distant_Evaluation	He said the last three months was usually quieter too.
Distant_Evaluation	“There will still be opportunities for new relationships to be opened.
Distant_Evaluation	In China, you get millionaires every day,” he said.
Distant_Evaluation	“That’s why you see most of the banks are focusing a lot on China because that’s where really the wealth is growing.”
Distant_Evaluation	UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti said last week the world’s biggest wealth manager faced declining revenue from transactions in the third quarter, saying clients were “much, much more insecure”.
Distant_Evaluation	But he said the rest of the business was holding up.
Cause_General	Falling transactions are not the only challenge.
Cause_General	Lending income suffers when clients pare positions and fees recede as the value of assets dip.
Cause_General	Credit Suisse said it was also seeing a slowdown.
Distant_Evaluation	“What you see lately is less activity, less transaction, definitely lower volume,” a spokesman said, adding it was most noticeable in the Asia-Pacific region.
Distant_Anecdotal	A senior official from a leading European private bank who asked not to be identified said Asian clients were de-leveraging due to the trade row and because of rising U.S. interest rates and the impact on emerging markets.
Distant_Anecdotal	“We do see clients are becoming a bit more defensive in terms of their asset allocations and their short-term cash holding has been increasing,” he said, although he said some investors were being attracted by the lower prices.
Distant_Anecdotal	He said customers were putting less focus on equity positions and some had trimmed high-yield bond positions.
Distant_Anecdotal	“In exchange, they are going for safer assets — on the equities side more defensive stocks like the utilities and in the fixed-income space some of the shorter dated bonds or some hybrid bonds or some floating rate instruments,” he said.

Main	BEIJING, Jan. 2 (Xinhua) -- China's central bank decided Wednesday to ease evaluation rules for qualifying financial institutions to enjoy lower reserve requirement ratios (RRR) in a move to encourage inclusive financing.
Main_Consequence	Financial institutions can deposit less in the central bank as reserve money if they lend a certain share of their loans to small and micro firms each borrowing less than ten million yuan (1.46 million U.S. dollars) from them, the People's Bank of China said in a statement.
Cause_General	The evaluation threshold for inclusive financing is lifted from five million yuan, and the new policy takes effect immediately.
Cause_Specific	The move will help the preferentially targeted RRR cut cover more financial institutions, encouraging them to serve more small and micro firms which are usually in high demand of credit.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The State Council said late last December that China will improve its policies for targeted reserve requirement ratio cuts to encourage inclusive financing.
Distant_Anecdotal	PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Andrew Lamonica, 64, a retired power company worker and lifelong Panama City Beach resident, ignored orders to evacuate ahead of one of the strongest hurricanes ever to hit the United States and waited out the storm in his rented bungalow.

Distant_Anecdotal	With a mighty crack, a tall pine crashed onto his house, drenching the interior as rain leaked through the shattered roof.
Distant_Anecdotal	Two other trees on his property came down, but his 2011 Cadillac - “my baby” - survived without a scratch.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I’ve lived here all my life and the storm brought things I’ve never seen,” Lamonica said.
Distant_Anecdotal	“There were several times I thought maybe I should have left.”
Distant_Evaluation	Lamonica was lucky.
Main_Consequence	In the first fatality related to Wednesday’s arrival of Hurricane Michael, local authorities reported a “male subject” was killed by a tree toppling onto his house in the Tallahassee area.
Main_Consequence	Michael inflicted damage to Panama City unevenly, impaling some businesses with sign poles while leaving others virtually unscathed.
Main_Consequence	By nightfall, the city was under curfew, darkened without power, its streets littered with downed power lines, fallen trees and debris.
Distant_Anecdotal	Joey Morrison, a 30-year-old glass worker, said Michael beat so hard on his apartment door in Panama City Beach with its 155 mile-per-hour (250 km-per-hour) winds that he had to reinforce it by drilling in screws - and still had to sit against the door to keep it shut.
Distant_Anecdotal	“I got scared enough that I was thinking, ‘I should have left.’ Because this isn’t like anything that ever happened here,” Morrison recounted.
Distant_Evaluation	Some of those who did evacuate from Panama City Beach were no less terrified.
Distant_Anecdotal	“My God, it’s scary.
Distant_Anecdotal	I didn’t expect all this,” said Bill Manning, 63, a grocery store clerk who left his camper in Panama City to move into a hotel.
Distant_Anecdotal	He watched through a window as trees and poles swayed.
Distant_Anecdotal	“Panama City, I don’t know if there will be much left,” Manning said.
Main	Michael crashed ashore at Mexico Beach, about 20 miles (30 km) east of Panama City, as a Category 4 storm before charging inland across the Southeast.
Distant_Evaluation	Its rapid intensification in the warm waters of the Gulf took many by surprise.
Cause_General	As recently as the weekend, Michael was expected to hit the Panhandle as a tropical storm.
Cause_General	Mandatory evacuation orders were largely heeded by the 50,000 residents of Panama City Beach and Panama City, a pair of towns dotted with attractions designed like shipwrecks and volcanoes to amuse the thousands of tourists who flock there during the warm months.
Distant_Anecdotal	Bill Bryant, a Navy veteran, moved his family into one of the few hotels that remained open.
Distant_Anecdotal	“The smart thing would have been to evacuate farther inland,” said Bryant, 48.
Cause_General	All but a few businesses had closed and were boarded up by Tuesday evening, leaving streets empty.
Cause_General	Even the local Waffle House restaurant was shuttered.
Cause_General	The diner chain is famous for its 24-hour service 365 days a year and the “Waffle House Index” - whether it is open or closed - has become an indicator to gauge the severity of a disaster.

Main	CAIRO, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court confirmed on Monday death sentence against 20 members of Muslim Brotherhood group over storming a police station and killing 14 policemen, officials news agency MENA reported.
Main	The Court of Cassation, Egypt's top court that gives final verdicts, upheld death verdicts against 20 militants, mostly loyalists and members of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood group of former Islamist President Mohamed Morsi.
Cause_Specific	The defendants stormed the main police station in Kerdasa district, a stronghold of the Muslim Brotherhood at that time, of Giza province in mid-August 2013, killing 17 people including 14 policemen.
Distant_Historical	"The assault, known as ""Kerdasa massacre,"" took place more than a month following Morsi's military removal on July 3, 2013 and shortly after a massive security crackdown on two pro-Morsi sit-ins on Aug. 14, 2013, in Cairo and Giza, which left hundreds dead and thousands more arrested."
Distant_Historical	The case originally involves 188 defendants including fugitives.
Distant_Historical	In February 2015, the court sentenced 183 of them to death and a minor to 10 years in jail.
Distant_Historical	After appeals, later in February 2016, the Court of Cassation ordered the retrial of 156 of them.
Distant_Historical	In April 2017, the criminal court recommended death penalty for 20 of them and referred their case documents to the Grand Mufti, the country's interpreter of religious law, to get his religious opinion on their execution.
Distant_Historical	He later approved.
Cause_General	They appealed the death sentence later, but the court of cassation rejected their appeal on Monday.
Cause_General	Most Brotherhood leaders, members and supporters, including Morsi himself and the Brotherhood spiritual guide Mohamed Badie, are currently jailed.
Cause_General	Many of them have received appealable death sentences and life imprisonments over various charges varying from inciting violence and murder to espionage and jailbreak.
Cause_General	Morsi is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence over inciting deadly clashes between his supporters and opponents in late 2012 and a 25-year jail term over leaking classified documents to Qatar.
Main	In a rare reprise to a rare trial, the jury that convicted a Long Island man of murder by depraved indifference last October in a drunken-driving crash that killed a limousine driver and a 7-year-old girl may be brought back to court for hearings on whether some members acted improperly during deliberations.
Cause_Specific	In an answer submitted on Dec. 29 to a defense motion, Robert Hayden, an assistant Nassau County district attorney, agreed that a hearing should be held to determine if jurors discussed what they believed were prior drunken-driving charges against the defendant, Martin Heidgen, 25.
Cause_Specific	Such accusations were not included in the evidence introduced in the five-week trial, and could be considered a contamination of the jury proceedings.
Distant_Evaluation	Beyond that, Mr. Hayden said in his answer, that the belief of a previous drunken-driving arrest was ''not true,'' as far as he knew.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Hayden said the hearing should be limited to that issue, and rebuffed as ''irrelevant'' several other claims of impropriety raised by Mr. Heidgen's lawyer, Stephen LaMagna, as causes for setting aside the guilty verdict.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. LaMagna also claimed that some jurors felt pressured to vote to convict Mr. Heidgen of the most serious charge, that some discussed the case outside the jury room, and that one said she planned to write a book about it.
Distant_Evaluation	The Heidgen case was unusual because the defendant was prosecuted for a fatal drunken-driving crash under laws treating his crime as the functional equivalent of intentional murder.
Distant_Evaluation	Such prosecutions, while not unprecedented, are considered rare and are usually brought only in the most horrific cases.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Heidgen, whose blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit, was driving the wrong way on the Meadowbrook Parkway when his pickup truck crashed head-on with a limousine taking a family home from a wedding.
Distant_Historical	The crash killed the limousine driver, Stanley Rabinowitz, 59, and Katie Flynn, who had been the flower girl.
Distant_Historical	The girl's parents and grandparents, who were also in the limousine, suffered minor injuries.
Distant_Historical	After three days of deliberations, the jury told Acting Justice Alan R. Honorof of State Supreme Court that it was deadlocked, but after he sent them back for more deliberations, reached a verdict on the fifth day.
Distant_Anecdotal	Within days of the verdict, though, the jury forewoman said she had felt pressured to vote for the charge of ''murder by depraved indifference'' that Mr. Heidgen was convicted of, even though she believed he was guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter.
Cause_General	Based on the depraved indifference conviction, Mr. Heidgen faces a minimum of 25 years in prison.
Cause_General	Manslaughter carries a minimum of 15 years.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Heidgen's lawyer, who could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, has said that based on interviews with other jury members, he believed that some jurors browbeat the last two holdouts who thought Mr. Heidgen was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder.
Distant_Evaluation	''It is fairly rare for hearings like these to be held,'' said George Goltzer, vice president of the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
Distant_Evaluation	''The general rule is that you don't let a jury impeach its own verdict.
Distant_Evaluation	But if the charges are serious -- say that racism or serious misconduct was involved in the decision or something like that -- the courts have allowed it.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Goltzer said he was not too familiar with the case, but added that evidence of ''extra-record information'' -- not part of the evidence introduced at the trial -- might qualify as serious enough to review a jury's verdict.
Cause_General	Justice Honorof is expected to decide in the next few days if and when hearings should be held.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A spokesman for the district attorney, Kathleen Rice, said it was expected that with the district attorney's assent, the hearings would be scheduled.
Main	BANGKOK, Aug. 6 (Xinhua) -- Thai authorities on Monday warned residents in western Thailand against water runoffs from a dam in Petchburi Province bordering Myanmar.
Cause_Specific	The Phetchaburi Irrigation Department said the Kaeng Krachan Dam had already received up to 708 million cubic meters of water till Monday, or 99.7 percent of its capacity.
Main	Phetchaburi's five districts downstream from Kaeng Krachan Dam are warned of further flooding due to water discharge from the dam.
Main_Consequence	The department said that municipal area will come under water about 25-30 cm deep and flow downstream to the Ban Laem district.
Cause_General	The Crisis Ad Hoc Center has dispatched 20 water-pushing boats to pump water from the Khlong D Canal into the sea.
Cause_General	Since Saturday night, hundreds of residents were seen filling sacks of sand to place them in front of their houses to fend off flood water.
Cause_General	The ad hoc center was also preparing to evacuate residents to higher grounds.
Cause_General	The Kaeng Krachan Dam, a multi-purpose dam built in 1966, stands at 760 meters long and 58 meters high.
Cause_General	Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department chief Chayapol Thitisak said on Monday that nine provinces in the northeastern region were still affected by flooding as a result of heavy rain and overflow from the Mekong River.
Cause_General	"""With the monsoonal rain, we have seen 100,000 people affected by flood and landslides in 27 provinces in just two weeks,"" said Chayapol."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""It will take at least two months for flood water to recede."""

Main	"BERLIN, Oct. 2 (Xinhua) -- Ongoing investigations by the German Public Prosecutor General into a suspected neo-Nazi terror organization, known as ""Revolution Chemnitz"", have sparked further public debate in Germany over the country's increasingly assertive right-wing extremist scene on Tuesday."
Main	"Katrin Goering-Eckardt, the leader of the Green party (Gruene) parliamentary faction told the newspaper ""Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung"" that the recent arrest of eight individuals in connection to the formation of ""Revolution Chemnitz"" was a ""wake-up call"" for policymakers."
Main	"In light of the latest developments, Goering-Eckardt criticized attempts by parts of the federal government to downplay the threat of right-wing extremism as ""reckless."""
Main	"The Green party politician complained that while the ""grand coalition"" was busy with internal quarrels following the Chemnitz marches, the right-wing scene had mobilized and apparently tried to prepare terror attacks and plan a right-wing extreme revolution."
Cause_General	Goering-Eckardt's comments were made on the same day as four suspected far-right terrorists were presented to the German Federal Supreme Court to determine whether they will continue to be remanded in custody.
Cause_General	In total, eight local men are believed by the Public Prosecutor General to have formed a terror cell operating in Chemnitz which planned attacks against foreigners and political opponents and were already in the process of acquiring firearms towards that end.
Cause_General	It is further seen as likely by prosecutors that the suspects were involved in recent incidents of right-wing extremist violence witnessed during a series of widely-publicized demonstrations in Chemnitz.
Main	Following the still unresolved murder of Daniel H. in late August, thousands took to the streets in the East German town to voice their anger at an attack which far-right local activists have blamed on asylum seekers.
Cause_General	Over the course of the two weeks, local police repeatedly struggled to retain control of the situation, as violent protestors threatened, assaulted and chased civilians with foreign appearances, clashed with a separate anti-Nazi demonstration.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"The suspected participation of ""Revolution Chemnitz"" members in assaults against foreigners on Sept. 14 are hereby viewed by investigators as a test-run for a larger-scale attack in the near future, possibly scheduled for the upcoming Day of German Unity."
Cause_General	"The ""Revolution Chemnitz"" cell is only the latest of several far-right terror groups which German security and judicial authorities have contended with in recent years."
Distant_Historical	"As recently as July, Beate Zschaepe was sentenced to life in prison as the primary suspect in the closely-watched ""National Socialist Underground"" trial which ran for more than five years."
Cause_General	"The NSU achieved international notoriety for committing the so-called ""Bosporus Serial Murders"", which witnessed the killing of one police officer and nine civilians with migratory backgrounds, as well as being responsible for a series of bombings and armed robberies."
Distant_Historical	"Additionally, eight members of the Saxony-based far-right ""Freital Group"" were convicted in March for attempted murder and forming a terrorist organization."
Distant_Historical	Amongst others, the group carried out bomb attacks against five refugee accommodation centers in 2015.
Main	TOKYO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from landslides and floods caused by widespread torrential rain across western Japan has risen to 112, with at least three others in a critical condition, public broadcaster NHK said Monday.
Cause_General	Authorities have also said that 79 people still remain unaccounted for and, as such, the death toll will likely increase.
Cause_General	Search and rescue operations have been continuing in disaster-hit areas, like Hiroshima Prefecture where 44 people have been pronounced dead.
Cause_General	Other hard-hit regions where fatalities have been reported include Okayama, Ehime, Kyoto, Yamaguchi, Fukuoka, Kagoshima, Hyogo, Shiga, Gifu, Kochi and Saga prefectures.
Cause_General	The rescue operations have seen local municipalities enlist the help of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) as the ferocity of the storm and the torrential rain has caused the most amount of deaths seen here in recent decades.
Cause_General	Many people are still believed to be stranded inside their homes due to them not having access to roads, access roads being flooded or general flooding, local media reported Monday.
Cause_General	According to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency, evacuation orders or advisories had been issues to nearly 6 million people spanning 19 prefectures.
Cause_General	As of Monday morning, they said that 23,000 people were still staying at emergency evacuation shelters, with blazing heat now compounding the problem.
Cause_General	Temperature of up to 55.9 degrees Celsius was recorded in one city in Oita Prefecture, and Japan's Meteorological Agency (JMA) has warned those staying in or providing emergency relief in evacuation shelters to be wary of heatstroke.
Cause_General	Due to the scale of the national disaster, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is to cancel a trip to four countries, so he can deal with the relevant ministries involved with the disaster, local media reported on Monday afternoon.
Cause_General	Abe had planned to visit Belgium, France, Saudi Arabia and Egypt from Wednesday.
Cause_General	Earlier, Abe had told a meeting of a disaster response unit set up to deal with the flooding that the number of rescue personnel including SDF personal sent to the scene had increased to 73,000.
Distant_Evaluation	"Abe said they are ""making utmost efforts to save lives."""
Cause_General	As of Monday morning, the health ministry said the water supply to more than 13,600 households remained cutoff and 267,000 households were still without electricity.
Cause_General	The torrential rain caused major disruption to transportation systems with the transport ministry confirming that there had been around 238 landslides in 28 prefectures.
Cause_General	More than 200 floods had also been recorded along state-managed rivers, the ministry also said.
Cause_General	The transport ministry said that 13 railroad operators were suspending services on 37 routes in western Japan and other places as of Monday morning.
Cause_General	Damaged from landslides has been confirmed by West Nippon Expressway Company at 47 points on expressways across nine prefectures.
Cause_General	These include in Fukuoka and Hiroshima, where six sections of these expressways are entirely closed due to the damage, the road company said.
Cause_General	Major business have shuttered their factories and offices to ensure the safety of their workers, particularly in Kyoto, Hiroshima and Yamaguchi, according to their spokespeople.
Cause_General	These businesses include automakers Toyota Motor Corp., Mazda Motor Corp. and Daihatsu Motor Co.
Main	FOR investors who have been missing out on the prolonged run-up in the shares of real estate investment trusts, or maybe jumped in only recently, the end may not be in sight: there are growing opportunities overseas.
Distant_Evaluation	Some industry experts say that this is an opportune time to make a move into these nascent markets.
Distant_Evaluation	''We don't think the U.S. REIT market is played out; it will continue its upward growth,'' said Steven Carroll, co-chief investment officer at CB Richard Ellis Global Real Estate Securities.
Main	''But we think the growth will escalate at a much more rapid pace overseas as more markets become securitized.''
Cause_General	Last week, Britain became the latest country to offer REITs.
Cause_General	The corporate structure gives real estate companies favorable tax treatment in exchange for disbursing most of their income to shareholders.
Cause_General	The addition of Britain brings to 17 the number of countries with public REIT markets, according to UBS Investment Bank; there are also about a dozen other countries with legislation in place or under consideration to create REITs, though with no public market yet.
Distant_Historical	Germany is expected to offer REITs this spring.
Distant_Historical	In 1994, only three countries outside the United States allowed REITs, according to UBS.
Cause_General	While the United States is still the world's dominant REIT market, with around $395 billion in market capitalization out of an estimated worldwide total of $608 billion, last year's spate of announced mergers and acquisitions is steadily reducing the number of publicly traded shares.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A recent report by Ernst & Young suggests that the rest of the globe is poised to surpass the United States by 2008 in terms of total capitalization.
Main	Much of the new growth, it says, is being driven by REIT markets in Australia, France, Japan, Canada, the Netherlands, Singapore and Hong Kong.
Main	The report noted, meanwhile, that some of the lesser-known REIT markets like South Africa have had stellar performances.
Distant_Historical	In fact, a global real estate index offered by the European Public Real Estate Association, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and FTSE had a 42.35 percent return last year.
Distant_Historical	The domestic REIT market, as measured by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, rose 34.35 percent in 2006, the seventh consecutive year that REITs outperformed the overall stock market.
Distant_Evaluation	''If you're an investor, it may well be a great opportunity to diversify,'' said Dale Anne Reiss, the global leader of Ernst & Young's real estate practice.
Distant_Evaluation	''You can really play the real estate market more effectively now.''
Distant_Evaluation	She added that shares in some of the newer markets might be undervalued right now because of ''pricing inefficiencies'' in the underlying assets of some REITs.
Distant_Evaluation	Ralph L. Block, author of ''Investing in REITs'' (Bloomberg Press, 2006) and the publisher of The Essential REIT, a newsletter, agreed that ''there are some significant pockets of opportunity.''
Distant_Evaluation	But he warned that ''when someone finds a great opportunity, it usually means that opportunity gets recognized pretty quickly.''
Distant_Evaluation	Big investors are already on the lookout.
Distant_Historical	Nearly two-thirds of real estate professionals surveyed last year by the international law firm Bryan Cave said they planned to invest abroad within the next 12 months.
Distant_Evaluation	And institutional investors -- which sank dizzying amounts of money into domestic REITs last year -- are also increasing their exposure to international real estate.
Cause_General	Among those increasing allocations into global REITs is the California Public Employees' Retirement System, known as Calpers, the largest public pension fund with more than $200 billion in assets.
Distant_Evaluation	Smaller investors are also finding more opportunities to branch out.
Cause_General	In addition to the expanding number of foreign real estate stocks that can be bought through brokers, there are more mutual funds focused on international property.
Cause_General	At the same time, domestic REITs are acquiring more foreign property or forging partnerships.
Cause_General	They include companies like ProLogis, the AMB Property Corporation and the Simon Property Group.
Cause_General	Some of the funds rolled out last year include the Franklin Global REIT fund, Cohen & Steers Asia Pacific Realty Shares and the ING International Real Estate fund.
Cause_General	The first foreign real estate index fund -- the Northern Global Real Estate Index fund from the Northern Trust Corporation -- also made its debut, along with the first global real estate exchange-traded fund: the streetTracks International Real Estate E.T.F., from State Street Global Advisors.
Distant_Evaluation	Many industry analysts are bullish about the office markets in the West End of London and in central Tokyo, which, they say, have a constrained supply of space.
Main	Jeremy Anagnos, the co-chairman with Mr. Carroll of CB Richard Ellis Global Real Estate Securities, says that the Japanese market in particular is primed to rally after ''coming out of its real estate recession that has lasted for 15 years.''
Main	He says that Germany, Europe's largest economy, offers potential opportunities, too.
Distant_Evaluation	By many accounts, that country is set to roll into the public markets more than $100 billion in properties.
Main	But the foreign markets are also being supported by an aging population that is looking increasingly for higher-yielding fixed-income investments, Mr. Anagnos added, and REITs can help to satisfy that demand.
Distant_Evaluation	Many individuals, particularly in Asia, were unable to invest in commercial real estate until REITs came along, he said.
Distant_Evaluation	Changes in the way some foreign corporations operate are also helping to create more opportunities for domestic REITs, some experts say.
Cause_General	ProLogis, in particular, has had a flurry of activity, including large acquisitions in Britain and the initial public offering of its ProLogis European Properties division.
Cause_General	The company is one of the world's largest managers and developers of distribution centers.
Distant_Evaluation	''When we started moving into Europe, the original thought was to serve our U.S. customers that had an international requirement,'' said Jeffrey H. Schwartz, the chief executive of ProLogis.
Distant_Evaluation	''But it has become much more synergistic and powerful than that.''
Distant_Evaluation	More business, he said, is now coming from companies in Europe and Asia looking to streamline their operations.
Distant_Evaluation	''They used to want to see how big they could become without concern about return on equity,'' Mr. Schwartz said.
Distant_Evaluation	''Now they are looking at how they can create shareholder value, and part of doing that is to become less asset-intensive.''
Cause_General	More than 40 percent of the company's $25.3 billion in real estate assets under management are outside North America, he said, and in Japan, the average occupancy rate for storage facilities is 99.8 percent, versus 95 percent in the United States.
Main	Mr. Schwartz says he sees opportunities in Central European countries like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.
Distant_Evaluation	His next big focus, though, is China.
Distant_Historical	Last year, ProLogis announced that it was developing an industrial park in Beijing to serve as the primary logistics and distribution center for the 2008 Olympics.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Ms. Reiss, meanwhile, says she believes that it won't be long before multinational assets become commonplace in real estate companies.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''It is quite conceivable,'' she said, ''that you will see assets in Mumbai and Milwaukee and Moscow and Malaysia -- all in the same REIT.''
Error	SQUARE FEET: VENTURES
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	ONE day this winter, on a pilgrimage that will be either blessedly cathartic or unbearably painful, a retired telecommunications worker and graphic artist named Dom Caruso will make his first visit to two gravesites at St. John's Cemetery in Middle Village, Queens.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr. Caruso, a 70-year-old grandfather in fragile health, will begin by bowing his head at the final resting place of his brother Joey, who died in childhood from the ravages of diphtheria.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Then he will stop at the partly submerged burial vault of Dr. Casper Pendola, the young physician who attended to the boy in his final, feverish hours.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At the visit, Mr. Caruso will grapple with how these two departed souls, whose paths crossed by chance, ended up linked forever in a saga of anger and murder.
Distant_Evaluation	The case turned the state against an individual, the medical establishment against the immigrant community, and family against family, while plunging Mr. Caruso into torment for most of his adult life.
Distant_Historical	Eighty years ago next month -- on Feb. 13, 1927 -- Joey Caruso, age 6, died in a tenement apartment in the broad swath of New York then known simply as South Brooklyn.
Distant_Historical	That same day, 27-year-old Dr. Pendola, who like Joey was of Sicilian heritage, died in the same apartment.
Distant_Historical	The child succumbed to disease.
Distant_Historical	The doctor was the victim of cold-blooded murder.
Distant_Historical	And the man who killed him, first by strangling him, then by slashing his throat so severely that his head was nearly severed from his body, was Francesco Caruso, Joey's father.
Distant_Historical	Sensational by any standards, the slaying set off a maelstrom of news media frenzy, ethnic hatred, ethical and legal debate, and volatile emotion that would keep New York and much of the rest of the nation in thrall for months.
Distant_Historical	The case became a cause célèbre, a campaign for justice for Italian immigrants that drew in Fiorello La Guardia, Clarence Darrow and other boldface names of the day.
Distant_Historical	But however broad the issue became, at its core were a child's death and a father's grief and rage.
Distant_Historical	A Laugh, or a Twitch?
Distant_Historical	According to court testimony and other documents, this is how events of that terrible night unfolded.
Distant_Historical	Francesco Caruso, a beefy, 35-year-old Sicilian immigrant and laborer known as Cheech, lived at 36 Third Street, near Smith Street, with his wife and six children.
Distant_Historical	On Feb. 11, his son Joey developed a bad sore throat.
Distant_Historical	The father tried to treat him with over-the-counter remedies.
Distant_Historical	But the next night, the boy took a turn for the worse.
Distant_Historical	With no phone in the apartment, the father ran to a local drugstore, owned by one Joseph Pendola, and the pharmacist telephoned his brother, a physician who lived in Maspeth, Queens.
Distant_Historical	Arriving around 10:45 that night, Dr. Pendola examined Joey, who lay feverish on a cot in the kitchen, and diagnosed his condition as diphtheria, a bacterial disease that ravages the upper respiratory system.
Distant_Historical	The doctor wrote prescriptions for 10,000 units of antitoxin, to be injected, and a second medication, to be given orally.
Distant_Historical	The father filled both prescriptions at the Pendola pharmacy, then returned to the apartment, where Dr. Pendola injected the antitoxin.
Distant_Historical	Leaving the father to administer the oral medication, the doctor departed, promising to return the next morning.
Distant_Historical	During the night, however, Joey grew sicker and eventually became delirious.
Distant_Historical	According to testimony his father gave in court, at one point the boy stood up in bed and announced, ''Papa, I am dying.''
Distant_Historical	By 10 the next morning, the doctor had not returned.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Caruso raced back to the pharmacy and called for an ambulance.
Distant_Historical	He returned home to find that his son had gone into convulsions.
Distant_Historical	The boy died in his arms.
Distant_Historical	Not until noon did Dr. Pendola reappear at the apartment.
Distant_Historical	It was the events that followed that led to the bloodletting.
Distant_Historical	According to Mr. Caruso's testimony in court, upon being informed of the child's death, the doctor simply laughed, although the New York Court of Appeals would later characterize the doctor's reaction as ''some twitching of the facial muscles that might be mistaken for a smile.''
Distant_Historical	Whatever actually occurred, the enraged father wrapped his powerful hands around Dr. Pendola's throat and began strangling him.
Distant_Historical	When the doctor fell, Mr. Caruso pulled a butcher knife from a closet and stabbed him twice, fatally, in the throat.
Distant_Historical	By nightfall, Mr. Caruso was in police custody, charged with first-degree murder.
Distant_Historical	Newspaper articles describing the crime were predictably sensational.
Distant_Historical	''Physician Is Slain by Crazed Father as Boy Patient Dies,'' blared the headline in The New York Times.
Distant_Historical	''Crazed Father Flees Bier; Confesses After Capture,'' shouted The Daily News.
Distant_Historical	Taking note of Mr. Caruso's Sicilian heritage and lack of formal education, the articles variously described the defendant as ''dull-eyed and expressionless,'' an ''ignorant father'' given to speaking ''broken English,'' and ''a raging giant whose black eyes were afire with hate and revenge.''
Distant_Historical	Deliberations, and Death Row
Distant_Historical	The trial, before Judge Alonzo McLaughlin in Kings County Court, then at Joralemon Street and Boerum Place in Downtown Brooklyn, had moments of high drama.
Distant_Historical	Jury selection, which began April 4, proved to be a complicated affair and took two days.
Distant_Historical	When a brief postponement was granted, the doctor's distraught widow, Helen, stood up in the gallery and shouted: ''This man murdered my husband, and it was a cruel, cold murder!
Distant_Historical	He should be killed.
Distant_Historical	Instead, he gets an adjournment.''
Distant_Historical	Once the testimony got under way, the defendant's own words were chilling.
Distant_Historical	''I said he had killed my boy and I was going to kill him,'' Mr. Caruso said of the doctor.
Distant_Historical	''Soon he didn't breathe anymore, and I ran to the kitchen, got a carving knife and stabbed him in the throat.
Distant_Historical	My wife stood in the doorway and saw it all.''
Distant_Historical	Ultimately, the jury rejected the defense's argument that Mr. Caruso was suffering from temporary insanity and concluded that his actions had been deliberate and premeditated.
Distant_Historical	On April 7, Mr. Caruso was convicted of first-degree murder, which carried an automatic death sentence.
Distant_Historical	As the judge congratulated the Caruso jurors, noting that ''any other finding would have been a miscarriage of justice,'' the defendant was packed off to death row at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining.
Distant_Historical	Star-Studded Counsel
Distant_Historical	Then the tide turned.
Distant_Historical	A campaign to spare Mr. Caruso's life picked up momentum among Italian-American friendship societies.
Distant_Historical	An ambitious New York congressman named Fiorello La Guardia visited the Caruso family.
Distant_Historical	A defense committee was organized by a press agent named Alexander Marky, and thanks to him, Mr. Caruso's wife and daughter were able to make appeals for mercy over the radio.
Distant_Historical	The defense committee recruited renowned lawyers to its cause, including Walter Pollak, who would later help defend the young African-Americans sentenced to death in the notorious Scottsboro Boys case.
Distant_Historical	The committee's most prominent member was Clarence Darrow, the legendary defender of evolution in the Scopes ''monkey trial,'' who came out of retirement to help draft Mr. Caruso's appeal.
Distant_Historical	On Nov. 22, alleging 14 trial errors and citing more than 100 other cases, this star-studded legal team persuaded the Court of Appeals to void Mr. Caruso's conviction for first-degree murder and order a new trial.
Distant_Historical	The court's chief judge was Benjamin Cardozo, who would go on to join the United States Supreme Court.
Distant_Historical	At the Caruso home, the defendant's family celebrated the good news with a fat Thanksgiving turkey.
Distant_Historical	At the Pendola home, the doctor's widow rocked her baby daughter, Catherine, and wept.
Distant_Historical	''We have nothing to be thankful for,'' she told reporters.
Distant_Historical	''My baby and I are alone.
Distant_Historical	And the man who killed my husband, my baby's father, is alive and may go free.''
Distant_Historical	Mr. Caruso's new trial began two months later, and this time around, matters took some curious turns.
Distant_Historical	A jury was impaneled in a brisk two hours; the very next day, Jan. 31, 1928, Judge McLaughlin, who had presided at the first trial and sentenced Mr. Caruso to death a scant nine months earlier, halted the proceedings to allow Mr. Caruso to plead guilty to first-degree manslaughter.
Distant_Historical	The prosecutor, on record as saying Mr. Caruso should face the first-degree murder charge again in the second trial, also did a turnabout, agreeing to the manslaughter plea.
Distant_Historical	The judge then sentenced the defendant to serve a maximum of 20 years.
Distant_Historical	In the end, Mr. Caruso served only six years.
Distant_Historical	Returning to his family, he fathered another son, Dom, and lived the rest of his life in relative obscurity, working as a laborer, a house painter and a caretaker.
Distant_Historical	He died in 1968, at age 77.
Cause_General	After the Anguish
Distant_Evaluation	For decades, Dom Caruso had a troubled relationship with his father, who, in the son's eyes, despised him because he could never replace his beloved brother.
Distant_Anecdotal	As Dom remembered it, his mother once told him that his father had tried to have the midwife write the name ''Joey'' on his birth certificate when he was born, but the mother had vehemently rejected the idea.
Main	One morning in 1952, when Dom was 16, his father sat him down at the breakfast table of their Jericho, Long Island, home and, already drunk on red wine, as was his custom, began to tell an extraordinary story.
Main	According to Dom, his father said that Dr. Pendola was not the first man he had murdered.
Main	The father, a strapping man of 230 pounds, said that he was a longtime ''made man'' in the Sicilian Mafia, and that, through beatings, knifings and shootings, he had served as an enforcer for Salvatore D'Aquila, an Al Capone associate and the capo di tutti capi of the New York Mafia.
Main	So, Dom Caruso recounted, when Cheech Caruso found himself facing the electric chair, he was not abandoned.
Main	Al Capone and Salvatore D'Aquila helped to set up a defense fund, hire top-flight lawyers to work on Mr. Caruso's appeal, and orchestrate the abrupt denouement of the second murder trial by pressuring Gov.
Main	Alfred E. Smith or one of his top lieutenants.
Main	The governor, who would run for president that year, enjoyed huge support from Italian-Americans.
Distant_Evaluation	The father's tale is almost impossible to substantiate.
Cause_General	On the one hand, Dom Caruso has no physical evidence of the father's statements about the Mafia and the trial.
Cause_General	Moreover, Dom's own family has been at least partly skeptical of the tale; for example, his siblings hotly disputed Dom's claim, based on his talk with his father, that their brother Sal had been named after Salvatore D'Aquila.
Distant_Evaluation	As for the involvement of Smith's administration, the best evidence is very unspecific.
Distant_Evaluation	Thomas Reppetto, author of ''American Mafia: A History of Its Rise to Power,'' said that the governor was undeniably under the sway of powerful party bosses, particularly those in Tammany Hall, who would not have hesitated to seek a favor from the Mafia.
Distant_Evaluation	But, Mr. Reppetto also said, he knew of no proof that Al Smith had ever done favors for the Mafia.
Distant_Evaluation	On the other hand, there are some facts that lend weight to the father's story.
Distant_Historical	On the day after Mr. Caruso's arraignment, for instance, The New York Times noted that in 1918 Francesco Caruso had been arrested by the police and fined $100 for carrying a concealed pistol, not a fix encountered by a regular laborer.
Distant_Historical	Then there are the turnabouts of the judge and prosecutor at the second trial, and the question of how the costly appeals effort on Mr. Caruso's behalf was financed, even if it was a cause célèbre.
Distant_Evaluation	Whatever the truth may be, it is difficult to know exactly what relatives of the victim may have felt about this claim or about the case in general.
Cause_General	Attempts to reach direct descendants of Dr. Pendola -- through death, Social Security and newspaper records and through St. John's Cemetery -- were unsuccessful.
Cause_General	Among relatives who could be located and did agree to speak was Michael Criss, whose great-grandfather Pietro Pendola was Dr. Pendola's cousin.
Cause_General	Mr. Criss, who teaches at Oklahoma State University and is the unofficial historian of the Pendola family in the United States, said he had first heard about the murder from cousins who were small children when it occurred.
Distant_Evaluation	''I think what Caruso did was heinous,'' Mr. Criss said, ''even if you take into consideration his emotional state.
Distant_Evaluation	However, I see no reason to blame his family and descendants for his actions.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	When one of those descendants, Dom Caruso, visits St. John's Cemetery, the first member of his family ever to do so, he will find two graves about a 10-minute walk from each other.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	They are remarkable for their unremarkableness.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Joey's final resting place is an unmarked charity grave, which was paid for by the Roman Catholic Church's Society of St. Vincent de Paul.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Dr. Pendola is buried in a marble family vault shaded by pine trees.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There is the surname Pendola, but there is no visible monument bearing birth or death dates, and no first name.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	There are no words of solace or affection, no religious symbols or biblical inscriptions, no mention of the fact that the deceased was a husband, a father and a practitioner of the healing arts.
Distant_Evaluation	For Dom Caruso, whose profound sadness over what happened that wintry night in 1927 extends to the Pendola family as well as his own, the primary concern remains how the outcome of the case must have affected the doctor's widow and daughter, even though he was never able to ascertain their fate.
Distant_Evaluation	''I doubt that poor Helen found any peace in her lifetime,'' Mr. Caruso said of the doctor's widow, who, according to Mr. Criss, died three decades ago.
Distant_Evaluation	''I hope and pray that Catherine did.
Distant_Evaluation	I'd like to believe that.''

Main	ABUJA, Sept. 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 64 communities in Kogi State of Nigeria's central region have been submerged following a flood disaster on Sept. 3 and 4, an official said on Thursday.
Cause_General	More than 150 households have been trapped by the flooding in Kotonkarfe neighborhood of the state, said James Ahmadu, a director of the Kogi Emergency Management Agency.
Cause_General	Ahmadu said five temporary camps have been set up for the victims.
Distant_Evaluation	"""This is a natural disaster but we (the emergency management agency) will do our best to respond as fast as we can to ensure that those people that are trapped are rescued,"" the official said."
Cause_General	He said people living in flood-prone areas in the state have been contacted to relocate to the upland.
Cause_General	Last week, Nigeria's Hydrological Services Agency issued a red alert on flooding in Kogi and six other states across Nigeria, citing increasingly high river levels.
Cause_General	At least three major dams have started releasing water as high flow from the upper catchment of the Niger basin continues to move downstream to Nigeria.
Cause_General	Earlier this year, heavy rains and thunderstorms caused havoc in Lagos, Nigeria's economic center and one of Africa's most populous cities.
Distant_Historical	Some of the worst flooding in recent memory happened five years ago in March 2012 when 32 of Nigeria's 36 states were affected, 24 severely.
Distant_Historical	More than 360 people were killed and almost 2 million people were displaced.

Main	LISBON, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- At least 21 women have been killed in Portugal since the beginning of 2018 in cases of domestic violence or violence in intimate relationships, more than the number of the whole of last year, according to the country's Observatory of Murdered Women on Thursday.
Main	Twenty-one women had been killed by their former or current partners or by their close family members by Sept. 12, the Union of Women for Alternatives and Answers (UMAR) said, citing figures gathered by its Observatory of Murdered Women.
Cause_General	Contrary to what has happened with the murder, in which there has been a decreasing trend, the numbers of femicide have remained constant, Elisabete Brasil, head of UMAR was quoted by Portuguese Lusa News Agency as saying.
Distant_Evaluation	"""It's still too early to talk about the total number, but we have already confirmed 21 women and this is brutal considering we are in September and we already have the same level of deaths from last year,"" she said."
Distant_Historical	Figures from last year's report of UMAR revealed that at least 20 women were killed in the cases of domestic violence.
Distant_Evaluation	Brasil said that levels of violence and the suffering inflicted on victims had also increased.
Distant_Evaluation	"She blamed the political figures and the general public for what she described as ""silence"" on the deaths caused by domestic violence."

Main	MEXICO CITY, Sept. 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexican authorities arrested a suspect believed to be involved in the slaying of journalist Mario Gomez in the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas, authorities said Monday.
Cause_General	According to a Chiapas prosecutor, the suspect was arrested in the course of investigation into the shooting death of Gomez, who was gunned down on Friday in the municipality of Yajalon.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"""A male suspect has been detained and in the coming hours there could be more arrests in this tragic event,"" the prosecutor's office said in a brief statement."
Cause_General	Gomez, 40, had a journalistic career that spanned more than a decade.
Cause_General	He worked as a correspondent for El Heraldo de Chiapas in Yajalon, which is located in the mountains in northern Chiapas.
Cause_General	According to local media reports, Gomez covered corruption, murders and civil complaints in Yajalon which is home to the indigenous Tzeltal.
Cause_Specific	Gomez died at a hospital moments after being shot by gunmen who fired six times from a motorcycle outside the victim's home, according to the prosecutor.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We have been able to determine his murder was connected to his work as a journalist,"" said Luis Alberto Sanchez, homicide prosecutor."
Distant_Evaluation	According to El Heraldo de Chiapas, the suspect in custody is an alleged drug trafficker in Yajalon who rides a motorcycle to get around.
Cause_General	This detail was not confirmed in the release.
Cause_General	Journalists continued to protest on Monday in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the state capital, to demand justice for Gomez, who once declared before the prosecutor that he had been the target of threats last year.
Distant_Evaluation	Organizations that defend the press said that Mexico was one of the most dangerous countries for journalists, with dozens murdered since the turn of the century.
Cause_General	Mexico's Ministry of the Interior has recorded 139 homicides of journalists in various states across the country from 2001 to June of this year.

Main	MANILA, Aug. 12 (Xinhua) -- Days of torrents of rainfall and flooding battered a widespread area in the Philippines, displacing nearly 383,000 people, a disaster agency said on Sunday.
Main	Based on the latest reports, a total of 88,000 families or 383,000 people from different places on the Philippine main Luzon Island were displaced due to the large-scale rainfall and flooding.
Cause_General	The Metro Manila and nearby Rizal province are the most affected places by the flooding.
Cause_Specific	And in the two areas, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said, about 40,000 people have been evacuated to safer grounds to avoid rising waters.
Cause_Specific	A major river in Marikina, a city in Metro Manila, swelled on Saturday night, forcing the local government to evacuate 3,783 families or 17,676 people living near the riverbanks to 19 government temporary shelters.
Cause_General	NDRRMC spokesman Edgar Posadas said no flood-related death has been reported as of Sunday.
Cause_General	Heavy rains continue to dump water in Luzon and some parts of the central Philippines this week.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"State weather bureau predicted that another tropical storm will continue to enhance the southwest monsoon that could bring ""scattered to widespread rains across the western section of Luzon until Monday."""
Cause_General	The NDRRMC raised the alert status to red at 8:00 a.m. Sunday as the agency closely monitor the relief efforts and assistance to affected communities.
Cause_General	The NDRRMC said more than 105 million pesos (about 1.97 million U.S. dollars) worth of assistance has been provided to the affected residents.
Distant_Evaluation	"""With the continuous rains expected to be experienced until Monday, residents in flood-prone and low-lying areas are advised to heed the call of their local government units regarding pre-emptive evacuation,"" the NDRRMC said in a statement."
Distant_Evaluation	"The agency urged the public ""to take necessary precautions"" and to be vigilant."
Distant_Evaluation	"""Everyone is advised to be mindful of emergency alerts and monitor weather updates."""
Cause_General	The Philippine Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque said in a separate statement that 762 of the 961 flooded areas have subsided.
Cause_General	The rest 199 areas are still flooded, he added.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We remind the public to be on alert,"" Roque said."
Main	MUTUAL fund managers are unfairly blamed for poor performance of their funds.
Main	The track record of the average manager doesn't lag that of a simple buy-and-hold strategy because the manager is an awful stock picker.
Main	Instead, the underperformance results from unprofitable transactions that are forced by the buy-and-sell decisions of shareholders.
Cause_Specific	This defense of the average fund manager comes from a new study called ''Does Motivation Matter When Assessing Trade Performance?
Cause_Specific	An Analysis of Mutual Funds.''
Cause_General	The authors of the study, which has been circulating as an academic working paper, are three finance professors: Gordon J. Alexander of the University of Minnesota and Scott Gibson and Gjergji Cici, both at the Mason Business School of the College of William and Mary.
Cause_General	A version is at papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=641743.
Cause_General	The professors' research builds on fund managers' motivations to buy or sell a stock.
Distant_Evaluation	The most obvious, of course, is that they believe that the stock they're buying will climb and that the stock they're selling will fall.
Distant_Evaluation	But only some trades purely reflect such convictions.
Distant_Evaluation	When investors are pouring money into the fund or selling in droves, managers have to buy or sell stocks that they would not have traded otherwise.
Cause_General	The study used a new method for segregating fund trades according to these different motivations, allowing the professors to measure managers' pure stock-picking abilities as well as the effects of fund inflows and outflows on fund performance.
Cause_General	The key to the approach was measuring how much money was being invested in a fund, or withdrawn from it, at the time of each transaction.
Distant_Evaluation	Consider a large purchase that a fund manager made during a period when investors were, on balance, withdrawing a lot of money from the fund.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The professors assumed that because the manager didn't have to buy the stock in order to invest a large inflow of cash, he must have believed that it would be an above-average performer -- a ''valuation-motivated buy,'' in the professors' parlance.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Similarly, a ''valuation-motivated sell'' would be a big sale that occurred when there was a large net inflow of cash into a fund.
Distant_Evaluation	The professors built two hypothetical portfolios, one for the valuation-motivated buys and the other for the valuation-motivated sells.
Distant_Evaluation	The portfolios changed composition every quarter.
Distant_Evaluation	From January 1980 through December 2003, the professors found, the first portfolio performed 2.8 percentage points a year better than the stock market as a whole, on average, while the second trailed the market by an average of 0.7 percentage point a year.
Cause_General	The study says this means that ''when fund managers make purely valuation-motivated trades, they beat the market by a substantial margin.''
Distant_Evaluation	Then there are the trades that are intended primarily to meet redemption requests or to put new cash to work in the market.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The professors assume that ''liquidity-motivated buys'' are those that occur when there is a large inflow of new cash, while ''liquidity-motivated sells'' occur amid a large number of redemption requests.
Distant_Evaluation	They acknowledge that some of these trades may be motivated by considerations other than liquidity.
Distant_Evaluation	But, they say, the average trade in their liquidity-motivated categories is less likely than that of the valuation-motivated groups to be a pure reflection of managers' beliefs about a stock's potential.
Distant_Evaluation	The professors built two portfolios of stocks in these liquidity-motivated categories, one for the buys and one for the sells.
Distant_Evaluation	The relative performance of the two liquidity portfolios was nearly opposite that of the valuation-motivated versions, with the buys now lagging the market and the sells outperforming it.
Distant_Evaluation	In fact, the liquidity-motivated sells outperformed the buys by two percentage points a year, on average.
Cause_General	In other words, the transactions that managers must make to meet liquidity needs eliminate much of the profit from trades made for valuation reasons.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Transaction costs, which were not included in the calculations, coupled with management fees, eliminate the rest of that profit for the average fund.
Cause_General	The professors interpret their findings to mean that mutual fund investors pay a high price for the chance to invest or withdraw money at any time.
Cause_General	And the cost is borne by all investors, whether or not they take advantage of the opportunity.
Distant_Evaluation	The investment implication is clear: don't pay for liquidity unless you need daily access to your money.
Distant_Evaluation	Are closed-end funds the preferred alternative for long-term investors?
Distant_Evaluation	It might appear that way.
Cause_General	After all, the amount of assets under management at closed-end funds doesn't change when investors buy or sell shares, because the number of shares outstanding is fixed.
Distant_Evaluation	This means the managers of closed-end funds are immune from rapid inflows and outflows of cash.
Distant_Evaluation	But Professor Gibson said in an interview that he did not think closed-end funds were the way to go.
Distant_Evaluation	Because the funds' assets under management don't change even when performance is awful, the closed-end fund industry ''helps entrench poor-performing managers,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	And because these funds won't receive new money even when performance is spectacular, he said, they tend to ''turn away the best managers who want to grow asset-based fees.''
Distant_Evaluation	Because of those considerations, Professor Gibson says he instead favors open-end mutual funds that significantly restrict short-term trades.
Distant_Evaluation	Such funds, he says, are more likely than closed-end funds to attract better managers and offer a powerful incentive for them to beat the market.
Distant_Evaluation	And because of the restrictions on short-term trades, long-term investors don't subsidize the liquidity needs of the short-term traders.
Distant_Evaluation	Professor Gibson says he particularly likes funds that charge redemption fees on short-term trades, especially when the fees go back into the fund.
Distant_Evaluation	It's easy to see why short-term traders don't like these fees, he said, but ''if you're a long-term investor, they are your best friend.''

Cause_General	Every day the line snakes down a spartan corridor on the eighth floor of City Hall here, as hundreds of people clutch a piece of paper inscribed with a fateful percentage that could force them to abandon their home.
Cause_General	The number is always over 50, and it means a house was so damaged in the flooding after Hurricane Katrina -- more than half-ruined -- that it faces demolition, unless the owner can come up with tens of thousands of dollars to raise it several feet above the ground and any future floodwaters.
Cause_General	But there is a way out, and that is why so many people stand in line every day, collectively transforming this battered city.
Main	''What you need to do is talk to a building inspector and get that lowered below 50 percent,'' a city worker calls out to the crowd.
Main	And at the end of the line, in a large open room down the hall, that is exactly what happens, nearly 90 percent of the time, New Orleans officials say.
Main_Consequence	By agreeing so often to these appeals -- more than 6,000 over the last few months -- city officials are in essence allowing random redevelopment to occur throughout the city, undermining a plan by Mayor C. Ray Nagin's rebuilding commission to hold off on building permits in damaged areas for several months until more careful planning can take place.
Distant_Evaluation	That plan, greeted by widespread opposition, including from the mayor himself, is now essentially dead.
Cause_General	House by house, in devastated neighborhoods across the city, homeowners are bringing back their new-minted building permits and rebuilding New Orleans.
Main	As many as 500 such permits are issued every day, said Greg Meffert, the city official in charge of the rebuilding process.
Distant_Evaluation	And there is no particular rhyme or reason to who gets a permit, or consideration of whether their neighborhoods can really support its previous residents.
Distant_Evaluation	One city building inspector, Devra Goldstein, called the proceedings on the eighth floor ''really fly-by-night, chaotic, Wild West, get-what-you-want.''
Distant_Evaluation	The floor, she said, represents ''a plan by default.''
Distant_Evaluation	It is also testament to the fierce desire of many displaced New Orleanians to re-establish themselves, no matter the odds.
Distant_Anecdotal	''They told us, if things look close, chances are we can get the assessment lowered below 50 percent, and we can start rebuilding,'' said George Aguillard, a 65-year-old retired longshoreman waiting patiently in the largely African-American crowd at City Hall.
Distant_Anecdotal	''At my age, there's no starting over in a new house,'' said Mr. Aguillard, a resident of the flooded Pontchartrain Park neighborhood.
Distant_Anecdotal	His damage assessment came in at 52.13 percent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	But there may be a steep price to the city's largess in allowing so many people to move back into flood plains without having to elevate their homes.
Distant_Evaluation	Past federal flood insurance directors say the practice violates the program, which established the 50-percent rule to guide safe building in flood-prone areas.
Distant_Evaluation	Most communities have adopted it as a minimum standard, say officials of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which runs the flood program.
Cause_General	In exchange for heavily-subsidized flood insurance for residents, the program expects cities to insist on flood-resistant construction.
Cause_General	Some cities that violate the flood rules have been ousted from the insurance program, putting thousands of residents at huge risk.
Distant_Evaluation	''They should be suspended, absolutely,'' said J. Robert Hunter, a former head of the federal flood-insurance program who is now director of insurance at the Consumer Federation of America.
Distant_Evaluation	''You can't fake it,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	''I sympathize with these people.
Distant_Evaluation	But you shouldn't say 'Well, you're poor, therefore you can build in a dangerous place where you can be flooded again, and killed.'
Distant_Evaluation	''
Distant_Evaluation	He added, ''You can't destroy the flood program to achieve a short-term goal.''
Distant_Evaluation	Another early director of federal flood insurance, George K. Bernstein, was equally critical, saying the practice of reducing flood damage percentages was ''just ripping off taxpayers.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''If New Orleans is phonying the damage reports so as to allow inadequate construction, they ought to get thrown out of the program,'' he said.
Cause_General	FEMA officials say they are keeping a close watch on New Orleans but consider the city to be following the rules.
Distant_Evaluation	''I understand they have a process in place,'' said Michael Buckley, deputy director for mitigation at FEMA.
Distant_Evaluation	''I wouldn't characterize it as a process to change the determination.''
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Buckley said he was ''not aware'' of any large-scale downsizing of damage assessments.
Cause_General	But up on the eighth floor, the downward revisions are over in a matter of minutes.
Distant_Anecdotal	''It was pretty smooth,'' said Charles Harris, an Orleans Parish sheriff's deputy who had four feet of water in his eastern New Orleans home, and whose percentage of damage was changed to 47 from 52.
Distant_Anecdotal	''They were really helpful.
Distant_Anecdotal	I thought it was going to be a combative thing.
Distant_Anecdotal	I was ready to put on my shield.
Distant_Anecdotal	It wasn't like that at all.''
Distant_Anecdotal	Kevin François, an air-conditioning repairman with a house that was rated as 52 percent damaged, said, ''It was basically an in-and-out process.''
Distant_Anecdotal	He, left City Hall with a number several points less than 50.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Meffert, the city official, said the initial assessments sometimes contained errors.
Main	Homeowners have to justify any changes to their damage assessments, he said, and must provide the details of their rebuilding plans.
Distant_Evaluation	''What's swinging the vote is, 'I'm going to do it this way,' '' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	But some leaving City Hall here are still in a pugnacious mood, despite the friendly reception.
Distant_Anecdotal	''I didn't give them a chance,'' Florestine Jalvia said proudly, having brought her assessment down to 47 percent damaged from 52.5 percent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A tougher stand on rebuilding would have probably engendered the same kind of reaction as the now-defunct four-month moratorium idea.
Distant_Evaluation	''I think the city is trying to avoid a major public fight,'' said Ms. Goldstein, the building inspector.
Cause_General	Out in the once-flooded neighborhoods, there is feverish activity, at intervals.
Distant_Evaluation	Those hard at work scoff at the commission's idea of holding off on rebuilding until it becomes clearer which areas have a chance of coming back.
Distant_Anecdotal	''I'm not listening to that, man,'' said Kristopher Winder, as he finished gutting his mother's house in the Gentilly neighborhood.
Distant_Anecdotal	He had brought it back down to its frame.
Cause_General	Down the street, signs in front of one house carry defiant messages: ''We're rebuilding, and don't try to stop us!''
Cause_General	reads one, and ''There's no place like home'' reads another.
Distant_Anecdotal	''I thought, when they said that four-month thing, I thought that was crazy,'' Mr. Winder said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''I was mad.
Distant_Anecdotal	I thought it didn't make no sense.''
Distant_Anecdotal	''I'm working on this house,'' he said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''She's going to be up and running in three to four months.''
Main	China's central bank said late Friday that it had raised the reserve requirement ratio for banks, the fourth increase in six months, to further tighten the nation's money supply.
Main	The modest move, which takes effect this month, increases the reserve ratio by half a percentage point, to 9.5 percent.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Analysts said it was the government's latest warning that too much money in the financial system could ignite inflation and perhaps fuel a stock market bubble.
Distant_Evaluation	''This is a warning shot,'' said Dong Tao, the chief economist for non-Japan Asia at Credit Suisse.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''If the stock market continues to go up, we might see further tightening.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Raising the amount of cash reserves that Chinese banks keep on hand with the central bank effectively restricts the amount of money that banks can lend.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While not being very restrictive, the central bank aims to curb excessive lending to new factories, real estate projects and road construction.
Cause_General	The move also comes as China's stock market is booming after several years in the doldrums.
Cause_General	Last year, the country's key index -- the Shanghai exchange -- rose 130 percent to close at 2,675, a record and the best performance of any major stock exchange in the world in 2006.
Cause_General	The market reached a 16-year high in December, as millions of investors who had been sitting on the sidelines in 2004 and 2005 jumped back into stocks.
Distant_Evaluation	Analysts say the government is determined to keep the economy expanding but is concerned about growing so quickly that the economy might crash before 2008, when Beijing is host to the Olympic Games, viewed as the ultimate coming-out party for China.
Distant_Evaluation	Overinvestment in real estate and construction has been among the chief worries for the government.
Cause_General	And for much of the last two years there have been frequent warnings and government measures to tame a wild property run.
Distant_Historical	The Central Bank said that last October, for the first time in five years, the bank savings of Chinese citizens decreased from the month before, presumably as more money went into the stock market.
Cause_General	Credit Suisse estimated that more than $30 billion in bank deposits have flowed into mutual funds or direct plays into the stock market over the last six weeks.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Many analysts say now that the bull run will continue in 2007, prompting even more money to flow into the market.
Cause_General	One Chinese mutual fund raised $5 billion in a single day recently before closing its doors to new investors, an astonishing achievement here, according to some economists.
Cause_General	Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which was publicly listed only last October, here in Shanghai and in Hong Kong, has already gained over 70 percent.
Cause_General	This week, prices shot up again, before falling sharply Friday.
Distant_Evaluation	The run-up means companies in China can once again raise money in the Chinese market rather than relying on the Hong Kong stock market.
Distant_Evaluation	But huge risks remain in a market that many analysts have long derided as a gambling den crowded with companies with suspect accounting.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Several economists say that more increases are expected in the coming months, to tame the economy and the stock market.
Distant_Evaluation	Hong Liang, a Hong Kong-based economist at Goldman Sachs, said that the government had used the reserve ratio as a policy tool to help manage the economy but that it had not been very effective in cooling things down.
Distant_Evaluation	She did not ''expect it to have much impact on the real economy or the financial markets.''
Cause_General	Large amounts of money flow into the country through foreign investments and surplus dollars from trade.
Cause_General	China also has a high savings rate.
Distant_Evaluation	So many people are looking to put that money to work -- in real estate, the stock market and even by investing in art and antiques.
Distant_Evaluation	''A lot of hot money has entered the market, legally and otherwise,'' said Chang Chun, a professor of finance at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, speaking of the stock market.
Distant_Evaluation	''In the past few years people were overpessimistic.
Distant_Evaluation	Right now, they are overoptimistic and they're bringing a lot of money into the market.''
Main	JUBA, May 25 (Xinhua) -- South Sudan's Meteorological Department has warned that several regions in the East African country are at risk of floods caused by torrential rains.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	The weather agency told reporters on Thursday that heavy rainfall is expected in the months of June, July and August (JJA) and may cause devastating floods in the flood-prone areas of Bahr el Ghazal, Upper Nile and Unity.
Distant_Evaluation	Samuel Thon, a Forecaster at the Meteorological Department, said the towns of Bor, Bentiu, Aweil, and Pibor are particularly at high risk of floods.
Distant_Evaluation	"""JJA (June, July and August) 2018 rainfall forecast indicates increased likelihood for flooding in the flood prone areas for example Bor, Bentiu, Aweil, Pibor and Upper Nile States plus other flood prone areas."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	"So we are expecting floods because the rainfall is much,"" Thon said."
Cause_General	According to South Sudan's Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Risk Management, several regions in the country are prone to recurrent floods every year in the rainy season, between May and October, which threatens the lives and livelihoods of thousands of people.
Distant_Historical	Last year, torrential rains forced over 100,000 people from their homes and destroyed valuable property in central and northern South Sudan.
Main_Consequence	The foot was balanced on a shopping bag after being scooped up off the dirty street by a man in a track suit.
Main_Consequence	There was no person to go with the limb.
Main_Consequence	Nearby a charred body was still smoldering, smoke coming off the black corpse 45 minutes after the attack.
Main_Consequence	For 50 yards, the dead were scattered about, some in pieces, some whole but badly burned.
Main	This violence on Thursday involved two bombs timed to go off one after another in the formerly upscale neighborhood of Mansour, which continues to be ripped apart by sectarian violence.
Main_Consequence	Thirteen people were killed and 22 wounded, just a small fraction of the civilians killed across the country this week.
Main	The first device went off at 10:15 a.m., probably a roadside bomb set on a timer, officials said.
Cause_Specific	The attack was apparently aimed at a gasoline station.
Cause_General	Cars were lined up around the block waiting for fuel, and dozens of people, grasping large plastic jugs, hoped to buy heating fuel.
Main	Just moments after the first explosion, a second, larger, car bomb detonated.
Cause_General	The neighborhood has traditionally been a mixed Sunni and Shiite one.
Distant_Evaluation	Although the Abu Jaffar gas station, where the attack was centered, is in what is considered a Sunni area, the method of the attack -- multiple bombs timed to explode in succession -- is usually thought of as a trademark of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a Sunni insurgent group.
Main_Consequence	An hour after the explosion, there was still a strong stench of burning gasoline and fire.
Main_Consequence	The road was slick with sludge from the water used to douse the fire.
Main_Consequence	Blood pooled in areas.
Main_Consequence	Scores of armed men were running about, including members of the Iraqi Army and the police.
Cause_General	Some of those with machine guns had no uniforms at all.
Cause_General	Shots rang out, mostly in warning.
Cause_General	Neighbors gathered outside, oddly calm and seemingly accustomed to such carnage.
Cause_General	A tanker truck filled with fuel was parked near the station, having escaped the blast.
Distant_Evaluation	Not surprisingly, residents living near the area blamed everyone from the government to the Americans to terrorists for what had happened.
Distant_Anecdotal	''We are just innocent people,'' said Nafia Abdul Jabbar.
Distant_Anecdotal	''The people killed were poor, in need of kerosene that they cannot afford to buy on the black market because the price is 10 times more than it is at the station.''
Cause_General	Elsewhere, a mortar attack was directed at the Shiite neighborhood of Huriya, wounding three people, officials said.
Cause_General	Clashes on the outskirts of the Sunni neighborhood of Ghazaliya left two people dead and 25 people wounded, Iraqi officials said.
Cause_General	A grenade attack in the Amin neighborhood killed five people.
Cause_General	Across the city on Thursday, officials said, 47 bodies were found mutilated -- 4 of them with their heads cut off.
Distant_Evaluation	An interview with the family of a man recently mutilated and killed, a prominent sheik considered to be the prince of the Tamim tribes, gives a glimpse into the complicated underworld that is, in part, responsible for the trucks full of bodies collected around this city every day.
Cause_General	The man, Sheik Hamid Mohammed al-Suhail, 75, was found Wednesday in the Shuala neighborhood of Baghdad, a Shiite redoubt, by members of his tribe, which is mixed Shiite and Sunni, who were searching for him.
Cause_General	He disappeared last Sunday, and his mutilated body was found wrapped in a blanket, covered in blood.
Cause_General	The search party recognized his body by the distinctive way the beard was trimmed.
Cause_General	He had been an outspoken critic of the sectarian fighting and participated in a recent conference in Cairo on national reconciliation.
Distant_Anecdotal	The kidnappers, whom his relatives hinted they knew but would describe only as ''militiamen'' for fear of reprisal, initially called his family asking for $100,000, said a nephew, Sheik Ali Sammi al-Suhail.
Distant_Anecdotal	The family told the kidnappers they did not have the money, the nephew said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''The body was mutilated in a brutal way,'' he said.
Distant_Anecdotal	''They used a drill on him and perhaps other tools.''
Distant_Anecdotal	One hand and one leg were almost completely severed.
Distant_Anecdotal	The nephew said he had been told by people who said they witnessed the killing that after his uncle was tortured, his body was thrown from a two-story building.
Distant_Anecdotal	He survived the fall but was brutalized further before finally being killed.
Cause_General	Another prominent Iraqi figure, Sheik Akram al-Zubeidi, was killed Thursday in Karbala, a Shiite holy city where there has been little sectarian strife.
Cause_General	Sheik Zubeidi was assassinated when he was stopped at a fake checkpoint, a local hospital official said.
Cause_General	Three other people in the car with him were also killed by the gunmen, whose motive was unclear.
Cause_General	There was continued fallout Thursday from the execution of Saddam Hussein, as Sunnis, from Kashmir to Libya, used his death as a rallying point.
Cause_General	The Libyan government announced that it would erect a statue of him to stand next to one of Libya's own national heroes, news agencies reported.
Cause_General	At least nine people were hurt in the Indian-controlled part of Kashmir when the police fired rubber-coated bullets to break up a large group of people protesting the execution, Reuters reported.
Cause_General	Two Iraqi officials involved in the investigation of the distribution of a graphic video of the hanging said Thursday that a second guard was being held for questioning.
Cause_General	Officials announced the arrest of the first guard on Wednesday.
Distant_Evaluation	There is increasing pressure, including from the White House, on the Iraqi government to proceed with caution in carrying out the execution of Mr. Hussein's two co-defendants, Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti, Mr. Hussein's half brother, and Awad al-Bandar, a former judge.
Distant_Evaluation	Despite the international reaction directed at the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, Mr. Maliki's popularity among Shiites in southern Iraq seems to have increased.
Cause_General	In Basra, Iraq's second largest city, hundreds of demonstrators representing Islamist parties rallied in the streets, praising Mr. Maliki and setting photos of Mr. Hussein on fire.
Error	THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ
Main	After months of speculation, the Simon Property Group on Tuesday finally made an unsolicited $10 billion offer for General Growth Properties, its bankrupt rival.
Main_Consequence	But General Growth quickly rebuffed the approach, calling the bid too low.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	If successful, the move would make Simon the biggest mall operator in the country, controlling about 30 percent of malls in the United States, according to analysts from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Merging the two companies, whose portfolios are roughly the same size, would also unite two of the most well-known names in the business.
Distant_Evaluation	In a letter sent to Simon late Tuesday, General Growth's chief executive, Adam Metz, said that he would welcome discussions within the confines of the bankruptcy process.
Distant_Evaluation	"""We and our board of directors have given considerable thought to your indication of interest and have concluded based on discussions with other interested parties that it is not sufficient to pre-empt the process we are undertaking to explore all avenues to emerge from Chapter 11 and maximize value for all the Company's stakeholders,"" Metz said."
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A merger would allow General Growth to finally remove itself from a 10-month, complicated Chapter 11 case.
Distant_Historical	Begun 56 years ago as a shopping center in Iowa, General Growth grew to be one of the nation's biggest mall companies, operating prized malls like the Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, only to run aground because of debt troubles after acquiring the Rouse Co. for $12.6 billion in 2004.
Distant_Evaluation	Simon is regarded by analysts as one of the best-managed mall operators in the business.
Cause_General	Over the last year, Simon has been building up its war chest to prepare for acquisitions to take advantage of depressed commercial real estate prices, with General Growth squarely in its sights.
Cause_General	It said on Tuesday that its offer would be largely financed by its cash on hand and existing credit agreements.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Simon's move is meant to pre-empt General Growth's own plan to emerge from bankruptcy, which may include financial help from another mall operator, Brookfield Asset Management, that owns some of its unsecured debt.
Cause_General	Simon is portraying its offer as speeding General Growth's exit from Chapter 11 by paying off $7 billion in unsecured debt in full and in cash and by assuming about $21 billion in secured debt.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Under the terms of its proposal, Simon would pay about $6 a share in cash.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	It would also distribute ownership in General's planned community development, valued at about $3 a share.

Main	BERLIN, Sept. 18 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi citizen who was named as a suspect during investigations into the widely publicized Chemnitz murder case in Germany has been released from police custody again, the Chemnitz State Prosecution Office told press on Tuesday.
Cause_Specific	A spokesperson for the prosecutors said that an arrest warrant issued earlier against the 22-year-old asylum seeker had been lifted due to a lack of evidence suggesting his direct involvement in a violent brawl in which a 35-year-old man suffered lethal injuries.
Cause_General	Although he was consequently no longer seen as the likely murderer of Daniel H., a German citizen and local resident of Chemnitz with Cuban roots, however, investigations into the suspect would continue.
Cause_Specific	According to his attorney Ulrich Dost-Roxin and an eyewitness questioned by police, the suspect stood several meters removed from the incident which took place three weeks ago.
Cause_General	Neither police nor state prosecutors have offered any detailed information on the exact events which led to the death of Daniel H. so far.
Cause_General	"All that is known is that the victim died from knife wounds sustained during the ""Chemnitz City Festival"" in which at least three asylum seekers are being treated as primary suspects."
Cause_General	The case sparked a series of widely-publicized far-right marches where some protestors chased and accosted foreign-looking civilians on the streets of the East German town.
Distant_Evaluation	"Dost-Roxin has publicly complained that the arrest warrant against his client included ""no evidence whatsoever"" to demonstrate his culpability."
Distant_Evaluation	The attorney criticized that the suspect should hence never have been remanded in custody and filed a legal request for the asylum seeker to be released again which has now been granted.
Distant_Evaluation	"Commenting on the latest development, Dost-Roxin described the original assertion that the Iraqi asylum seeker was involved in the killing as a ""fantasy of the state prosecution."""
Cause_General	Unlike the Iraqi citizen, a 23-year-old Syrian suspect will continue to be remanded in custody in connection to the murder of Daniel H. A further Iraqi citizen, who is also 22 years old and whose whereabouts are currently unknown, is still wanted by police as a suspect in the case.
Cause_Specific	The execution of Saddam Hussein was initially hailed as an example of democratic justice being served in Iraq, but leading members of Congress said Thursday that the conduct surrounding the hanging could undermine United States strategy in Iraq and complicate efforts to help the new Iraqi government succeed.
Cause_General	The White House has declined to criticize the execution, portions of which were shown online in a bootlegged video.
Distant_Evaluation	Several Republican senators who have been among President Bush's biggest supporters in the Iraq war said they were troubled by the video and fearful of the reverberations it could provoke.
Main	''It's a very bad thing, it's harmful, and I'm sorry that it happened,'' said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who has been a White House ally on its Iraq policy.
Main	''Obviously, it unnecessarily inflames the emotions of the Sunnis.''
Cause_General	While the White House says that Mr. Bush has not seen the video -- recorded without authorization with a cellphone camera -- several members of Congress said that they had seen it.
Distant_Evaluation	More important, they said, the rest of the world had, too.
Cause_General	As Mr. Bush inches closer to presenting his revised Iraq plan, Republican and Democratic lawmakers expressed dismay at the scene surrounding the final minutes of Mr. Hussein's life.
Main	They said it was another sign of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki's inability to deal with the sectarian divide in Iraq.
Main	''It is a very unfortunate episode, and they are still trying to sort out accountability,'' said Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia.
Main	''The key to success in Iraq -- whatever success we are able to achieve -- is reconciliation, and this certainly was not a helpful chapter in that.''
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Whether the execution ultimately has political repercussions beyond Iraq and here in the United States remains an open question.
Cause_Specific	But as senators prepared to be called to the White House as early as Friday for briefings about the president's Iraq plan, the video emerged as a new complication.
Cause_Specific	In the video, Mr. Hussein was shown standing with the noose around his neck at dawn last Saturday in Baghdad, facing a barrage of mockery and derision from unseen tormentors.
Cause_Specific	The images showed Mr. Hussein amid shouts of ''Go to hell!''
Cause_Specific	and ''Moktada!
Cause_Specific	Moktada!
Cause_Specific	Moktada!''
Cause_Specific	in reference to a radical Shiite cleric, Moktada al-Sadr.
Main	Speaking at the White House after a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany on Thursday, Mr. Bush said he had wished the execution had ''been done in a more dignified way.''
Cause_General	He said he appreciated that Mr. Maliki was investigating the way the execution was handled, but that he did not dwell on it during their video conference on Thursday.
Distant_Evaluation	Mr. Bush said Mr. Hussein had received a fair trial, the likes of which his enemies had not.
Distant_Evaluation	''He was given justice; the thousands of people he killed were not,'' Mr. Bush said.
Main	Senator Susan M. Collins, a Maine Republican, said she was troubled by the swiftness of the execution, adding that ''taunting someone who is about to be executed is just blatantly unacceptable.''
Main	The images contained in the video would almost certainly inflame sectarian tensions throughout the region, she said.
Main	''I have no grief for Saddam Hussein, but it makes it more difficult for Iraqi leaders to forge the political solution that I think is necessary to quell the violence,'' Ms. Collins said.
Main	''It threatens the very existence of the nation and thousands of Americans and Iraqi lives to have Saddam mocked before his execution.''
Distant_Evaluation	It was unclear whether the newly ascendant Democrats in Congress planned to make an issue of the handling of the execution.
Distant_Evaluation	It is not likely to be a part of promised Senate hearings on President Bush's Iraq policy, according to aides in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Cause_General	At the State Department, the official response has been that the execution, while imperfect, is in the past and that people should move on.
Main	But aides to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice continued to bemoan what one official called ''the idea that of all the people in that room, Saddam Hussein was the one who looked like he had the most dignity.''
Main	Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican, said the circumstances surrounding the execution were ''another factor that makes life more difficult for the Iraqi government as well as for our hopes for that government and stability.''
Main	But the video, he said, ''is by no means the most difficult issue we are facing in Iraq.''

Main	ABUJA, July 18 (Xinhua) -- Death toll has risen to 52 in Nigeria's northwestern state of Katsina where floods caused by heavy rain since last weekend wreaked havoc, a local official confirmed on Wednesday.
Cause_General	At least 24 people were wounded and hospitalized due to the incident that affected five villages in Jibia area of Katsina, said Aminu Waziri, head of the State Emergency Management Agency.
Cause_General	"""We have recovered 52 dead bodies from the five villages and we are still searching for 20 others,"" Waziri said."
Cause_General	"""Some of the victims were pulled from the rubbles of their collapsed homes."""
Cause_General	According to him, 24 of the victims were washed away to two villages in neighboring Niger.
Cause_General	More than 500 houses were destroyed by the flood, causing the displacement of at least 5,000 people, he said.
Cause_Specific	State governor Aminu Masari said following the heavy rainfall on Saturday, water from the main river in the area moved in a reverse direction and came back to Jibia town, causing the flooding.
Cause_General	Most of the victims have been relocated to a makeshift camp at a local school in the area, with the national relief agency providing support to victims.
Cause_General	Nigerian vice president Yemi Osinbajo visited the flood-hit area on Tuesday, saying the government would compensate the victims or rebuild their homes if necessary.
Cause_General	More than 40 people were reportedly killed and 200 houses destroyed by a recent flood in the northern state.
Cause_Specific	Stocks surged early yesterday, the first trading day of 2007, but fell sharply after minutes from a Federal Reserve meeting indicated that inflation remained the chief concern of policy makers even as they started to worry about a weakening economy.
Main	Markets closed mixed for the day.
Cause_General	The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down slightly, at 1,416.63, after being up 0.8 percent.
Cause_General	The Nasdaq composite index surged 1.6 percent early, but reversed course in the afternoon, falling 0.9 percent; it closed up 7.87 points, or 0.33 percent, at 2,423.16.
Cause_General	The Dow Jones industrial average also seesawed to a modest gain of 11.37 points, closing at 12,474.52.
Cause_General	Bonds were up slightly and the dollar rose against the euro and yen.
Distant_Evaluation	Like markets in Europe and Asia, American stock markets, which were closed Tuesday in observance of the day of mourning for President Gerald R. Ford, began the year on an upbeat note.
Distant_Evaluation	Investors were encouraged by Wal-Mart's posting of sales that were stronger than expected, and by a report showing an increase in manufacturing activity last month.
Cause_General	But the rally started to sag in early afternoon and collapsed shortly after the Fed released the minutes of its Dec. 12 meeting.
Cause_General	Energy stocks were among the biggest losers as crude oil futures fell by $2.73, to $58.32 a barrel, the first time they have closed below $60 since November.
Cause_Specific	The Fed, as it has done repeatedly in recent months, indicated in its minutes that while inflation had moderated, the central bank's policy makers were worried that it remained too high and that they might need to raise short-term interest rates.
Cause_Specific	The minutes noted, however, that one unnamed member of the policy-making committee wanted the Fed to acknowledge that it could also cut rates to reinvigorate the economy.
Distant_Evaluation	''It was a blunt reminder to the stock market that the Fed's going to err on the side of avoiding inflation,'' said Ethan S. Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers.
Distant_Historical	Stocks climbed steadily in the last six months of 2006, partly on the expectation that the Fed, which last raised interest rates in June, to 5.25 percent, would start cutting rates in the first half of 2007.
Distant_Evaluation	But some economists and market specialists have suggested that that view was inconsistent with investors' optimism that the economy and corporate profits would hold up well in the coming year.
Distant_Evaluation	''There is a sense in the stock market that you can have your cake and eat it too, that you can have good growth and rate cuts from the Fed,'' Mr. Harris said.
Cause_General	The bond and futures markets, by contrast, have become a little less hopeful in recent weeks about interest rate cuts, and are now priced with the expectation that the Fed's first rate cut will come in late June.
Cause_General	Yields on the 10-year Treasury note, which move in the opposite direction of the price, have risen to 4.66 percent, from a low of 4.02 percent at the start of December.
Cause_General	Bond prices and yields were little changed in yesterday's trading after the Fed's announcement.
Distant_Evaluation	''The bond market got the reaction to the Fed minutes right,'' said Joseph Biondo, a senior portfolio manager at Biondo Investment Advisors, ''and the stock market didn't.''
Distant_Evaluation	Still, market specialists said the stocks' late-afternoon recovery suggested that investors were not as moved by the Fed as it first seemed.
Cause_General	Also, the energy sector was responsible for much of the decline in stock prices -- the S.& P. Energy index fell 3.7 percent for the day.
Distant_Evaluation	Analysts said warmer-than-expected temperatures on the East Coast helped drive down prices for crude oil and other commodities.
Distant_Evaluation	Another concern for the markets is the possibility that profit growth will slow.
Distant_Evaluation	Companies will start reporting results for the fourth quarter later this month and, for the first time in four and a half years, profits may not post double-digit gains, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist for S.& P.'s Equity Research Service.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	He said he expected stocks to register a gain in 2007, but that the markets might first experience a correction typically seen late in an economic expansion.
Distant_Evaluation	''There is a healthy level of skepticism that is coming back into equity valuations,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	The next few days could prove critical, specialists note, citing a market truism that the markets' performance in the first five trading days of a year is a harbinger of their performance in the coming 12 months.
Distant_Evaluation	While it is too early to draw those broader conclusions, the market did appear to start off on a new footing.
Distant_Historical	Toward the end of last year, volatility, a measure of the sharpness of the stock market's movements, fell to historic lows.
Distant_Evaluation	''Volatility is back,'' said Jeffrey N. Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC Advisors.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	''That's maybe the story for 2007.
Distant_Evaluation	We have not seen it for a while.
Distant_Evaluation	At this point in prior business cycles, we saw volatility spike back up.''
Cause_General	Following are the results of yesterday's auction for four-week Treasury bills:

Distant_Evaluation	IF 2006 proved anything, it's that aging bull markets don't have to die simply because they're old, or that they must quietly fade away.
Distant_Evaluation	Given enough of a dose of economic growth, corporate profits and cheap capital, a bull market that's more than four years old -- as this one is -- can still rage on like a young buck.
Distant_Evaluation	That was certainly what mutual fund investors discovered last year.
Cause_General	Emboldened by an economy that proved resilient in the face of Federal Reserve interest-rate increases, high oil prices and a cooling housing market, the average general domestic stock fund gained 12.8 percent last year.
Cause_General	Among all stock funds that invest in domestic equities, including single-sector portfolios, the average gain was even better: 13.4 percent, according to Morningstar, the mutual fund tracker.
Cause_General	To be sure, this was shy of the return of 15.8 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-index of blue-chip stocks, which had its best year since 2003.
Distant_Historical	But it was a surprising improvement from 2005, when domestic stock funds gained 7.7 percent, on average, and looked to be tiring.
Main	Many people on Wall Street say the market's momentum could last well into this year.
Distant_Evaluation	And in at least one respect, history is on the market's side.
Cause_General	Since 1945, the S.& P. 500 has never declined in the third year of a presidential term, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P. And the average gain for equities during these years has been 18 percent.
Cause_General	As has been the case throughout this decade, the equity markets caught a much-needed second wind in the fourth quarter, which drove the Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000 index of small stocks to record levels late last year.
Cause_General	According to Morningstar, the average domestic stock fund surged 6.9 percent in the quarter, marking the sixth consecutive year-end rally for stocks.
Distant_Evaluation	What propelled stock prices higher this time?
Distant_Evaluation	For starters, data released late in the year ''put to rest all the extraneous worries about the economy,'' said James Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston.
Distant_Historical	In the spring, concerns that the Federal Reserve may have done too good of a job of slowing the economy threatened to tame the bull market.
Distant_Historical	In fact, a growing number of economists began to worry about the possibility of a recession on the horizon.
Distant_Historical	As a result, stocks ran into a proverbial wall of worry in the spring and early summer.
Distant_Historical	From May 5 to June 13, the S.& P. 500 slumped 7.7 percent, its worst slide since the bear market earlier this decade.
Distant_Historical	For the entire second quarter, the average domestic stock fund lost 2.8 percent.
Distant_Evaluation	But as it turned out, the economy -- and consumers, for that matter -- proved stronger than expected.
Distant_Historical	Moreover, oil prices stabilized and the Fed all but said that it was done raising short-term interest rates for now.
Distant_Evaluation	''Once investors were no longer worried about recession, they were willing to jump back on the risk train,'' said Thomas W. McDowell, chief executive and chief investment officer at Rice Hall James, an investment management firm in San Diego.
Distant_Evaluation	He's not kidding.
Distant_Evaluation	In the fourth quarter, investors, whom many analysts thought would embrace relatively conservative assets like blue-chip domestic stocks, went back to their speculative ways.
Distant_Evaluation	AND they were rewarded handsomely for their risk taking.
Cause_General	Within the fixed-income world, for example, the average emerging-market bond fund rose 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 11.1 percent for the year.
Cause_General	High-yield bond funds did nearly as well, posting quarterly gains of 4.2 percent and annual returns of 10.3 percent.
Cause_General	By comparison, the average bond fund that invests in long-term debt issued by the United States government rose just 0.1 percent in the quarter and 0.6 percent for the year.
Cause_General	The picture was much the same in the equity markets.
Cause_General	The average diversified emerging-market stock fund, for example, soared 17.4 percent in the quarter and finished the year up 32.6 percent, according to Morningstar.
Cause_General	The best-performing fund category was Latin American stock portfolios, which posted gains of 21.5 percent for the quarter and 45.2 percent for 2006.
Cause_General	On the domestic front, many of the same sectors that have been leading the markets in recent years dominated again in 2006.
Cause_General	Precious-metals funds, for instance, rallied 32.2 percent for the year and are now up 33.7 percent, annualized, over the last five years.
Cause_General	Real estate and utilities portfolios also soared, posting average gains last year of 34 percent and 25.5 percent, respectively.
Cause_General	And thanks in part to the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions, financial sector funds rose 16.4 percent, on average.
Cause_General	Despite predictions that this would be the year when large-cap domestic stock funds returned to dominance, small-cap stock funds again led the domestic markets among general domestic stock funds.
Cause_General	According to Morningstar, the average small-cap growth fund advanced 11.1 percent last year, versus 7.3 percent for the average large-cap growth portfolio.
Cause_General	And while large-cap value funds outperformed their small-cap counterparts for the full year, they trailed small-cap value funds in the fourth quarter.
Distant_Evaluation	''This appetite for risk has me a little worried,'' Mr. Swanson said.
Distant_Evaluation	He asserted that investors aren't simply expecting a so-called soft landing in the economy -- in other words, the avoidance of a recession.
Distant_Evaluation	''The market is bracing for the plane to circle and take off again -- and I think that's too optimistic,'' he said.
Distant_Evaluation	Another reason that speculative investments are doing so well is that despite 17 interest-rate increases since June 2004, ample liquidity continues to slosh around the global financial markets.
Distant_Evaluation	''Right now, there's still too much money chasing too few financial assets,'' said Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management.
Distant_Evaluation	James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, agreed.
Cause_General	''This is the only time in postwar history where a recovery has taken place without any rise in long-term borrowing costs,'' he said.
Cause_General	He noted that yields on 10-year Treasury notes were virtually unchanged from June 2004, when the Fed began its tightening cycle in an effort to slow the economy and tame inflation.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Until this changes, Mr. Paulsen argues that the markets will continue to be led by small-cap stocks that are economically cyclical.
Distant_Evaluation	He is in the minority.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	A vast majority of money managers and market strategists are banking that investors will regain interest in large-cap stocks as attention turns to the slowing economy and corporate profit growth later in the year.
Cause_Specific	Indeed, a recent survey of money managers by the Russell Investment Group showed that investors were more bullish on large-cap growth and large-cap value stocks than they were on small-cap growth and small-cap value shares.
Cause_Specific	And in general, investors are anticipating a fifth consecutive positive year for equities.
Distant_Evaluation	Yet bull markets rarely survive to this age.
Cause_General	In fact, of the last 14 bull markets in domestic equities, only four lasted five years or longer.
Cause_General	And the average bull lived only 3.7 years, according to InvesTech Research.
Cause_Specific	According to the Russell survey, 8 in 10 investors believe that domestic stocks will have another positive year in 2007.
Cause_Specific	And a third are predicting gains of at least 10 percent, in part because of a slowing-but-still growing economy and a possible rate cut by the Federal Reserve.
Distant_Evaluation	But all of this bullishness has some market watchers nervous.
Distant_Evaluation	''There's certainly less pessimism today about 2007 that there was a year ago,'' Mr. Paulsen said.
Distant_Evaluation	While that may be good news for investor confidence, he added, ''it means the risks in the market are higher.''
Distant_Evaluation	FOR instance, what if corporate profit growth -- estimated at 15.5 percent last year, versus 13.7 percent in 2005 -- slows more than expected?
Distant_Historical	Mr. Schweitzer points out that six months ago, Wall Street analysts were expecting corporate profits among S.& P. 500 companies to jump 10.5 to 10.75 percent in 2007.
Cause_General	''Now, the latest forecasts are for growth of a little more than 9 percent,'' he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	While this is none too shabby, ''the ebbing of corporate profit growth expectations may continue in 2007 and unsettle investors,'' he said.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	At the very least, Mr. Schweitzer said, the worrisome degree of optimism among investors means that ''the chances of a bumpy ride on Wall Street are quite high.''
Error	MUTUAL FUNDS REPORT
Main	Harriet E. Miers, President Bush's longtime confidante and onetime Supreme Court nominee, has resigned as White House counsel, officials said Thursday.
Cause_General	Tony Snow, the White House spokesman, said that Mr. Bush had accepted Ms. Miers's resignation ''reluctantly'' and that she had tendered it after deciding she was ready for a change after six years in the job.
Main_Consequence	The White House said that a search for a successor was under way and that Ms. Miers would remain at her post through this month.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Ms. Miers's departure comes as the White House girds for possible confrontations with Congressional Democrats, who have promised oversight investigations into White House policies, including energy, the war in Iraq and national security.
Distant_Evaluation	The White House counsel's office would be central in attempts to stave off subpoenas and requests for sensitive information.
Distant_Historical	Even before the Democratic victories in November, Republicans close to the White House speculated that it would seek to beef up the counsel's office.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Mr.
Distant_Expectations_Consequences	Snow said Ms. Miers's departure was not the beginning of another round of changes in the West Wing.
Distant_Evaluation	''For those who are speculating about any others within the White House proper, I am aware of none and expect none,'' Mr.
Distant_Evaluation	Snow said.
Cause_General	Still, her announced resignation came with Mr. Bush poised to name a new director of national intelligence, J. Michael McConnell, a retired Navy vice admiral and director of the National Security Agency from 1992 to 1996, and move his current director, John D. Negroponte, to the State Department as its second in command.
Distant_Historical	Rumors of Ms. Miers's departure date back to the White House shake-up last spring, when Joshua B. Bolten became Mr. Bush's chief of staff and undertook a review of all personnel.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Bolten was said at the time to have raised the possibility of moving Ms. Miers out of the counsel's office, though White House officials denied it.
Cause_Specific	Mr.
Cause_Specific	Snow said her decision to resign did come after a series of meetings with Mr. Bolten.
Cause_General	''She's been here for six years,'' Mr.
Cause_General	Snow said.
Distant_Evaluation	''It's hard duty.''
Distant_Historical	Ms. Miers has worked with Mr. Bush since his days as Texas governor and has grown close to him and the first lady, Laura Bush.
Distant_Historical	Ms. Miers started at the White House as staff secretary after the 2000 campaign and became a deputy chief of staff before moving to the White House counsel's office.
Distant_Historical	Mr. Bush's decision to nominate her to the Supreme Court in 2005 provoked the ire of liberals and conservatives, who criticized her as a Bush crony who did not have the legal intellectual credentials or résumé the job required.
Distant_Historical	She withdrew her name from consideration but returned to Mr. Bush's inner circle and remained one of his closest advisers.
Distant_Evaluation	In her resignation letter, Ms. Miers said her own role in helping Mr. Bush choose nominees for the federal bench was ''among the most rewarding of my experiences.''
