0,Drug lab,"The state’s highest court has ruled that judges have the authorÂity to stay the sentences of so-called Dookhan defendants who are seeking new trials, upholding the legal framework created to review hundreds of cases tied to the state drug lab scandal."
0,Drug lab,"In a decision issued Monday, the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that the ''exceptional circumstances’' surrounding convictions tied to Annie Dookhan, the former state chemist who allegedly falsified suspected drug samples, gave Superior Court judges the power to free defendants who are challenging their convictions."
0,Drug lab,"''The allegations of misÂconduct at the Hinton drug lab have given rise to serious concerns about defendants who may be incarcerated as a consequence of tainted convictions,'' the ruling stated."
0,Drug lab,"''Thus, a defendant’s motion to stay the execution of his sentence should be decided in an expeditious manner.''"
1,Drug lab,"While largely procedural, the decision highlighted the swirl of legal questions surrounding Dookhan-related cases, which have flooded the judicial system and led to the release of hundreds of defendants, more than 300 from state prisons and more from county facilities."
5,Drug lab,"Last fall, Essex County prosecutors contested motions to stay sentences in more than 50 cases involving allegedly tainted drug evidence, contending that the judge lacked the authority to stay sentences in the absence of a pending appeal."
0,Drug lab,"The court disagreed, saying ''the interest of justice is not served by the continued imprisonment of a defendant who may be entitled to a new trial.''"
0,Drug lab,"''The magnitude of the allegations of serious and far-reaching misconduct by Dookhan at the Hinton drug lab cannot be overstated,'' the ruling stated."
0,Drug lab,''The alleged misconduct may have compromised thousands of Âcases.''
2,Drug lab,Dookhan faces a host of criminal charges related to misÂhandling or falsifying drug evidence.
2,Drug lab,She has pleaded not guilty.
1,Drug lab,"Matthew Segal, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said the decision marked a ''complete Ârejection’' of prosecutors’ attempt to challenge the system set up to handle the Dookhan cases."
1,Drug lab,"''It said the exact procedure being used is fine,'' he said."
1,Drug lab,"The court went a step further, Segal said, in indicating that Dookhan’s involvement in cases may be enough to warrant a new trial."
8,Drug lab,"''My hope is that courts will look at this opinion and see reasons for granting new trials,'' he said."
1,Drug lab,''You can’t rest a conviction on fraud.''
1,Drug lab,"Jonathan W. Blodgett, the ÂEssex district attorney, said the decision clarified legal and procedural questions around the special drug lab sessions, reducing the chances of further litigation."
1,Drug lab,"''Our overriding concern was the possibility of relitigating Dookhan drug lab cases for a third time,'' he said in a statement."
1,Drug lab,''This would have stretched the already limited Âresources of all the district attorney’s offices.''
8,Drug lab,"Michael O’Keefe, district Âattorney for the Cape and ÂIslands, said the decision would help prosecutors handle the host of legal challenges arising from the scandal, which officials have estimated could affect well over 100,000 cases."
1,Drug lab,"''As district attorneys, our goal is to expedite the cases as quickly as possible,'' said O’Keefe, president of the state association of district attorneys."
1,Drug lab,"''In that Âregard, it’s helpful to know what the rules are.''"
3,Drug lab,"In a separate section of the ruling, the court said that special magistrates who were appointed by the Superior Court to preside over the drug lab sessions are not authorized to stay a sentence."
3,Drug lab,"But the magistrates, who by March had conducted more than 900 hearings on Dookhan-related cases, can make ''conclusions of law’' for judges to review, as they have been doing."
3,Drug lab,The court also ruled that magistrates cannot overrule a Superior Court judge’s decision to stay a sentence.
1,Drug lab,"Anne Goldbach, forensic services director in the state public defender’s office, said the decision upholds the status quo."
1,Drug lab,"''It says that the process set up to handle these cases is a valid one,'' she said."
3,Drug lab,"The court’s decision focused on a case involving a Lynn man, Shubar Charles, who in 2010 pleaded guilty to cocaine possession with intent to distribute."
5,Drug lab,He was sentenced to four to seven years in state prison.
5,Drug lab,"Last December, he filed a Âmotion to stay the execution of his sentence, noting that Dookhan was the primary chemist on the case."
5,Drug lab,"The motion was granted, and prosecutors Âappealed."
3,Drug lab,"A second case involved ÂHector Milette, who in 2011 pleaded guilty to cocaine trafficking."
5,Drug lab,"In November, a judge Âdenied his motion for a stayed sentence, but a special magistrate overturned the decision in February."
5,Drug lab,"Prosecutors appealed, and he was sent back into custody."
5,Drug lab,"He later pleaded guilty, admitting the substance was cocaine despite Dookhan’s involvement, prosecutors said."

5,Convicted killer stabbed to death,It’s the same charge Seeber pleaded guilty to in 2000 for her role in the death of 91-year-old Ruth Witter in a robbery gone awry.
1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,Both the attorney who defended Seeber for more than a decade and the prosecutor who sought to put her behind bars said Seeber’s death appears to be the final chapter in a life that all too often centered around abusive relationships.
1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,The criminal case against Seeber was one of the lengthiest and most unusual legal sagas Saratoga County has ever seen.
5,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"Allegations surfaced that a veteran police investigator who committed suicide had mishandled evidence, a retrial was ordered and the case ultimately ended with a rarely used plea deal."
1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"''It was probably one of the most complex cases we’ve seen, procedurally,'' said Saratoga County District Attorney James A. Murphy III, who took over as district attorney the year before Witter was killed."
7,Convicted killer stabbed to death,Murphy said prosecutors in Queens called him about Seeber’s death late Wednesday night.
1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"''It’s sad, especially in her context, but I can’t say I was surprised,'' Murphy said."

3,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"In addition to murder, Sanchez was also charged with criminal possession of a weapon, evidence tampering and resisting arrest."
3,Convicted killer stabbed to death,The parole program that oversaw Seeber’s release helped her find housing in Queens.
8,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"John Cuilla, the recently retired Saratoga County public defender who represented Seeber since 2000, said Seeber planned on moving to Washington to live with her brother."
1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"''It’s a tragic ending,'' Cuilla said."
1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,''It appears that she just could not get out of that cycle of domestic violence.''
5,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"Seeber was raised in Rexburg, Idaho, a predominantly Mormon city of 17,000 on the eastern edge of the state."
1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"There, Cuilla said, Seeber’s parents’ troubled marriage first exposed her to domestic violence."
5,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"A once-promising student who aspired to a career in the military, Seeber moved to the Capital Region in 1998."

5,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"Though she was killed in Colonie, the case ended up in Murphy’s hands because the couple crossed into Saratoga County to dispose of the body."
5,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"After prosecutors said Seeber unknowingly led detectives to Witter’s body, both Seeber, then 18, and Hampshire, then 19, were charged with murder."
5,Convicted killer stabbed to death,Seeber pleaded guilty.
5,Convicted killer stabbed to death,Hampshire went to trial and was acquitted.
5,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"Hampshire, however, was already facing an unrelated burglary charge and would later be arrested for multiple felonies, including helping cover up a fatal hit-and-run crash."

1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,He said he was dismayed that it appeared she had recently fallen into another abusive relationship with Sanchez.
1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,''I thought she was ready to come out and be a productive member of society.''

8,Convicted killer stabbed to death,Murphy noted that not all victims of domestic violence end up as violent offenders themselves.
1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,He also said he and Witter’s family still view Seeber as a killer.
1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"''Ruth was a very elderly woman who was having her great granddaughter and a friend over for a visit, not to be robbed and killed,'' Murphy said."
1,Convicted killer stabbed to death,"''(Witter’s family) looked upon her as a cold and calculated person who manipulated her great grandmother to try and steal jewelry and money, and if she had to sacrifice (Witter’s) life to get those things that was how it was going to go.''"

1,Boys' parents sought asylum,''They felt that their kids’ lives were in danger from the (U.S.) government.''
8,Boys' parents sought asylum,"He said the couple also believed that if Cuba rejected them, they would have time to seek protection at other foreign governments’ embassies in Havana."
1,Boys' parents sought asylum,The couple’s dreams of a safe haven abroad were short-lived.
3,Boys' parents sought asylum,"Within days of the Hakkens’ arrival at Hemingway Marina outside Havana, Cuban authorities gave the U.S. permission to apprehend the family and extradite them to Florida."
3,Boys' parents sought asylum,Both parents are jailed as they await trial in Hillsborough Circuit Court on charges including kidnapping and child abuse.
1,Boys' parents sought asylum,But the description of the Hakkens’ overtures to Cuban officials and fears of government intrusion in their boys’ lives provides an early glimpse of their mind-set and legal strategy.
3,Boys' parents sought asylum,"Camareno’s remarks to the Tampa Bay Times, made after Joshua and Sharyn Hakken briefly appeared in court Monday, marked the first time the couple’s own account of their motives has emerged."
8,Boys' parents sought asylum,The argument that the Hakkens were attempting to extricate their sons from a tyrannical child welfare system also promises to bring more national attention to the bizarre saga of an American family driven by mistrust of government to seek refuge in the Western Hemisphere’s last communist country.
3,Boys' parents sought asylum,"On April 3, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, Joshua Hakken, 35, kidnapped his children at gunpoint from the home of his mother-in-law, whom he bound with zip-ties."

5,Boys' parents sought asylum,"The children were placed in foster care following the drug arrest, but Hakken showed up with a gun at their foster home demanding they be returned, according to authorities."
5,Boys' parents sought asylum,The foster parents called 911 and Hakken fled.
3,Boys' parents sought asylum,"After the Hakkens’ extradition from Cuba, their sons were placed back in the custody of their grandmother, who lives north of Tampa."
3,Boys' parents sought asylum,"Camareno said he and Jorge Chalela, Joshua Hakken’s attorney, are awaiting discovery materials from the Hillsborough State Attorney’s Office and are still in the early stages of reviewing the case."
8,Boys' parents sought asylum,"But Camareno already expects to call witnesses from Cuba, and he said the case could involve international law and jurisdictional issues."
1,Boys' parents sought asylum,It is unclear what specific justification the Hakkens might have had for claiming special refugee status.
3,Boys' parents sought asylum,"Cuba never signed the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention, the backbone of international protection for asylum-seekers."
3,Boys' parents sought asylum,"The treaty obligates governments to harbor those who fear persecution in their home countries for their political views, race or religion, among other factors."
1,Boys' parents sought asylum,"''They weren’t too sure of what type of asylum they were seeking,'' Camareno said, ''but they were seeking asylum.''"

0,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"But Bloomberg, in a lawsuit filed Thursday in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, said the courts had long held that registration of contracts was “not a vehicle for the comptroller to usurp the mayor’s authority to enter into contracts.”"
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"The lawsuit, believed to be only the second filed by the Bloomberg administration against the city or state comptroller’s office, is the latest and perhaps most pronounced skirmish between Bloomberg and Liu, a Democrat who is now running for mayor."
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,Administration officials contend that there is a discrepancy between the reasons Liu cites in his news releases for rejecting a contract and the public documents explaining the reasons.
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"Liu, the city contends, typically asks for more technical information, then registers those contracts with few if any changes and no public notification."
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"“It’s a joke,” Marc La Vorgna, Bloomberg’s press secretary, said of Liu."
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,“Sad part is this is taxpayer resources and dollars being completely wasted on naked political ambitions.
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"He was running for mayor the second he stepped into this job and had no interest in doing the job he was sworn in to do, only to abuse the position.”"
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"Aides to Liu argue that the comptroller needs to highlight certain Bloomberg proposals because the mayor has mishandled contracts, like those for the CityTime payroll project and for an overhaul of the 911 system."
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"“Under Mayor Bloomberg, spending on outside contractors has ballooned, and his outsourcing philosophy is out of control,” said Stephanie Hoo, a spokeswoman for the comptroller."
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"“In all cases, whenever this office has questioned contracts, it has been within the guidelines of the City Charter and our mandate to protect taxpayers from wasteful spending.”"
3,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"In the rare cases where a mayor or a comptroller sues the other over contracts, the courts have held that comptrollers have extremely limited powers."
5,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"In 2006, the Court of Appeals rejected former Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr.'s effort to void a contract on Snapple, writing that “the Charter establishes in plain language that the mayor and the corporation counsel - not the comptroller - bear the burden of determining that procedural requirements have been met and legal authority exists to award a concession contract.” (Thompson ran against Bloomberg in 2009 and is again seeking the Democratic nomination for mayor.)"
3,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"Under the charter, the only basis for a comptroller to scuttle a contract is evidence of possible corruption in the contracting process."
3,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"In rejecting the shelter contracts, Liu mentioned not corruption, but concerns over inspections and certificates of occupancy."
3,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"Bloomberg administration officials cited more than a half-dozen instances in recent years in which Liu publicized a rejection of a contract, then quietly registered it."
5,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"In March 2011, for example, Liu rejected a $20 million deal on teacher recruitment, saying the timing was “curious at best” because of Bloomberg’s threat to fire teachers."
5,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,But the reasons for rejecting the contract pertained to data input and an incomplete insurance certificate.
5,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"Liu registered the contract that July, with minimal changes."
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"When asked about the discrepancies between press statements and public documents, Hoo did not directly address the issue, but rather alluded to the mayor’s maneuver to run for a third term in 2009."
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"“It is beyond ironic that Mayor Bloomberg’s Law Department is up in arms about adherence to the City Charter when no one in the history of New York City has shown such deep disrespect for the City Charter,” she said."
1,NEW YORK MAYOR SUES COMPTROLLER ON CONTRACTS,"“If we’d followed the charter, he wouldn’t even be in office right now.”"

0,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,LONDON - Britain’s security agencies appeared headed for a period of deeply uncomfortable scrutiny after the government said Sunday that it had been aware for more than two years that one of the two men suspected of hacking an off-duty British soldier to death on a London street had ties to al-Qaida.
0,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed that the ministry had provided “consular assistance” in Kenya in 2010 to the man, Michael Adebolajo, 28, a British citizen of Nigerian descent."
5,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"He had been arrested by the Kenyan police on suspicion of planning to join al-Shabab, an extremist group in Somalia that Britain has classified as a terrorist organization."
3,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"Adebolajo and the other suspect in the London attack - Michael Adebowale, 22, also of Nigerian origin - have been under armed police guard in separate London hospitals since the attack Wednesday."
2,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"The soldier - Lee Rigby, 25 - was run down by a car on the sidewalk outside an army barracks, then attacked with meat cleavers."
3,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,Police officers arriving on the scene shot and wounded the two suspects.
1,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"The grisly brutality of the attack shocked Britain as few events have since the bombings on the London transit system on July 7, 2005, which killed 52 passengers and the four bombers."
3,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,Sunday newspaper headlines about the case focused on what the government knew about Adebolajo and Adebowale and why no action was taken that might have prevented Rigby’s death.
1,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"In a statement on Sunday, the Foreign Office spokesman sought to tamp down the controversy, saying that the office’s role in the events in Kenya in November 2010 was limited to consular assistance to Adebolajo, “as normal for British nationals.” It did not address the Kenyan government’s statements that Adebolajo, using a false name, had been arrested near the Somali border with five Kenyan nationals while carrying al-Shabab literature."
3,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"The statement also did not address a claim made on BBC television on Friday night that Adebolajo spoke of rebuffing an attempt by MI5, the British domestic security agency, to recruit him."
3,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"The claim was made by Ibrahim Hassan, a man who says he has links to Islamic extremist groups."
3,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,Hassan said Adebolajo had told him that the recruitment attempt was made after he was deported from Kenya.
1,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,British security officials quoted in the Sunday newspapers said that efforts to recruit Islamic extremists in such circumstances were common.
3,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"Hassan himself was arrested in the BBC studio immediately after the interview by Scotland Yard counterterrorism detectives, who said that the arrest was not connected to the killing of Rigby."
8,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,Hassan’s claims and his arrest added to a growing sense that inquiries into Rigby’s death are likely to delve into the murky world of the security agencies and their dealings with Islamic extremists.
8,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"A Parliamentary panel, the Intelligence and Security Committee, has said it expects to receive a preliminary report from the government on the attack this week."
1,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,Among the issues that the panel’s leading members have said they want to explore is whether MI5’s desire to penetrate groups with suspected terrorist ties had led to decisions not to prosecute people like Adebolajo under laws that bar Britons from engaging with terrorist organizations overseas.
1,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,Security officials have said that MI5 viewed Adebolajo as posing a “low risk” of potential terrorism and did think he needed close monitoring.
3,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"Security officials have also confirmed that Adebolajo, and to a more limited extent Adebowale, had been known to British security officials for several years because they took part in protests in Britain that were organized by extremist groups, some of which involved violent clashes with the police."
1,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,Newspapers in Britain have carried accounts saying that Adebolajo had been heard in mosques and community centers in south London calling for jihadist attacks in Britain.
1,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"Muslim community groups have condemned the killing of Rigby in unequivocal terms, and say that many British Muslims are deeply apprehensive over a number of incidents of hostile graffiti and invective since his death, despite appeals for calm from Prime Minister David Cameron, the archbishop of Canterbury, the Most Rev."
1,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"Justin Welby, and other prominent figures."
8,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"Tensions may rise further this week, when post-mortem details on Rigby are expected to be made public."
8,OFFICIALS KNEW SUSPECT IN SOLDIER'S DEATH HAD TIES TO AL-QAIDA,"The report may shed light on several aspects of the brutal attack that have seized public attention, including whether he was still alive after the car hit him, and whether he was beheaded, as some witnesses say."

1,"Aetna, seeking antitrust nod, sells Medicare drug business to WellCare","The $69 billion CVS-Aetna deal would be the second large deal this year between insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, a consolidation the companies say will help rein in rising U.S. healthcare costs."
8,"Aetna, seeking antitrust nod, sells Medicare drug business to WellCare",CVS said separately that it expects the Aetna acquisition to close in the early part of the fourth quarter of this year.
3,"Aetna, seeking antitrust nod, sells Medicare drug business to WellCare","Rival insurer Cigna Corp’s (CI.N) $52 billion acquisition of Express Scripts Holding Co (ESRX.O), the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, which was announced after the CVS-Aetna transaction, has already passed U.S. Justice Department scrutiny."

8,"Aetna, seeking antitrust nod, sells Medicare drug business to WellCare","The sale price is likely between $1 billion and $1.5 billion based on the number of members, BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch estimated in a research note."

3,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"IN the five years since the last farm bill was passed, the number of farmers' markets in this country has grown to nearly 4,500 from 2,750, gladdening the hearts of foodies who like nothing better than seeing locally grown Chioggia beets, butter radishes, Early Girl tomatoes, miniature pattypan squash, chervil, fresh goat cheese logs and duck breast in a conveniently located market."
1,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"Some of the best customers of farmers' markets, though, haven't been free-spending foodies, but food-aid recipients."
0,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"Happily, the new farm bill before Congress has several proposals to vastly increase food aid to the poor, including two programs that allow them to buy at farmers' markets."
1,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,That normally would be great for small farmers.
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"Without the guaranteed income from the farm bill's $15 million Seniors Farmers' Market Nutrition Program and the separate $25 million Farmers' Market Nutrition Program (part of the food aid program for families known as WIC), some small growers would be out of business, and many others would be reluctant to sell in low-income neighborhoods where fresh produce is otherwise a rarity -- ''food deserts.''"
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"But, it turns out, new efforts to encourage food-aid recipients to eat more fruits and vegetables -- which are calamitously underrepresented in American diets -- could end up shutting out the small farmers who are the backbone of these markets."
0,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"The Agriculture Department has proposed rules that would reallocate WIC benefits now restricted to eggs and dairy products, which have long enjoyed the muscle of well-financed lobbies, to fruits and vegetables, which haven't."
3,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,Millions of children would be entitled to $6 a month for produce.
0,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"And in its initial proposals for the new farm bill, the Bush administration suggested making available $200 million, starting next year, to buy fruits and vegetables for the poor."
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"If such suggestions get approved, hundreds of millions more dollars could be spent every year on fresh produce."
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"There's a big catch, though: small farmers might not reap the windfall."
3,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"Over the past 15 years, most states have switched from paper coupons for food stamps to debit cards, removing the stigma of redemption at the checkout counter."
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"The WIC program, which still uses paper, will most likely do the same."
1,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"Most farmers, of course, don't take plastic -- and, market managers say, they have seen their sales plummet with the switch from paper."
1,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,The need for farmers to enter the cashless economy is obvious.
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,Wireless card readers will benefit both people on food assistance and foodies who (like me) don't carry all the cash they end up eager to spend.
1,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"But who will pay for the machines, which can cost as much as $1,500 and incur steep monthly service fees, not to mention workers trained to use them?"
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"Without card readers, farmers fear they will lose the bulk of the farm bill help they get now, and be shut out of those new hundreds of millions."
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,The proposals at the Agriculture Department and in the farm bill would let food-aid recipients buy fruits and vegetables wherever they can find them.
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,That means supermarkets -- which remain the most convenient place to buy produce.
1,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,Farmers' market advocates are alarmed.
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"The money will go to the centralized industrial farms that supply supermarkets, they say -- the ones that crush small farmers and waste fuel."
1,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"So: Help small farmers and the places dedicated to selling truly local food, or help the sharply increasing number of people struggling to feed themselves and their families?"
1,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"The most equitable way to help farmer's markets may be to urge legislators to support good programs already in the farm bill, like the Farmers' Market Promotion Program and Community Food Projects."
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"These could equip farmers with card readers, an essential first step, and finance other ingenious projects to help small farmers thrive."
1,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,Concerned cooks (and everyone else) should urge increases for education programs that tell people how and where to use food stamps.
3,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"Only 56 percent of people eligible for food stamps get them, and most of those recipients don't know that the stamps can be used at farmers' markets."
1,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,A reason often given for the great success of the WIC farmers' market program is the nutrition education that comes with it.
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"Yes, supermarkets may well get the great majority of increased benefits for fresh produce."
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,But a small slice of a much larger pie could amount to as much as or more money than farmers' markets now get from food-assistance programs.
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"And the new money available for fruit and vegetables would mean that ''specialty crops'' -- the kind we actually think of as food, as opposed to crops like corn, soy and cotton that get the much criticized multibillion-dollar commodity subsidies -- would finally get support from the farm bill."
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"More people would eat healthier diets, and farmers might start growing even better-tasting varieties, confident of finding a market."
8,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"Many other programs proposed for the farm bill could bring locally grown food to places that want and need it, like schools and hospitals."
1,Less Green at the Farmers’ Market,"But farmers' markets are where the bill can best serve cooks -- a frequently well-financed, always opinionated special-interest group that should start acting like one."

0,Clear Channel Board Rejects Sweetened Offer From Bidder,"Clear Channel Communications, the nation's largest radio broadcaster, said last night that its board had rejected a revised offer by two equity firms that had agreed to buy the company, but are now trying to keep the deal from falling through."
8,Clear Channel Board Rejects Sweetened Offer From Bidder,"The new offer was a last ditch attempt to save the deal from being voted down by shareholders next week, but now means the buyout is almost certain to be rejected."
2,Clear Channel Board Rejects Sweetened Offer From Bidder,Clear Channel said that the two firms -- Bain Capital Partners and Thomas H. Lee Partners -- had proposed increasing their bid from $39 a share to $39.20 and allowing shareholders to own a stake once the company goes private.
2,Clear Channel Board Rejects Sweetened Offer From Bidder,That would allow shareholders to participate in any profit from a sale or initial offering in several years.
2,Clear Channel Board Rejects Sweetened Offer From Bidder,The buyout firms had offered shareholders up to 30 percent of the company after it became private.
2,Clear Channel Board Rejects Sweetened Offer From Bidder,"The proposal came just days after Institutional Shareholder Services, the influential proxy advisory firm, recommended that shareholders reject the $39 a share bid, effectively killing the deal."
3,Clear Channel Board Rejects Sweetened Offer From Bidder,"Before making the latest proposal, Bain and Thomas H. Lee consulted Highfields Capital Management, one of Clear Channel's biggest shareholders that had planned to vote against the deal, according to people involved in the talks."
1,Clear Channel Board Rejects Sweetened Offer From Bidder,"Highfields had agreed to vote in favor of the deal, these people said."
2,Clear Channel Board Rejects Sweetened Offer From Bidder,"But, Clear Channel said last night that in determining to reject the proposal, ''significant shareholders of the company have privately or publicly made known their opposition to the merger at $39 per share and their lack of interest in stub equity,'' referring to the stake that shareholders could have kept under the plan."
3,Clear Channel Board Rejects Sweetened Offer From Bidder,Stub equity was recently introduced to shareholders in the United States as a way to placate shareholders who had watched new owners of buyouts reap large profits by flipping the companies a few years later.

3,Clear Channel Board Rejects Sweetened Offer From Bidder,"Under the terms of the latest proposal, the buyout firms would have financed the 20 cent a share increase by having the Mays family, which founded Clear Channel, receive $37.60 a share, which was the price the company had originally accepted last November before the buyout firms raised their offer to $39 a share in a failed attempt to appease shareholders."

1,Dell revisits IPO option amid tracking stock deal pushback -sources,"However, the hedge funds have said that Dell’s offer shortchanges them because it inflates its own value and discounts the value of the tracking stock."

8,Dell revisits IPO option amid tracking stock deal pushback -sources,"Whether tracking stock shareholders would be better off under that scenario, as opposed to selling to Dell now, would hinge on the performance of the IPO and the timing of a subsequent takeout."

0,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"A public pension fund in Louisiana has sued the directors of Caremark Rx, contending that their unanimous backing of the company's $21 billion merger with CVS over a rival $26 billion bid from Express Scripts improperly benefits Caremark executives at the expense of shareholders."
2,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"Among the benefits Caremark executives and directors will receive if the CVS deal goes through, the fund's lawsuit contends, are positions at the combined company and indemnification from penalties and fines that may result when criminal and regulatory investigations into possible stock option backdating by Caremark officials are concluded."
3,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"Yesterday, Express Scripts filed suit to block the CVS deal, arguing that the terms deal supported by the Caremark board prevents its directors from executing their fiduciary duties to shareholders."
7,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"The lawsuits, filed in Delaware Chancery Court, will once again bring the fiduciary duties of directors in the post-Enron world to the forefront."
3,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,Delaware is where most major United States companies are incorporated.
5,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"Caremark accepted the CVS bid on Nov. 1, even though the stock-for-stock deal offered no premium to Caremark's market price at the time."
8,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,Caremark's directors have recommended that company shareholders approve the deal at a meeting that is expected to occur before March 16.
1,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"On Monday, Caremark rejected the $26 billion bid made on Dec. 18 by Express Scripts, saying that it would ''result in a highly leveraged and weakened business'' if it was approved by shareholders."
3,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,The Express Scripts offer of $58.50 a share is approximately 15 percent higher than the CVS bid.
2,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,The lawsuit filed by the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System contends that the CVS deal is unfair to Caremark shareholders not only because its price is significantly below the rival bid.
2,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"The pension fund's lawyers also argue that Caremark directors improperly accepted deal protection provisions in the CVS bid that act to deter other bidders, effectively making the deal a fait accompli even before the shareholders vote."
2,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"First, there is the $675 million breakup fee to be paid by Caremark in cash to CVS, if the target walks away."
2,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"Then, there is a so-called last-look provision, which gives CVS the chance to come back and top any rival bid."
8,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"''Any potential third-party bidders will be loath to invest the time and resources necessary to pursue a superior bid while knowing full well that CVS retains control of the bidding,'' the pension fund's lawsuit says."
1,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"The Louisiana fund accuses the Caremark board of supporting the deal to benefit Edwin M. Crawford, the company's chief executive, and other executives."
2,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"Under the terms of the deal, nine Caremark executives will join the combined company and Mr. Crawford will become chairman of its board and receive an estimated $48 million in exit pay."
8,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"While he would probably receive a similar amount if Caremark sold out to Express Scripts, Mr. Crawford might not be asked to join the combined company under the terms of such a deal."
3,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"The Louisiana pension fund also noted that the CVS deal guarantees a job at the merged company for Mr. Crawford's son, Andrew."
5,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,A Caremark proxy filed last year described the younger Mr. Crawford as senior vice president for industry analysis and underwriting.
2,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,The merger with CVS would also allow an unspecified number of Caremark directors -- perhaps all of them -- to get lucrative seats on the combined company's board.
2,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"In its offer, CVS has also agreed to cover any costs associated with stock option backdating at Caremark, practices that are under federal investigation and the subject of another civil suit filed against the company in Tennessee."
3,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,That lawsuit has challenged 4.6 million options granted to Mr. Crawford as having been possibly backdated.
3,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"Stock sales covered by those options generated $262 million for Mr. Crawford, the Tennessee lawsuit contends."
1,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"''The inequities could not be more apparent,'' said Gerald H. Silk, a lawyer at Bernstein, Litowitz, Berger & Grossmann, one of the firms representing the Louisiana fund."
1,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"''Shareholders get a coercive, zero-premium deal while Crawford gets a $48 million payout, jobs for himself and his son and complete indemnification for his alleged option backdating transgressions.''"
8,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,A Caremark spokesman called the pension fund's lawsuit meritless and said the company would defend against it vigorously.
1,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"As for the Express Scripts suit, he said it was a ''frivolous'' attempt to interfere with the CVS merger."
1,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"''Contrary to allegations made by Express Scripts, the provisions of the CVS merger agreement are lawful and appropriate,'' the spokesman said."
1,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"To be sure, many of the terms in the CVS bid for Caremark -- the no-shop provisions and last-look opportunity -- are common in the merger world."
3,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"But the suit filed in Delaware, comes at a time when directors' actions as fiduciaries for their shareholders are under increased scrutiny."
8,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"As a result, the case, which is being heard by Chancellor William B. Chandler III, provides an opportunity for him to opine on the matter of directors' duties broadly and whether the Caremark directors exercised those obligations in particular."
1,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"This is familiar territory for Chancellor Chandler, who oversaw the Disney case of 2005."
5,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,In that case he chastised the company's directors for essentially rubberstamping a contract struck by Michael D. Eisner with Michael S. Ovitz that resulted in a $140 million severance payout after Mr. Ovitz was terminated a short time later.
3,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"Chancellor Chandler has asked for a hearing on the issues before Caremark's shareholders vote on the CVS bid, now scheduled to take place in mid-March."
1,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"In a Dec. 29 meeting with the parties in the case, Chancellor Chandler said that while he was certain Caremark would argue forcefully that its directors exercised their duties of care and loyalty to the company's owners, he also concluded that ''there is a tenable argument on the other side, and nonfrivolous claims here on the other side, that at least need to be tested against a fuller record.''"
2,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"Correction: January 12, 2007, Friday An article in Business Day yesterday about a lawsuit filed by a pension fund over the proposed merger between Caremark RX and CVS misstated the amount of exit pay that Caremark's chief executive, Edwin M. Crawford, would receive if a rival bid was accepted."
2,A Public Pension Fund Sues Directors of Caremark Rx,"If Express Scripts succeeds in its rival bid, Mr. Crawford would receive $57.6 million to $62.4 million, not an estimated $48 million."

1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,Hedge funds have been very good to institutions like Yale.
5,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"On its 2005 tax forms, the university reported annual income of $149 million from its hedge fund investments."
5,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"And much of that income, which would have been taxable if derived from domestic hedge funds, was tax free because it was generated by offshore affiliates of such funds."
2,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"That strategy of tax avoidance is one that many of the nation's wealthiest universities, as well as foundations and pension funds, have been using with great success."
0,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,Now Congress is considering closing the loophole that allows it.
8,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,The goal is to raise money for the Treasury.
2,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has been looking into hedge fund practices, estimates that more than $100 billion in tax revenue a year is lost through the use of offshore tax havens and questionable tax shelters by investors of all types."
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"''A key concern is whether tax-exempt use of offshore corporations to invest in hedge funds is accelerating the shifting of U.S. assets offshore to avoid U.S. taxes,'' said Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the subcommittee and who is among the sponsors of legislation that would close a number of such loopholes."
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"While nonprofit institutions are generally exempt from taxation, income produced by business activity that is deemed outside the scope of their mission may be subject to tax."
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"Under the tax code, profits from any activities financed with borrowed money, like much of the income from hedge fund and private equity investments, are taxable."
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"But if the nonprofit invests in an offshore company, there is no tax."
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,So hedge funds and private equity funds have set up offshore subsidiaries for nonprofits and other tax-exempt groups like pension funds to invest in.
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"For instance, Farallon Capital Institutional Partners L.P. of San Francisco, a hedge fund in which Yale, the University of Michigan and other universities have invested, has a management company in the British Virgin Islands."
5,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"The offshore company was created in large part to help nonprofits avoid taxes, Thomas F. Steyer, Farallon's senior managing partner, wrote investors in a letter in 2000."
5,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"A 2005 article in the newsletter Tax Notes said Duke University sought to keep 25 percent of its endowment, which now stands at $7.4 billion, invested in hedge funds."
5,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"At the time, about 75 percent of Duke's hedge fund investments were in offshore funds, according to the article, written by Maximilian H. Haag, a Duke law student who had interviewed the university's investment managers."
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"But universities do not generally disclose what portion of their endowment is invested in offshore hedge funds, and so it is impossible to estimate how much tax they are avoiding."
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,And their officials are wary of discussing the issue.
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,Spokesmen for 10 of the nation's wealthiest universities either did not respond to a reporter's messages or declined to make anyone from their investment management teams available.
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"''As a matter of policy, we do not comment on our portfolio,'' Cass Ciatt, a spokeswoman for Princeton, wrote in an e-mail message."
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"David Jarmul, a spokesman for Duke, emphasized the university's support for research, its financial aid programs and the other benefits its endowment provides."
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"The university invests ''in various ways to maximize returns,'' Mr. Jarmul said by e-mail."
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"''Like other universities, Duke uses legitimate tax-advantaged structures, always in accordance with applicable law.''"
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"With growing signs of displeasure from Congress, however, there are indications that some universities are reconsidering the use of offshore entities as a tax-avoidance method."
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"''This practice is legal and has been approved by the Internal Revenue Service in a number of rulings,'' said Patrick Dunkley, senior counsel at Stanford University, whose endowment stood at $14.1 billion in 2006."
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,''We are nonetheless currently reviewing the investment strategy.''
5,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,Congress made a pass at closing the loophole in 1993.
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"''I can tell you why I proposed it in one word: revenue,'' said former Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, who was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee from 1981 to 1994."
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,''That's the same thing driving them now.''
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"Mr. Rostenkowski said that under ''pay as you go'' budget rules, which Congress adopted anew in January, ''you have to raise the revenue to feed this appetite we have for spending money.''"
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"In some cases, hedge fund investors can realize returns as high as 40 percent or more."
8,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"So while closing the loophole could mean additional taxes for nonprofits, it would be unlikely to reduce their investments in hedge funds and private equity funds significantly, said Leon M. Metzger, a former hedge fund executive who teaches hedge fund management at New York University."
8,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"''Because returns are so very attractive, unless Congress takes an extreme approach, I don't think this will have a major impact,'' Mr. Metzger said."
4,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"In addition, two hedge fund partners who spoke only on condition of anonymity, for fear of alienating clients, said nonprofits could probably use other investment strategies to avoid taxes."
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"Foundations also use the loophole, although the nation's largest, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, had no hedge fund investments at the end of last year."
3,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"Richard Tofel, the Rockefeller Foundation's general counsel, said 21 percent of its $3.7 billion endowment was invested in hedge funds and 12 percent in private equity funds."
8,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"Mr. Tofel said he did not know what portion of those investments were offshore, but Rockefeller expects to pay $7 million in income taxes for 2006."
8,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,He also said Rockefeller would be unlikely to end all its offshore investments if the law changed.
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"''Tax is part of what goes into the mix in making investment decisions,'' Mr. Tofel said, ''but on the other hand it's not the principal thing that drives investment decisions."
1,Nonprofits Face Threat to a Tax Loophole,"You make judgments about underlying asset values, risk and reward, and taxes come in somewhere after that.''"

3,Swedes head to polls in 2018 general elections - Xinhua,They have vowed to be tougher on immigration than any other political party in Sweden and want the Scandinavian nation to leave the European Union.
2,Swedes head to polls in 2018 general elections - Xinhua,"In other recent polls, the Sweden Democrats have scored between around 16 and 25 percent, which would signify a significant boost compared to their 2014 election result, when they gained nearly 13 percent of the vote."

0,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,Egyptian officials are hoping to add powers to the Constitution that would allow the president to more easily dissolve Parliament and give him free rein to suspend civil liberties and imprison anyone deemed a terrorist threat.
0,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"The Egyptian public will be asked to vote Monday on a package of 34 amendments to the Constitution that the government says represent political reform, in part by making it easier for opposition candidates to run for president."
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,But political opposition and international human rights groups say the package appears more an effort by the governing party to secure its monopoly on power and give constitutional legitimacy to police powers that have long been criticized as excessive and undemocratic.
3,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,The sharpest debate has been over three areas of proposed change.
3,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,One would ultimately allow broad powers to monitor and detain people accused of terrorist activities while not specifically defining terrorism.
3,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"Another would limit the role of judges in monitoring elections, which are often mired in accusations of fraud."
3,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,And a third would prohibit the creation of any religious political parties.
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"''There is one political regime, and one ruling party with a monopoly over power and wealth, and it wants to give the false impression that there is an ongoing process of political reform,'' said Hassan Nafaa, a political scientist at Cairo University."
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"''In reality, it is an assertion of the control of the ruling party.''"
8,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"The government, however, says the amendments would allow true reform because they would also redistribute powers among the president, the government and Parliament."
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"Parliament, for example, could with a two-thirds vote cause the collapse of the government."
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"But the president would have the power to dissolve Parliament without first asking for a public referendum, as current law requires."
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"The amendments were debated for months in Parliament, then emerged largely unchanged from what had been proposed by the government and the governing party of President Hosni Mubarak."
3,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"The State Information Service, the public relations arm of the government, plans to publish a summary of the amendments in every newspaper over three days, starting Saturday -- just two days before the polls open."

3,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"The election had been planned for the first week of April, but it was moved to Monday in a late night vote a week ago in Parliament."

1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"''We are trying to guarantee maximum integrity of the process, not the outcome of the process.''"
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"Opposition groups, including the popular Muslim Brotherhood, have urged a boycott of the election."
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,With little doubt about the outcome -- no referendum has failed in modern Egypt -- Amnesty International said in a statement that the proposals represented ''the greatest erosion of human rights in 26 years.''
8,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"In equally harsh language, it charged that the antiterrorism provisions would ''simply entrench the long-standing system of abuse'' in place since the adoption of emergency laws after President Anwar el-Sadat was assassinated in 1981."
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"The government strongly objected to Amnesty International's assessment, and Mr. Kaffas said antiterrorism laws, while necessary, were often unpopular, including the Patriot Act in the United States."
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,But anxiety permeated the ranks of the governing party as well.
8,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"Abdel Moneim Said, a member of the governing National Democratic Party and director of Egypt's premier research center, the government-financed Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo, acknowledged concerns over aspects of the changes that could permit ''an abuse of power.''"
8,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,But he said the changes could also push the country toward reform.
8,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"''I think it is the accumulation of little additions here and there that can generate change eventually,'' he said."
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,The move is occurring at a time when the government is showing less tolerance for criticism and political opposition.
3,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"It has jailed opposition critics, including a member of Parliament and a former presidential candidate; it delayed local council elections by two years; it sentenced a blogger who had criticized the president to four years in prison; it has had troops fire on would-be voters to keep them away from the polls; and it has cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood, arresting members and freezing assets."
3,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,The Brotherhood is a banned but tolerated organization that has won wide public support by offering a network of social services throughout the country.
8,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"While the crackdown and the amendments would inhibit the Brotherhood's political activities, the group said it would do little to shut down the grassroots operations it has used to build support."
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,''We can we do?''
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"said Muhammad Habib, deputy leader of the Brotherhood."
8,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,''There is not much we can do except increase our activity and our reach to the people.''
3,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"Egypt receives about $1.7 billion a year in American military and development aid, and at one time was held up by the White House as the vanguard for Democratic changes in the region."
3,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"But the Bush administration's pressure on Mr. Mubarak to enact such changes has evaporated as it has increasingly sought help in dealing with Iran, Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process."
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"The United States has been tentative in its comments on the referendum, with the State Department initially saying it was an internal matter for Egypt and the secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, later telling reporters it was ''disappointing.''"
1,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"At a news conference in Aswan on Saturday morning with the United Nations secretary general, Egypt's foreign minister, Ahmed Aboul Gheit sharply rejected Ms. Rice's remarks, saying, ''This is our own development, our own country.''"
8,Egypt to Vote on Expanding Powers of the Presidency,"In a televised speech later, Mr. Mubarak insisted that Egypt would never bend to foreign ''pressure, dictation or prerequisites.''"

1,Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,"“Creating trust in politics takes time, creating trust in European politics takes more time, but creating trust in European politics when you’re French takes even more time,” the 31-year old soft-spoken lawmaker told Reuters in an interview."
0,Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,"Macron, who paints next May’s European elections as a battle between progressive, pro-EU reformists and populist, far-right nationalists, is out to break the old left-right duopoly that has dominated European politics in recent decades."
7,Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,"He has tasked Anglade with seeking out future alliance partners from the existing conservative European People’s Party (EPP) and center-left Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), as well as the smaller centrist ALDE group, to form a new movement inside the European Parliament."
1,Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,"“We see the system as dysfunctional and it needs rebuilding, but there’s no arrogance in our approach, we’re not here to say we’ll destroy everything because we’re the best.”"
8,Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,"For all the professed humility, Macron is attempting nothing less than a brutal reshaping of the current political order in Brussels, just as he achieved in France, and a direct challenge to Europe’s most powerful leader, Germany’s Angela Merkel."
8,Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,"Merkel and Macron have forged a strong relationship, Anglade said, dismissing the suggestion Macron’s election strategy may put him on a collision course with the German chancellor, who is keeping faith with the EPP."

8,Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,"“But if we want to become the number one force, or a major force in the European parliament, we need to go beyond the ALDE base and be able to rally political parties which were once in the EPP, the Socialists or the Greens, in a new structure.”"
1,Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,"“There are a certain number of parties which went to the EPP or the Socialists at one point, not because they were conservatives or Socialists, but because that’s where power was and how you got posts,” Anglade said."
3,Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,Macron has not designated a leader for his European ambitions and in another challenge to Brussels has said he will not present a “spitzenkandidat” - a group’s candidate to become the head of the European Commission.
1,Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,"“The spitzenkandidat today is a man or a woman named by a political party in a dark room in Helsinki, Riga or wherever, who has no strong legitimacy,” Anglade said."
8,Killing them softly: Macron's EU election man challenges Brussels political order,"Macron will seek businessmen, professionals and political novices to run for parliament on his party’s national ticket, just as he did in France last year, Anglade said."

0,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and President Jalal Talabani announced Monday that they plan to introduce a proposal that would allow thousands more former members of Saddam Hussein's Baath Party to serve in the government.
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"The plan, if it were to gain approval, would be an important step toward reconciling Iraq's warring Shiites, who lead the government now, and Sunnis, who dominated the Hussein government."
2,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"The announcement by the prime minister's office came just hours after the outgoing American ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, gave his final news conference in which he repeatedly emphasized that the Iraqi government's slowness to change the draconian de-Baathification laws, among others, had contributed to American skepticism about Iraq's commitment to finding a political solution to the sectarian strife troubling the country."
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"The lack of movement had also hampered efforts at reconciliation between the Sunnis and Shiites, he said, since the Sunnis have had little faith that the Shiite government would do anything concrete to help them."
5,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,Changing the de-Baathification laws was one of the political goals for the Iraqi government set by the Bush administration six months ago.
0,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"Under the proposal by the prime minister and the president, which comes on the heels of meetings held between Mr. Maliki and Sunni insurgent leaders and appears to be an effort to back up his outreach with action, all Baathists would be able to collect their pensions."
0,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"In addition, thousands more former Baathists would be allowed to hold government jobs than under the current law."
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,Former Baathists who return to government work would have to sign a pledge that they would refrain from making political statements about the current government.
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,The law would also set a three-month time limit for Iraqi citizens who have complaints against former Baathists to bring a claim.
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,Then the courts would have six months to rule.
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,Any claims brought subsequently would be thrown out.
8,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"The goal of the new law is to take a step toward reconciling Sunnis and Shiites, said Dr. Sadiq al-Raqadi, a political adviser to Mr. Maliki."
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"''The reason for the new law is that the government wants to finish these cases; they want to close the files of the Baathists,'' he said."
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,''This is an effort to find a solution for the problem of the Baathists.''
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"The Iraqi government's move, one of several aspects of reconciliation, comes not a moment too soon in Mr. Khalilzad's view."
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"''To sustain U.S. support, things have to move at a certain pace,'' Mr. Khalilzad said."
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"And, time is running out, he said."
2,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"The United States House of Representatives voted last week to begin withdrawing troops by the fall of 2008, and the Senate plans to consider a less restrictive plan, though it is unclear what the final outcome of the legislative effort will be."
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"Mr. Khalilzad served for 21 months in Iraq, during the drafting of the country's Constitution as well as the second nationwide election and a referendum approving the Constitution."
8,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"If, as expected, the United States Senate approves his nomination, he will become the American ambassador to the United Nations."
8,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"He will be replaced by Ryan Crocker, a career diplomat, who is currently the ambassador to Pakistan."
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"The Iraqi government's move to modify the de-Baathification law, if it goes through, would be a victory for Mr. Khalilzad who pushed hard to bring Sunnis back into the government."
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"Recently, American diplomats and military officials along with Iraqi government officials, including Mr. Maliki, have reached out to Sunni militants in an effort to woo those elements of the insurgency whom Mr. Khalilzad described as ''reconcilable insurgents'' and isolate the most violent elements."
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"''There is a real struggle going on in the Sunni Arab part of Iraq between those of Al Qaeda and the other more patriotic groups who want a successful Iraq, an Iraq in which everyone's rights is respected,'' said Mr. Khalilzad."
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,Most of these ''patriotic groups'' were linked to Mr. Hussein's former government rather than to the Sunni religious militants with ties to Al Qaeda.
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"Mr. Khalilzad underscored that there would be no discussions with individuals linked to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the insurgent group that claims ties to the Qaeda organization, which has been associated with some of the most destructive attacks in Iraq."
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"Mr. Khalilzad noted that in the six weeks since the American-backed security plan began, attacks had dropped 25 percent."
1,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,Baghdad seemed relatively quiet on Monday.
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,There were several improvised explosive devices that killed one Iraqi civilian and one policeman.
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,Fifteen unidentified bodies were found.
4,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"National Public Radio on Monday reported an episode on Saturday in which gunmen opened fire on children playing soccer in Baghdad, followed by a battle between Sunni and Shiite neighbors."
4,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,The details could not be verified on Monday.
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"In Hilla, south of Baghdad, three Sunni mosques were attacked, apparently in retribution for an attack on a Shiite mosque three days earlier."
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"In Iskandariya, American and Iraqi forces were attacked by insurgents hiding in a mosque who used rocket propelled grenades as well as guns."
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,The Iraqi soldiers entered the mosque and in the course of fighting injured two insurgents and killed one.
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,The American military also announced that it had captured the leaders of a major car bomb ring in Baghdad responsible for the deaths of more than 900 Iraqis.
3,Iraqis Announce New Steps Aimed at Reconciling Sunnis and Shiites,"Two suicide truck bombs exploded near Ramadi, but initial reports indicated they had killed only the drivers."

5,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Fielding forged his skills in politically charged episodes like Watergate and the air traffic controllers' strike in 1981.

1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Mr.
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Fielding's agreement to take the job surprised some of his closest friends.
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,"The friends said last week, when his name surfaced as a contender for the position, that they would be surprised if he would give up a successful corporate practice for another stint of what promises to be heavy partisan battle at age 67."
5,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Mr.
5,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Fielding was deputy counsel to President Richard M. Nixon under John W. Dean III and was White House counsel for the first five years of Ronald Reagan's presidency.
3,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,"Since then, he has kept a hand in politics and government, helping screen job candidates for President Bush during and after his transition, and serving on the bipartisan Sept. 11 commission."
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Several friends said they believed that he had been under heavy pressure to return as White House counsel by an administration girding for a raft of investigations by the new Democratic Congress.
3,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,The news of his selection was first reported on Monday afternoon on the Time magazine Web site.
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Officials said Mr.
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,"Fielding was always a leading candidate of the White House chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, who is said to have been seeking a possible change in the counsel's office from the moment he took over as chief of staff in April."

1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Fielding for the counsel post underscores the degree to which the White House is girding for potentially intense battles with Democrats.
8,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,"He would help prepare for the possibility that the new Congress may use hearings and, possibly, subpoenas to challenge Mr. Bush's broad assertions of executive power."
8,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,"Representative Henry A. Waxman, the California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, sounded a somewhat combative note."

1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Mr.
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Fielding has a nuanced record on executive privilege and partisan confrontation.

1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Fielding had a major role in securing information and testimony from the White House that it was initially loathe to share.

1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Republicans close to the White House said Mr.
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Fielding had assurances of having a wide berth that he apparently received last week in a meeting with Mr. Bush.
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,"Kenneth M. Duberstein, a chief of staff for Mr. Reagan, said because Mr."
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Fielding had been an aide to two presidents he would not be cowed by the Oval Office or so charmed by the president that he would shy from giving potentially unwelcome advice.
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,"''Fred has an independence of judgment and independence of stature,'' Mr. Duberstein said."
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,''He knows how to deliver tough news.''
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,"All the same, Mr."
1,Reagan Lawyer Ready to Return to White House,Fielding is clearly being brought in to draw legal lines in the sand.

3,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"The White House has invited some Democrats to meet with Mr. Bush before he gives his Iraq speech on Wednesday, even as others have scoured the history books to find cases when Congress has reined in the commander in chief."
2,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"In the most aggressive of the new tactics, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, has said he will introduce legislation on Tuesday to require the president to gain new Congressional authority before sending more troops to Iraq."
3,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,The bill is the first proposal in the Senate that would prohibit paying for an increase in American troops over their level on Jan. 1.

1,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"I don't think so, but that is what's happening, and we have to do everything we can to insist on accountability.''"
3,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,The Kennedy plan is intended to provide Democrats with a road map for how to proceed in Iraq.
1,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"Mr. Kennedy, as he begins his 45th year in the Senate, recalled that Congress interceded during conflicts in Vietnam and Lebanon, and he said Democrats should not hesitate to do so in Iraq."
2,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"The new House speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, has similarly suggested that Democrats consider blocking financing for a troop increase, and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, vowed Monday ''to take a look at it.''"
2,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"But the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, has not endorsed the idea."

8,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"Two weeks later, he announced his opposition, saying his change had nothing to do with other Democratic senators having spoken out against it, but rather with military officials having disagreed with a call for more troops."
1,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"Senator Russell D. Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, said he believed that his party lost the White House in 2004 because of Iraq."
8,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"''My concern now is that too many Democrats are going to want to play it safe on this issue and not take the strong stand that American people demand,'' he said Monday."
1,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,The pressure from war critics on the Democratic left has been particularly intense.
1,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"''The bottom line is that they were elected on a mandate to get the nation out of the mess in Iraq,'' said Eli Pariser, the executive director of MoveOn.org, a liberal political action committee."
3,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"By law, Congress can limit the nature of troop deployments, cap the size of military deployments and cut financing for existing or prospective deployments."
3,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"Since 1970, there have been dozens of occasions in which Congress has tried to step into military action, from Haiti to Bosnia to Kosovo, according to a memorandum being sent Tuesday to lawmakers by the Center for American Progress, a liberal policy group."
8,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"Representative Adam Smith of Washington, vice chairman of the moderate New Democratic Coalition, said he feared that withholding financing -- even for new troops being sent to Iraq -- could have a detrimental effect on all forces."

1,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"''If there are any risks that our efforts to slash the budget would place them at greater risk, that would be unacceptable to me.''"
1,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"But Democrats who are trying to stop Mr. Bush's proposed troop increase, a group led by Mr. Kennedy, say their proposal to block financing will apply only to new troops."
8,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"Mr. Kennedy said he hoped that his legislation would be urgently considered by the full Senate, but acknowledged that it remained an open question whether his Democratic leaders would schedule it for a quick vote."
1,Democrats Split Over Iraq Approach,"''The importance of this legislation is that it will apply now before we could get the escalation,'' he said."

3,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Miles and miles of bigger and stronger levees have been built along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers since the deadly floods of 1993, and millions of dollars have been spent on drainage improvements."
0,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Yet as the rush of water that caused the Missouri River to overflow its banks and submerge dozens of towns last week rolled toward St. Louis on Monday, attention was turned to a metropolitan region that since 1993 has seen runaway residential and commercial development in the rivers' flood paths."
3,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"About 28,000 homes have been built and more than 6,000 acres of commercial and industrial space developed on land that was underwater in 1993, according to research by Nicholas Pinter, a geologist who studies the region at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale."
3,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Building is happening on flood plains across Missouri, but most of the development is in the St. Louis area, and it is estimated to be worth more than $2.2 billion."
3,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Though scientists warn about the danger of such building, the Missouri government has subsidized some of it through tax financing for builders."
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''No one has really looked at the cumulative effect,'' said Timothy M. Kusky, a professor of natural sciences at St. Louis University, who calculates that there has been more development on the Missouri River flood plain in the years since 1993 than at any other time in the history of the region."
8,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"The good news for St. Louis right now is that forecasters say the two rivers will crest well below their 1993 levels by Tuesday, sparing the area significant flooding."
8,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"But many scientists remain concerned that the effect of the new construction, should a levee break, could eventually be even more severe flooding."
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Levees constrict a river's path and raise its water level, which causes higher, faster flow."
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"A flood plain, conversely, exists in nature to absorb a river's overflow."
8,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''The more levees we build, the higher we have to build them,'' Professor Kusky said."
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,''It's a self-perpetuating problem.''
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Still, people have been drawn to the area, assured by the sense of security the levees provide."
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,Disincentives beyond the possibility of flooding seem to be few.
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''This was absolutely a dodged bullet,'' Professor Pinter said."
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''This could have been a very bad situation for St. Louis, but luckily it was a near-miss.''"
3,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"People living in the flood plains are eligible for the National Flood Insurance Program or for any private insurance they can secure, though the private alternatives are increasingly difficult to obtain."
3,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"And they are entitled to whatever federal disaster relief is offered to the state after a flood, be it temporary housing or buyouts, said Butch Kinerney, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency."
5,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"THF Realty Inc. used Missouri's tax program, known as tax increment financing, to build what is said to be the largest strip mall in the country on land in the Chesterfield Valley area of St. Louis County that was submerged in the floods of 1993."
3,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"The shopping center, which cost $275 million to build, opened in 1999 and now has more than two million square feet of retail space, mall officials said."
5,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"The developers spent more than $35 million on levee and storm drainage improvements, replacing an old levee that had offered protection against a 100-year flood with a levee that met the standards for a 500-year flood."
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"And, they said, they have brought jobs and revenue to a formerly sleepy part of the county."
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''We built the shopping center and interchange that opened the entire valley,'' said Marian Nunn, the chief operating officer of THF Realty."
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''The difference is that the levee is maintained now, on top of being bigger, stronger and better."
8,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,The risks are really substantially mitigated.''
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"The company was able to use the special financing because Missouri allows it for projects in areas that are considered blighted, or where development is not likely to occur without help."
8,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''We will continue to build even more,'' Ms. Nunn said."
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,Faith in the levees seems to trump other concerns here.
8,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''We're not even close to having any issues,'' said Brian McGownd, the deputy director of public works in Chesterfield."
8,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Of the new levee, Mr. McGownd said, ''We have 100 percent confidence that it's done right, and the way it's supposed to be, and that it will be a good, strong levee for many years.''"
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Fear of flooding did not appear to scare off prospective buyers at the New Town at St. Charles, a housing development whose sales office hummed with activity on Sunday, even as the Missouri River was rising."
3,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Although the community is near the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, residents are not required to have flood insurance, because they are beyond the 100-year flood plain."
4,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"The location was a selling point for Ken Snider, a high school teacher from St. Louis."
4,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''It's not going to flood here for another 100 years,'' Mr. Snider said, ''and I won't be around by then.''"
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"But critics of the developments say someone else is likely to be around then, and taxpayers in general will carry the tab after the next disaster bailout."
8,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''If history tells us anything, it's that levees once built eventually fail,'' Professor Pinter said."
8,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''But instead of being farmland there, now it's a strip mall or residential area, or a whole city.''"
5,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,The floods of 1993 killed 38 people and caused $16 billion in damage across the Midwest.
5,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,More than 500 counties were declared federal disaster areas.
4,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Adolphus A. Busch IV, a member of the Anheuser-Busch brewing family who helped found the Great Rivers Habitat Alliance in St. Louis in 2000, is alarmed at the pace of development in the rivers' paths after the 1993 flood."
4,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''That was the milestone for us,'' Mr. Busch said."
4,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"''At that point the federal government came in and did major buyouts, and people said, 'Look, we've learned our lesson: no more development.'"
4,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Well, that lasted for about six or seven years.''"
4,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"He continued, ''We always realized that there would be fringe development, but we never envisioned after 1993 that anyone would try to build major levees and enclose thousands of acres.''"
1,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Some people already living in the flood plain at the time of the last big flood now say that it just makes economic sense for them to stay close to the river, and that it is an issue of personal-risk calculation and property rights."
4,Development Rises on St. Louis Area Flood Plains,"Doris Hulst, a 65-year-old school bus driver, is the sole homeowner on a 109-acre swath of land that once housed three trailer parks near the Missouri River in St. Charles County."

3,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"Only about 2,700 of the 25,000 mobile homes ordered at a cost of $850 million have been installed, and at least 10,000 are sitting in Hope, Ark., according to documents and statements from Federal Emergency Management Agency officials."
2,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"Though about 55,000 Louisiana families are still waiting for a manufactured housing unit, the mobile homes may never be used because FEMA regulations prohibit them from being installed in flood-prone coastal areas, federal officials said."
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,Members of a Senate committee investigating the response to Hurricane Katrina called the mobile home episode an appalling example of government stumbling.
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"''These trailers are going to take the place of those very expensive toilet seats that we remember from Pentagon days,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut."
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"''It's really absolutely unbelievable, and unacceptable.''"
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, FEMA ordered far too many mobile homes and too few travel trailers, which are smaller, less expensive and more portable, and can be placed on lots in the disaster zone."
8,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,The federal government had expected that Louisiana officials would identify sites inland where the mobile homes could be placed.
3,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"But so far, with just a few exceptions, they has not done so, officials said."
0,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"''If sites for those mobile homes are not approved in Louisiana, it is possible they will never be used for hurricane relief,'' said Nicol Andrews, a FEMA spokesman."
3,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"The report on the mobile homes, as well as widespread fraud in FEMA's emergency assistance to hurricane victims, came as the federal government's top three domestic security and disaster relief officials vowed to fix flaws in the nation's emergency response programs."
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"''I am accountable and accept responsibility for the performance of the entire department, good and bad,'' the homeland security secretary, Michael Chertoff, told local and state disaster officials at a conference in Alexandria, Va. ''I also have the responsibility to fix what went wrong.''"
8,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"The changes will include a cadre of new disaster response workers who will be available to respond quickly to any natural disaster or terrorist attack, Mr. Chertoff said, which could number as many as 1,500, a department official said."
8,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"The Homeland Security Department is also setting up specialized reconnaissance teams -- with access to helicopters, airplanes and high-tech electronic equipment that can send live video feeds to Washington -- to make sure officials know what is going on in a disaster zone."
8,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"Mr. Chertoff and R. David Paulison, the acting FEMA director, and Frances Fragos Townsend, President Bush's domestic security adviser, also promised to revise rules on debris removal and temporary housing, so local and state governments could move faster to clean up after a disaster and house the homeless."
8,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"Mr. Chertoff, Mr. Paulison and Ms. Townsend, repeating plans Mr. Chertoff outlined last year, also said they would improve communications systems and the registration process for disaster victims, so there would be fewer delays in getting help for those most in need."

3,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"To date, about 72,000 travel trailers have been installed and occupied, of the roughly 100,000 that have been bought."
3,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"Mr. Paulison said the agency was moving to order 10,000 more of the units, which cost about $10,000 each, while mobile homes cost on average $34,000."
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,FEMA officials said that they had installed both trailers and mobile homes after previous disasters and that they had no reason to believe that Hurricane Katrina would be different.
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"But Bill Croft, coordinator for the hurricane housing task force in Louisiana, said federal officials should have realized that many hard-hit communities are in a flood plain, where a federal regulation bans mobile homes."
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"''They are the ones who make these rules,'' Mr. Croft said."
8,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,He suggested that FEMA relax the regulation to allow the mobile homes near the coast.
8,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"Another alternative would involve having the federal government pay Louisiana for the full cost of providing services if large, so-called FEMAvilles with hundreds of mobile homes were created in rural or suburban areas."
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"Ms. Andrews, the FEMA spokeswoman, said that relaxing the flood-plain regulation was not the answer."
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"''There are areas throughout Louisiana and the southeastern United States that aren't in a flood plain,'' she said."
8,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"As it stands, Richard L. Skinner, inspector general at the Homeland Security Department, told the Senate panel, many of the mobile homes might have to be sold as surplus, stored for some future disaster use or given to another federal agency."
8,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"''If they're sold as surplus property, what kind of return can you expect on that?''"
8,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, asked Mr. Skinner."
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,His answer infuriated the panelmembers.
8,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"''It's certainly not going to be very high,'' he responded, given the way they were being stored at a spot where some are sinking into the mud."
1,Trailer Dispute May Mean Thousands Will Go Unused,"''Some of the trailers that we inspected are actually warping, have lost wheels, and some have been cannibalized, parts taken out, and we don't even know where the parts are right now."

0,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"Michael was not the only tropical cyclone in recent years to undergo what scientists refer to as “rapid intensification,” defined as an acceleration of wind speeds of at least 35 mph (56 kph) in 24 hours or less."
2,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,The phenomenon has become more serious as sea waters have warmed with climate change.
2,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"“It is most likely that the very warm water in the Gulf ... is likely contributing to the intensity and the intensification that we have seen,” said Jim Kossin, an atmospheric scientist with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."
3,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"Rapid intensification is dangerous because it gives businesses, industry and people on the ground less time to take appropriate precautions ahead of hurricanes like Michael that hit shore with far more furious winds than originally expected."
2,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"Several factors can contribute, but warmer waters increase the potential for a storm becoming stronger, climate scientists have said."
2,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"Climate change means that warmer ocean temperatures are being seen more often, said Jennie Evans, a professor of Meteorology at Pennsylvania State University."
2,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"“Since we’ve got warm temperatures in the Gulf now, a hurricane has a much better chance to reach its maximum possible intensity, which appears to be what Michael is doing,” she said."
3,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"In some cases, high-altitude winds can put a cap on a storm’s ability to draw power from moist sea air."
3,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"But in Michael’s case, that brake was not in place."
3,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,Rapid intensification happens about 5 percent of the time and is difficult to predict.
5,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"Last year, in the Atlantic basin, forecasters correctly forecast six of 39 such instances, according to Michael Brennan, branch chief of the hurricane specialist unit at the U.S. National Hurricane Center."
5,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,The NHC said last year it failed to adequately predict the rapid intensification of Hurricane Matthew in 2016 to a Category 5 storm with maximum sustained winds of 165 mph (270 kph).
5,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"Matthew was directly responsible for 585 deaths, including more than 500 people in Haiti, the NHC said."
3,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"While the science of tracking a storm relies heavily on data about conditions on its periphery, predicting intensity relies on measuring what is happening in the middle of it."
3,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"Typically, that means flying a hurricane hunter aircraft inside the storm, recording wind speeds from a weather buoy as a storm passes overhead or relying on satellites that may fly over once every other day."
3,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"Collecting consistent data through the storm is difficult and limits the ability to predict intensity, hurricane experts have said."
3,Warm Gulf waters spawned Hurricane Michael's intensity: scientists,"In recent storms that have intensified quickly, the phenomenon has been more exaggerated than in the past, according to a recent research paper co-authored by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory researcher Karthik Balaguru."

5,Four Years Later in Iraq,"Four years ago this week, as American troops made their first, triumphant entrance into Baghdad, joyous Iraqis pulled down a giant statue of Saddam Hussein."
1,Four Years Later in Iraq,"It was powerful symbolism -- a murderous dictator toppled, Baghdadis taking to the streets without fear, American soldiers hailed as liberators."
3,Four Years Later in Iraq,"After four years of occupation, untold numbers killed by death squads and suicide bombers, and searing experiences like Abu Ghraib, few Iraqis still look on American soldiers as liberators."
3,Four Years Later in Iraq,"Instead, thousands marked this week's anniversary by burning American flags and marching through the streets of Najaf chanting, ''Death to America.''"
3,Four Years Later in Iraq,"Once again, tens of thousands of American troops are pouring into Baghdad."
0,Four Years Later in Iraq,Yesterday the Pentagon announced that battle-weary Army units in Iraq would have to stay on for an additional three months past their scheduled return dates.
8,Four Years Later in Iraq,"Mr. Bush is desperately gambling that by stretching the Army to the absolute limits of its deployable strength, he may be able to impose some relative calm in the capital."
8,Four Years Later in Iraq,"And he seems to imagine that should that gamble succeed, the Shiite-dominated government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki will, without any serious pressure from Washington, take the steps toward sharing political power and economic resources it has tenaciously resisted since the day it took office a year ago."

1,Four Years Later in Iraq,"Now, with friends and relatives killed, kidnapped or driven from their homes, the prices of basic necessities soaring and electricity rationed to four hours a day, Mr. Jubouri says the change of regimes ''achieved nothing'' and he has come to hate the American military presence he once welcomed."
1,Four Years Later in Iraq,Mr. Maliki's supporters can be even more frightening to listen to.
3,Four Years Later in Iraq,"This week's demonstration in Najaf was organized by the fiercely anti-American Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, whose political party and militia helped put Mr. Maliki in power and are still among his most important allies."
1,Four Years Later in Iraq,"Two months into the Baghdad security drive, the gains Mr. Bush is banking on have not materialized."
8,Four Years Later in Iraq,"More American soldiers continue to arrive, and their commanders are talking about extending the troop buildup through the fall or into early next year."
1,Four Years Later in Iraq,"After four years, the political trend is even more discouraging."
1,Four Years Later in Iraq,There is no possible triumph in Iraq and very little hope left.
