1,ISRAELI HOUSING PLAN ADDS TO TENSIONS AHEAD OF TALKS,"While the planning and building of settlements have continued in the months preceding the talks, causing constant friction, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s new governing coalition had so far refrained from issuing construction bids since it was formed in March."

1,ISRAELI HOUSING PLAN ADDS TO TENSIONS AHEAD OF TALKS,The decision to release 104 prisoners over the coming months is deeply unpopular in Israel.
1,ISRAELI HOUSING PLAN ADDS TO TENSIONS AHEAD OF TALKS,Netanyahu has explained it as a gesture that was necessary to persuade the Palestinian leadership to agree to resume long-stalled negotiations and that was preferable to acceding to other Palestinian demands like a settlement freeze.
8,ISRAELI HOUSING PLAN ADDS TO TENSIONS AHEAD OF TALKS,But it appears that the talks Wednesday will be taking place amid a storm of mutual recrimination.

5,MAN LINKED BY U.S. TO HEZBOLLAH IS ARRESTED IN BRAZIL,"In 2004, the Treasury Department called Barakat’s brother, Assad Ahmad Barakat, one of Hezbollah’s “most prominent and influential members,” and said he used an electronics wholesale store in the Triple Frontier as a cover for raising funds for Hezbollah."

0,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"NEW YORK - Joseph J. Lhota, making his first campaign appearances since winning the Republican nomination for mayor, on Thursday criticized his likely Democratic opponent, Bill de Blasio, accusing him of trying to divide the city by class in order to score votes."
3,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"Lhota, in a series of interviews, portrayed de Blasio as a free-spending liberal who wants to raise taxes, and who would seek to undo the progress made by the current mayor, Michael Bloomberg, and his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani."
1,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"“His approach to things is to tear things down and build them up in the image that he wants, which I think is a failed image,” Lhota said in a television interview."
1,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"He said de Blasio’s approach amounted to “a repudiation of everything great that’s happened over the last 20 years, and we can’t let that happen.”"
1,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"The media tour by Lhota marked the beginning of an effort by the candidate to appeal to a wide audience of voters, after months in which he focused on drumming up support among the Republicans whose support he needed in Tuesday’s primary."
3,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"His remarks came as the Democratic race remained unsettled, with de Blasio hovering slightly above the 40 percent threshold required to avoid a runoff, but thousands of paper ballots still to count."
3,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"De Blasio, trying to create an air of inevitability about his nomination, held a rally in Brooklyn with supporters, many of whom had earlier endorsed his rivals."
3,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"In Lhota’s appearances, which also included radio interviews, he acknowledged that the Democratic primary was still unresolved, but he spoke as if de Blasio were his opponent."
0,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"He mounted a direct attack on de Blasio’s “tale of two cities” campaign theme, saying that de Blasio was trying to “separate classes” as a political strategy."
0,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"“Calling it a tale of two cities, that level of invective has no place in any campaign, at all,” Lhota said."
0,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,“It divides people.
0,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"What we really need to do is to work together and provide a solution, not separating people and then saying that the ends justify the means.”"
1,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"He also criticized the policy centerpiece of de Blasio’s campaign, a proposal to raise taxes on high earners to pay for expanded prekindergarten and after-school programs."
1,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"Lhota said that de Blasio’s “knee-jerk response to any new program is to raise taxes,” an approach he said was “instinctively wrong.” Instead, Lhota said the mayor should look to find efficiencies in the city’s budget."
3,LHOTA ACCUSES DE BLASIO OF TRYING TO DIVIDE THE CITY,"Lhota also visited the Queens burial site of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, who was the revered leader of Lubavitch Hasidim."

2,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"NEW YORK - When Joseph C. Massino took the witness stand in 2011, becoming the first official boss of one of New York’s five crime families to break the code of silence and testify against a former confederate, he offered a succinct explanation for his departure from mob tradition."
8,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"“I’m hoping to see a light at the end of the tunnel,” he said."
0,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"On Wednesday, the tunnel got a whole lot shorter: A federal judge commuted Massino’s sentence of two consecutive life terms in prison."
8,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"Massino, the former boss of the Bonanno crime family, will be released from federal custody in 60 days, a period the government requested to put in place security arrangements to keep Massino safe from what are presumed to be a considerable number of enemies."
2,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn had sought a reduction of Massino’s sentence, citing his extensive cooperation: While incarcerated, Massino had recorded conversations with a Mafia captain, and he has provided investigators with information about hundreds of people associated with not only the Bonanno family, which Massino took control of in 1991, but also the other crime families across New York."
0,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"At a brief hearing in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on Wednesday, Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis credited the government’s arguments and decided to undo the sentence of two life terms that he had originally meted out to Massino."
5,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"When that sentence was handed down, in 2005, clapping could be heard in his courtroom."
1,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"But on Wednesday, the judge said that in deciding to free Massino after more than 10 years of incarceration, he had considered the aging mobster’s “extraordinary cooperation with the government and his willingness to place himself at grave personal risk.”"
8,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"Once released, Massino will probably receive a new identity and live elsewhere in the United States, his lawyer, Edward A. McDonald, said after the hearing."
1,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,McDonald said that Massino could support himself on rental income from his property and that he was also eligible for Social Security income.
1,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"Garaufis said that Massino, a rotund man of 70 whose health is failing, “may be the most important cooperator in the modern history of law enforcement efforts to prosecute the American Mafia.” He said that Massino’s assistance was essential in the investigations of the four leaders of the Bonanno family who followed him."
8,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,The judge also noted that Massino’s willingness to turn informer “has almost certainly caused numerous other members of organized crime to cooperate with the government.”
3,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,Massino’s own crimes received only passing mention on Wednesday.
2,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"He has been convicted of eight murders, including those of several rivals in the Bonanno family."
3,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"Massino, who wore a two-toned sweatsuit, said little during the hearing, leaving most of the speaking to his lawyer."
3,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"But Massino did offer a brief statement of remorse, which he delivered standing in a single breath, and then quickly sat down."
1,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"“I pray every night for forgiveness of everyone I hurt, especially the victims’ families,” he said."
3,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"A prosecutor, Taryn A. Merkl, said that the government had reached out to the families of Massino’s victims to inquire if any wanted to make a statement in court, but had not received any responses."
1,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"Merkl said that nothing about the government’s decision to take Massino’s side “apologizes or condones the life he led, yet at the same time he decided to make a change.”"
8,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,Details of the life Massino will lead after his release were scarce.
8,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"Garaufis directed Massino to continue to cooperate with the government, noting that prosecutors had informed him that Massino was helping with a number of investigations that were still pending."
8,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"Garaufis said Massino’s age and ill health reduced “the court’s concern about possible recidivism.” Nonetheless, he ordered that Massino not associate “for the rest of your life” with known organized crime figures."
1,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"McDonald would not comment on the nature of his client’s health ailments, except to say that Massino often said he “had everything except cancer.”"
1,JUDGE COMMUTES 2 LIFE SENTENCES FOR MOB BOSS WHO BECAME INFORMER,"McDonald described his client as “a stoic guy,” but said Massino often told him that “if he had to make the decision again, if he was 18 or 19 years old, he wouldn’t go into the Mafia.”"

2,"STUYVESANT PRINCIPAL, NOW RETIRED, MISHANDLED CHEATING CASE, REPORT SAYS","The principal, Stanley Teitel, retired last summer while the city’s Education Department was investigating his handling of the cheating, which involved more than 60 students using smartphones to receive answers for standardized city and state tests."
2,"STUYVESANT PRINCIPAL, NOW RETIRED, MISHANDLED CHEATING CASE, REPORT SAYS","The report, issued by the Education Department’s Office of Special Investigations, said that after Teitel was tipped off by a student about the cheating, he set up a sting operation to catch the ringleader when he should have tried to pre-emptively thwart the cheating, including by enforcing the citywide ban on phones inside schools."
2,"STUYVESANT PRINCIPAL, NOW RETIRED, MISHANDLED CHEATING CASE, REPORT SAYS","The report said that Teitel and an assistant principal, Randi Damesek, took too long to question students involved and did not report the cheating to state officials until eight days after catching the lead student, when reporters began inquiring about what had happened."

0,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,PARIS - Czech prosecutors asked the Parliament on Monday to strip former Prime Minister Petr Necas of immunity from prosecution.
8,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,Law enforcement officials said the request was a prelude to charging Necas with corruption.
8,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,Necas would be the highest-level official to face corruption charges in the country since the fall of communism.
3,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"A bookish, churchgoing father of four, Necas came to power in 2010 promising to clean up a culture of cronyism and corruption, but he was forced to resign last month after his chief of staff was charged with bribery and abuse of office."
3,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"The chief of staff - Jana Nagyova, a close confidante of Necas - is accused of ordering the secret services to spy on Necas’ estranged wife, whom he is divorcing."
3,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,Nagyova has also been charged with offering bribes in the form of posts at state-owned companies to three members of Parliament who opposed a government austerity plan.
2,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"Prosecutors said they were examining whether Necas had links to the bribery scheme, which some analysts and supporters of Necas have dismissed as the routine trading of political favors rather than a criminal act."
1,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"Necas said Monday that no agreement had been made with the three lawmakers, and that, in any case, political agreements could not be considered crimes."
1,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"“It is not clear to me what I should be charged with,” he said in a statement."
1,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"“So far, all the information we have shows that this whole case is about criminalizing political decisions."
1,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,I refuse this approach.
1,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,I find it unacceptable and I shall not accept it.
1,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,I am ready to defend myself.”
8,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"Jindrich Sidlo, a commentator for Hospodarske Noviny, a leading economic newspaper, said on Monday that going ahead with charges in the case would turn Czech politics upside down."
1,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"“If this political deal is bribery, then this would be the end of politics in the Czech Republic as we have known it for the past 20 years,” he said by telephone from Prague."
1,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"But Ivo Istvan, the chief prosecutor in the case, said that using a state job to entice a lawmaker to resign did constitute bribery, no different than offering a briefcase full of money."
1,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"“If a member of Parliament does not act in the public interest in order to be awarded a state job, we can speak about political corruption,” Istvan said."
1,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,“We need to ask if Parliament is a place where parliamentarians vote according to their conscience or according to what it can buy them.”
8,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"The parliamentary committee that deals with immunity is scheduled to discuss the case July 17, with a vote by the full Parliament expected to take place in September."
1,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,Analysts said it was difficult to predict the outcome.
3,CZECH PROSECUTORS PREPARE TO CHARGE EX-PREMIER,"President Milos Zeman has appointed Jiri Rusnok, a leftist former finance minister, to replace Necas."

0,MINISTER ’ S PAST CAUSES TURMOIL IN NEW JERSEY,"Just two weeks earlier, the parishioners learned that a minister working with their church’s youth groups had been barred from being around children unsupervised – a restriction he accepted to avoid retrial on a sex abuse charge."

5,MINISTER ’ S PAST CAUSES TURMOIL IN NEW JERSEY,"The priest, Michael Fugee, was convicted in 2003 of criminal sexual conduct stemming from allegations that he had groped a boy’s crotch during several wrestling horseplay encounters when he was associate pastor at St. Elizabeth Church in Wyckoff."
5,MINISTER ’ S PAST CAUSES TURMOIL IN NEW JERSEY,"Three years later, an appellate court overturned the conviction, in part because the judge allowed jurors to hear a statement Fugee made to the police saying he was attracted to males, according to The Star-Ledger of Newark."
2,MINISTER ’ S PAST CAUSES TURMOIL IN NEW JERSEY,"Rather than begin another trial, Fugee and the Bergen County prosecutor’s office signed an agreement that he would enter sex-offender treatment and have no unsupervised contact with children as part of his church duties."
2,MINISTER ’ S PAST CAUSES TURMOIL IN NEW JERSEY,"The 2007 agreement was also signed by the Archdiocese of Newark, which was required to ensure that Fugee was not assigned any tasks that would put him in a position to have unsupervised contact with children, including involvement with youth groups, attending youth retreats or hearing confessions of children."

0,ABBAS ACCEPTS PRIME MINISTER'S RESIGNATION,"JERUSALEM - President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority on Sunday accepted the resignation of his prime minister, Rami Hamdallah, who had asked to quit two weeks after being sworn into office."
8,ABBAS ACCEPTS PRIME MINISTER'S RESIGNATION,"The latest power struggles in the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule, deepened the image of political disarray, days before Secretary of State John Kerry was expected back in the region to try to revive peace talks with Israel."
1,ABBAS ACCEPTS PRIME MINISTER'S RESIGNATION,"But in what appeared to be an effort to project a minimal level of stability, a spokesman for Abbas told the official Palestinian news agency Wafa that Abbas asked Hamdallah to stay on in a caretaker role until a replacement could be found."
2,ABBAS ACCEPTS PRIME MINISTER'S RESIGNATION,"Hamdallah had replaced Salam Fayyad, an internationally respected economist who served as prime minister for six years."
2,ABBAS ACCEPTS PRIME MINISTER'S RESIGNATION,"Fayyad quit in April, partly because of a dispute over his powers, but he stayed on as a caretaker until Hamdallah’s appointment."
2,ABBAS ACCEPTS PRIME MINISTER'S RESIGNATION,"Palestinian officials said that Hamdallah had resigned because of a conflict over his authority and responsibilities, and they suggested that his primary problem was with his two deputy prime ministers."

0,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,"GENEVA - The U.N. human rights chief, Navi Pillay, on Friday condemned Iraq’s execution of 42 prisoners over two days this week, denouncing such mass executions as “obscene and inhuman” and warning that they undermined efforts to reduce violence and achieve a more stable society."
1,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,"Iraq’s justice system is “too deeply flawed to warrant even a limited use of the death penalty, let alone dozens of executions at a time,” Pillay said in a statement released in Geneva, repeating a view she has expressed on several occasions."
1,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,"At least some of the latest executions, which were carried out Wednesday and Thursday, breached international law because Iraq is unable to hold fair trials, Pillay’s spokesman, Rupert Colville, told reporters."
1,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,"And Iraq’s decision to proceed with executions Thursday, which was World Day Against the Death Penalty, was “particularly perverse,” Pillay said."
3,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,"Iraq’s Justice Ministry said the executed prisoners had been convicted of “terrorist crimes, killing dozens of innocents in addition to other crimes aimed at destabilizing the country, causing chaos and spreading horror.”"
1,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,Pillay also expressed concern about the “dramatic and shocking increase” in Iraq’s resort to the death penalty.
3,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,"This week’s executions brought to 140 the number of people executed so far this year, compared with 123 in 2012 and 18 in 2010, the United Nations reported."
7,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,"Pillay will be in direct contact with Iraqi authorities in the coming days, Colville said, but in the meantime she urged the government to immediately halt executions and to commute the sentences of about 900 prisoners now held on death row."
1,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,"U.N. human rights officials say the integrity of the judicial system has been tainted, citing the numerous reports of confessions obtained through torture and ill-treatment, the weakness of the judiciary and trial procedures that fall far short of international standards."
1,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,"They also said some of the offenses for which prisoners are executed did not meet the threshold of “most serious crimes,” which international law sets for the use of the death penalty."
1,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,"Iraq’s justification for using the death penalty as a deterrent to terrorism was “clearly exposed as a fallacy” by the sharp rise in civilian casualties over the same period, Pillay noted."
3,U.N. HUMAN RIGHTS CHIEF CONDEMNS MASS EXECUTIONS IN IRAQ,"The rash of recent bombings in the capital, Baghdad, and other parts of the country had driven up civilian casualties to the highest level since 2008, Pillay observed."

0,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"DAKAR, Senegal - Charles Blé Goudé, a crucial ally of Laurent Gbagbo, the Ivory Coast strongman indicted on charges of crimes against humanity, is being sought on similar charges, the International Criminal Court said Tuesday."
5,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"Blé Goudé played a central role in Gbagbo’s efforts to stay in power by force after his defeat in presidential elections in November 2010, recruiting and arming youths who went on to beat and sometimes murder opponents in the economic capital, Abidjan."
1,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"He was known as the “general of the streets,” and the youth militia he founded, the Jeunes Patriotes, or Young Patriots, was notorious for its brutality, extortionate checkpoints and frenzied rallies presided over by Blé Goudé."
2,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"An indictment against him, unsealed Tuesday by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, has been pending since December 2011, eight months after he fled Ivory Coast when Gbagbo, the former president, was ousted by the French military."
5,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,Blé Goudé was subsequently arrested in Ghana and extradited to Ivory Coast in January of this year.
3,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"The indictment accuses him of crimes of humanity including murder and rape and calls him a member of Gbagbo’s inner circle who met with him to receive instructions and formulate plans, playing “a key role in recruiting, enlisting, arming, training and integrating thousands of volunteers” into the army."
1,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"The wounds of the brief but bloody 2010-11 civil war - more than 3,000 people died - in Ivory Coast, in which Blé Goudé participated actively, are not healed."
5,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"Rural warlords who helped bring Gbagbo’s presidential opponent, Alassane Ouattara, to power still play important military and economic roles, notably in smuggling and in other “predatory economic activities,” according to a report by a United Nations group of experts in April that underlined the country’s political fragility."
5,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"Gbagbo’s partisans remain armed; about $400 million in cocoa beans - Ivory Coast is the world’s leading producer and was once West Africa’s economic powerhouse - was lost to smuggling in 2011-12, according to the report."
5,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"Long before the civil war, the Jeunes Patriotes had several times been mobilized against forces perceived to be threatening Gbagbo’s power, including the French and the United Nations, with violent results."
3,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"Blé Goudé is now being held by the authorities in Ivory Coast, and it is not clear whether they will release him to The Hague."
2,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"Eleven days ago they announced that they would not be sending Gbagbo’s wife, Simone, also under indictment, to The Hague, but instead would try her at home."
1,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"Human rights activists in Ivory Coast said they doubted that Blé Goudé could receive a fair trial in that country, pointing out, for instance, that his lawyer there has no access to him."
3,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"In addition, some of the very rebel leaders who helped Ouattara gain power are accused of crimes similar to those Gbagbo and his associates are accused of."
3,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,But so far they have not been arrested.
1,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"“We think justice in Ivory Coast is victors’ justice,” said Hervé Gouamene, Blé Goudé’s lawyer in Abidjan."
1,ALLY OF IVORY COAST STRONGMAN SOUGHT BY INTERNATIONAL COURT,"“Everyone knows crimes were committed on the other side, too."

1,RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER ASSERTS INNOCENCE AT TRIAL,"The trial, streamed on the Internet, has promised to be an important touchstone in President Vladimir V. Putin’s long career, as prosecutors have not previously indicted a high-profile politician, but it has gotten off to a languid start."

3,RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER ASSERTS INNOCENCE AT TRIAL,"Within an hour of opening, however, Judge Sergei A. Blinov granted a request by the defense lawyers for an adjournment so they could better prepare for trial."

1,RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER ASSERTS INNOCENCE AT TRIAL,"“To all those involved in the illegal investigation, sooner or later you will face a severe but just punishment.”"
3,RUSSIAN OPPOSITION LEADER ASSERTS INNOCENCE AT TRIAL,"Others who have challenged Putin have faced prosecution, most notably the Yukos oil tycoon, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, who remains in prison, but the case against Navalny is the first in post-Soviet Russia against a high-profile political figure."

0,"News Analysis: Italy 2019 budget plan unnerves markets, ignores EU austerity calls - Xinhua","Thursday's blueprint says the government would widen the 2019 budget deficit to an estimated 2.4 percent of the gross domestic product, almost surely putting the country on a collision course with the European Union (EU)."
3,"News Analysis: Italy 2019 budget plan unnerves markets, ignores EU austerity calls - Xinhua","The EU has called for Italy to focus on paying down the government's deficit, the highest in the bloc in absolute terms and the second highest when measured as a percentage of gross domestic product."

1,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,Major Luiz Fernando Aguiar said Brazil wants to get a piece of the $300 billion-a-year space launch business by drawing U.S. companies interested in launching small satellites at a lower cost from the Alcantara base on its north coast.
1,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,"“The microsatellite market is most attractive today and we are interested in the 50 to 500-kilo niche,” Aguiar told Reuters at the base’s main launch pad."

1,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,For that this tower is totally ready.”
2,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,Space cooperation between the United States and Brazil took a big step forward when they signed a Space Situational Awareness (SSA) agreement last month during a visit to Brasilia by U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis.
3,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,The accord on sharing real-time tracking data on objects and debris in space is needed to develop a satellite launching business without the risk of collision.
5,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,"Boeing Co (BA.N) and Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) in December visited the Alcantara space center, which is especially attractive to smaller firms, such as Tucson, Arizona-based rocket-maker Vector Launch Inc, because its equatorial location cuts fuel costs by a third allowing heavier payloads."
8,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,"But Brazil’s plan to become a new hub in the space industry will depend on concluding a technology safeguard agreement (TSA) with the United States to protect sensitive American space launch and satellite technology, Aguiar said."
8,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,"Without it, no U.S. rocket can blast off from the South American country."
5,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,A previous attempt at a U.S.-Brazilian space partnership was scuttled in 2003 when the TSA ran into resistance from the leftist government of former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and was thwarted by Brazilian lawmakers.
1,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,Aguiar said that agreement floundered because it allowed the U.S. unverified access to the Alcantara base that was not acceptable on sovereignty grounds.
1,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,A new Brazilian proposal under consideration by the U.S. government will be more “palatable” to the Brazilian Congress.
1,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,The TSA is seen by Washington as opening opportunities for greater cooperation in aerospace and defense between the two countries.
8,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,The market for small satellite launches is expected to grow fast in the next few years and the U.S. space industry is keen to see new launch capacity in the world and a quick resolution to the negotiation of the TSA with Brazil.
1,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,“Demand for launch services has outstripped supply globally and another launch site is needed.
1,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,"Because of its location, Alcantara offers advantages no other site in the world provides,” an industry source said."

3,Brazil space station open for small satellite business,He said the Air Force has been in talks with Brazilian aerospace company Embraer SA on how to manage the business going forward.

5,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China",It wasn’t clear whether Toyota approached the Chinese companies about a partnership or vice versa.
1,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China","Local production would be a major shift for the world’s largest automaker, encouraged by improved China-Japan ties, as well as new Chinese investment rules that might allow foreign automakers to fully own or majority-control China operations."
1,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China","“We’re torn over this,” said one of the insiders."
1,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China","“But it makes little sense to let this opportunity slip by,” another told Reuters."
3,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China",All four insiders declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.
2,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China",China’s planned scrapping of foreign ownership restrictions in the auto industry is in part a response to criticism that Chinese companies have been largely allowed to invest freely in outside markets while Beijing limits foreign firms’ access to the world’s second-largest economy.
3,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China",The rule changes - affecting electric carmakers this year and others by 2022 - led Tesla Inc to gain Beijing’s approval for a wholly-owned China manufacturing and sales company in Shanghai.
3,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China",That marked the first time a foreign carmaker established itself in China without a partner.
3,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China","Toyota already produces numerous Toyota-brand models, including the Camry, Highlander, Corolla, Levin and Crown, in China with partners."
5,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China","Last year it sold 1.29 million cars there, including imported Lexuses."

3,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China",Two of the Toyota insiders said the automaker had identified specific scenarios for localizing Lexus.
1,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China","“All the preparation has been more or less completed,” one said."

1,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China","“You’d still need a good political follow-wind to execute this,” one of the sources said, pointing to help from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has a state visit to China planned for this month."
3,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China","Even as other premium brands - such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Cadillac - have opened assembly plants in China to gain market share, Toyota has resisted."
1,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China",That reluctance reflects the company’s unwillingness to share with a Chinese partner a brand painstakingly built since 1989 into a top premium car in the United States.
3,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China",Opponents inside Toyota also point to China’s lowering tariffs on passenger cars to 15 percent from 25 percent in July as a reason to keep importing Lexuses.
3,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China",They also note that the nearest Lexus plant to China is at the northern tip of Japan’s southernmost main island of Kyushu -only two days from Shanghai by sea.
1,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China",A Toyota spokesman in Tokyo said “the most important task” for Lexus is to become a distinguished brand in China.

1,"Toyota, sensing an opening, debates building Lexus cars in China","“But at this point in time, we don’t have any specific plans for producing Lexus cars in China.”"

6,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,WANTED: Central banker who can curb ''irrational exuberance'' among stock market investors.
6,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,Statesmen with international credibility preferred.
6,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,Availability soon.
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Too bad Alan Greenspan, who does not speak Chinese, can't apply."
0,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"One of the biggest challenges for Chinese leaders these days lies in when and how to rein in the country's soaring stock market and, just as important, whom to pick as the next governor of the central bank."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,The challenges are closely intertwined.
3,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Like Mr. Greenspan nearly a decade ago, Zhou Xiaochuan, the current governor of the People's Bank of China, faces the knotty question of what to do about a speculative mania that has drawn millions of people with limited investing experience into betting their savings on the stock market."
5,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Mr. Greenspan, now 81, struggled to contain the tech stock boom, issuing his famous ''irrational exuberance'' warning in December 1996 only to watch the American market keep rising and finally collapse in early 2000."
8,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"He tried his hand at forecasting Chinese stocks on Wednesday, telling an audience in Madrid by satellite that the Chinese market was ''clearly unsustainable'' and could undergo a ''dramatic contraction.''"
2,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"After setting records on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the A shares, those traded in yuan, fell 0.47 percent in Shanghai and 0.6 percent in Shenzhen on Thursday as investors responded to the warning."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,But the warning was not news to Mr. Zhou and other Chinese officials.
3,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"The central bank, securities regulators and prominent business executives have all been cautioning investors that buying stocks is not a guaranteed path to riches -- all with less apparent effect than Mr. Greenspan."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,''Will the Shanghai market correct at some stage?
8,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Yes, that's inevitable,'' said Michael R. P. Smith, the chief executive of HSBC's extensive Asian operations."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"''Valuations are too high, I think; you can't sustain P/E multiples of 40, 50 times.''"
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"The economy is booming, but fairly low inflation, 3 percent, also makes for a conundrum similar to what Mr. Greenspan faced as Federal Reserve chairman: it is harder for Mr. Zhou to justify raising interest rates significantly."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"For Mr. Zhou, there is a further complication in that he faces considerable uncertainty about his personal future."
3,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Five years into his current job, he turns 60 next year, and so by Chinese standards is due for a transfer or promotion."
8,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"''It could come at any time; I tend to think it will happen before the 17th Party Congress,'' expected in October or November, said Victor Shih, a Chinese banking specialist at Northwestern."
8,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,Whoever succeeds Mr. Zhou confronts one of the toughest challenges of any financial policy maker.
3,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Chinese families eager to make money are opening brokerage accounts around the country, with the number of new accounts rocketing from several thousand a day two years ago to nearly 300,000 a day this month."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Investors leaving a Shanghai brokerage firm on Wednesday were exuberant, as the Shanghai A share index closed at 4,354."
4,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Chen Zhiwei, a restaurant chef, said, ''With more new stocks listed, the bullish trend will keep going until the index hits 15,000.''"
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Like Mr. Greenspan in the heat of the Internet frenzy, Mr. Zhou and his colleagues in the Chinese government have been cautious about trying to pop the bubble themselves."
5,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"The Chinese government chose administrative measures, instead of market forces like higher interest rates, to prevent the economy from overheating in 2004 and to curb real estate speculation over the last two years."
3,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"The government has taken a few such measures this year, like investigating fund managers to make sure that they do not engage in self-dealing at the expense of their clients, and requiring this week that new brokerage customers sign forms acknowledging that they understand the risks of stocks."
2,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"But stocks sailed higher on Wednesday after an announcement by the finance ministry and State Administration of Taxation that the government had no plans to raise taxes on share transactions, an approach the government has sometimes taken in the past to curb speculation."
3,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,Cash is pouring into the stock market partly because money is pouring into China in general.
8,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"With the Chinese government intervening heavily in currency markets to hold down the value of the yuan against the dollar, China is on course for a surplus this year of up to $400 billion in the current account, the broadest measure of trade."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,The Chinese leadership has shown considerable caution in allowing the currency to appreciate.
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,Mr. Zhou declared Wednesday morning that gradualism would remain China's policy as it pursues a long-term strategy of making the yuan more ''flexible.''
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Chinese officials frequently refer to flexibility in describing a willingness to see more intraday volatility in the yuan, which remains tightly linked to the dollar."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,But that does not necessarily mean faster appreciation of the yuan.
8,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Raising interest rates, a conventional cure for asset speculation, runs the risk of attracting even more foreign investment to China."
3,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"The People's Bank of China has raised interest rates only four times in the last 13 months, while also raising eight times the percentage of assets that commercial banks must keep as reserves at the central bank."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Partly because the People's Bank of China does not have nearly the same independence as the Federal Reserve and partly because Chinese economic policy makers have shunned the celebrity surrounding many of their overseas counterparts, Mr. Zhou has not attracted as much attention as Mr. Greenspan."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,But now he is the subject of a guessing game about possible successors -- and about the extent to which career jockeying may make public officials leery of unpopular decisions.
8,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"The most commonly cited potential governors are Shang Fulin, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission; Guo Shuqing, Communist Party secretary of the China Construction Bank; and Wu Xiaoling, who is the central bank's senior deputy governor but at 60 may already be deemed too old to succeed Mr. Zhou."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Mr. Zhou was president of China Construction Bank and then chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission before taking over leadership of the central bank, so Mr. Shang and Mr. Guo could each be viewed as possibly following in his footsteps."
8,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"As for Mr. Zhou himself, he is cited by some experts as a contender to rise as high as deputy prime minister of China -- if he can stay popular a few more months."
8,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,But a possible slump in the stock market could hurt Mr. Zhou's future prospects -- even if damage to the broader economy may be limited.
8,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"Some experts, like Jonathan Anderson, the chief Asia economist at UBS, suggest that because the rising stock market seems to have had little effect on the rate of economic growth over the last year and a half, it may not have much effect going down."
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"''It's very hard indeed to see where the negative growth impact would come from,'' he said in a research report on Thursday, noting that equities form a tenth of total household and business wealth in China."
4,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"As he left a Shanghai brokerage firm on Wednesday, Wang Jianping, a 52-year-old driver, said that he invested only his own savings in the stock market and never borrowed to buy shares."
4,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"''If I make money, that's great -- if I lose money, it won't hurt my quality of life and it will be O.K.,'' he said."
4,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"''If I don't make money on the investment in my lifetime, I'll leave it to my children and grandchildren.''"
1,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"The bigger worry, but much harder to calculate, lies in whether the country's banks have unintentionally or secretly lent heavily to stock market speculators who would not be able to repay their loans if the market collapsed."
3,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,Chinese banking regulations bar banks from issuing margin loans directly to stock market investors.
3,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"But banks are allowed to lend to securities firms, which in turn provide margin financing."
3,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"State-controlled media have also reported this year that regulators are looking into whether stock speculators are misrepresenting their intentions to banks, claiming that they need loans for real estate or other purposes."
3,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"For lack of data, credit analysts have been unable to assess the scale of bank exposure to the stock market."
4,China’s Leaders Confront Their Manic Market,"''We can't see it,'' said Charlene Chu, an analyst in the Beijing office of Fitch Ratings, ''on the balance sheets.''"

3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"By comparison, highflying diversified emerging-market stock funds attracted $6.6 billion and domestic large-blend funds drew $4 billion, according to Financial Research."
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"But does investing in blue chips abroad achieve the same results for a portfolio as investing in big, high-quality domestic stocks?"
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"The answer is still no, given the currency risks that you inevitably take on when investing abroad."
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"Yet a growing number of people argue that foreign and domestic stocks are becoming more alike, given the increased correlation among the world's markets."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"Since 1970, for example, the Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE index, for European, Australian and Far Eastern stocks, has returned 11.6 percent a year, on average."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,That is nearly identical to the annualized gain of 11.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index of domestic blue chips.
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"But keep in mind that those slightly higher gains came with slightly higher risk, as foreign stocks on their own are still more volatile than domestic equities."
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"Sometimes, a modest dose of a risky asset can make an entire portfolio less volatile."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"From 1970 to 2005, a 100 percent stock portfolio invested in the S.& P. 500 would have earned 11.1 percent, annualized, according to S.& P. And that is with a so-called standard deviation -- a popular measure of volatility -- of 16.8."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"But by moving 25 percent of that money from the S.& P. 500 to the EAFE index, the portfolio would have earned 11.4 percent a year, on average, with a slightly lower standard deviation of 16.4."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"Add too much, however, and more volatility enters the mix."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"In this case, had 75 percent of the equity stake been invested in the EAFE index and 25 percent in the S.& P. 500, the portfolio would have earned the same 11.4 percent, annualized, from 1970 to 2005."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,But the portfolio's volatility would have shot up to 19.1.
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"This shows that while the global markets may be moving more in sync, ''the world markets aren't completely integrated yet,'' said James D. Peterson, vice president of the Schwab Center for Investment Research in San Francisco."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,Consider the recent performance of foreign and domestic blue chips.
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"Over the last five years, the average foreign large-blend fund returned 13.8 percent a year, on average, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund tracker, as many foreign economies have grown faster than that of the United States and as the dollar has weakened of late."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"By comparison, domestic large-cap blend funds advanced only 6.3 percent a year, on average, during this stretch."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"And last year, foreign blue-chip funds soared 25.1 percent, beating the returns of domestic blue-chip funds by more than 10 percentage points."
2,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"Arguably, much of the investor interest in foreign blue chips can be attributed to their outperformance, not to their similarities to their domestic counterparts."
4,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"''A lot of people just want to be exposed to foreign because it's been doing so well,'' said Ronald W. Rogé, a financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y. ''It's performance chasing.''"
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"To be sure, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the EAFE index has been 0.8 over the last three years, according to Morningstar."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"On paper, that is fairly high, because a correlation of 1.0 implies that two assets are moving in perfect tandem."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"But consider that over this same stretch, the correlation between the S.& P. 500 and the Russell 2000 index of small domestic stocks was actually greater, 0.83, according to Morningstar."
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,Yet investors take it on faith that large-cap and small-cap stocks are entirely different asset classes.
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,There are several reasons for continuing to treat foreign and domestic blue-chip stocks separately.
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"''A big reason is the issue of currency,'' Mr. Peterson said."
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"Investors who put money to work in a foreign market should consider that market's volatility, as well as that of the currency in which its stocks trade."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"In 2006, the EAFE index rose 13.8 percent when measured in local currencies, according to MSCI."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"But for Americans to make an investment abroad, money must first be converted from dollars to those local currencies to buy the securities."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"And when it comes time to sell, the money has to be reconverted back into dollars."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"In dollar terms, the EAFE index actually returned much more last year: 23.5 percent."
3,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,That is because the dollar lost value against the euro.
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,A weakening dollar is a tailwind for Americans investing abroad because each share of their foreign stock becomes worth that much more in dollars.
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,SO isn't this good news for domestic investors?
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,It certainly was last year.
8,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"But what happens if the dollar turns around this year and appreciates, as it did in 2005?"
8,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"In that case, investors could see a big chunk of their foreign stock market gains evaporate -- even if the global stock markets are highly correlated -- simply because the dollar gained value."
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"This is one reason that investors should always assess several factors in the risk and return of a particular stock, said Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a principal in the investment counseling and research department at the Vanguard Group."
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"These include its industry, its value or growth orientation, its market cap and the region where it operates."
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"''While issues of style and cap size are always important, in many cases they would be secondary to geographic regions,'' Mr. Kinniry said, because stocks will always be affected by their regional economies and local currencies."
1,When Those Blue Chips Aren’t Made in the U.S.A.,"In other words, while geography may not be as important a subject as it used to be for investors, it is still one to be studied."

8,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,And in the coming months he will face his first major test: taking on the Applebee's International restaurant chain in a proxy fight.
3,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"Mr. Breeden's fledgling advocacy hedge fund, Breeden Partners, which owns a 5.2 percent stake in Applebee's, began its battle last month, when Mr. Breeden nominated four close friends to its board."
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"Hedge funds, the lucrative private investment pools for institutions like endowments and pensions, and for the wealthy, are nearly always managed by former Wall Street traders or money managers."

1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,Some in the business are skeptical.
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"''I guess I wonder, how does a guy with no investment management experience run a hedge fund?''"
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"asked Philip Goldstein of Bulldog Investors, which runs hedge funds similar in style and intent to that of Mr. Breeden."
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"''You get the guys leaving Goldman Sachs and raising $2 billion, but this is even more astonishing -- he doesn't have a track record.''"
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,Mr. Goldstein added that ''it's kind of like starting at the top -- you'd think you'd want to work at a hedge fund for a while.''
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"But what Mr. Breeden may lack in investing experience, he makes up for in other ways, according to his friends, who cite his hard-driving nature, his intellect, his attention to detail and his decisiveness, if marred at times by a divalike attitude."
4,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"''If it's a bad idea, Richard will kick it down the toilet and flush,'' said Laurence E. Harris, a lawyer in Washington who is one of four close friends that Mr. Breeden nominated last month to the board of directors at Applebee's, with a view to gaining a say in how the company is run."
4,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"Mr. Breeden ''knows what to look for,'' Mr. Harris said."
4,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"''He's a lot less likely to be fooled than a lot of people who are pure investors, because he understands the mechanics of corporate governance and securities laws.''"
3,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"Mr. Breeden, 57, declined to comment for this article."
5,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"He has not only has a new professional life, but a new personal one as well."

1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,Mr. Breeden is now perhaps the most senior former government official ever to run a hedge fund.
5,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,Mr. Breeden oversaw the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1989 to 1993.
5,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"He then ran one of the world's largest accounting firms, Coopers & Lybrand, before establishing his private firm, Richard C. Breeden & Company, in Greenwich, Conn., to advise companies hobbled by ethics and governance problems."
5,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"In recent years, he has served as the high-profile outside monitor for scandal-plagued firms like WorldCom, which filed for bankruptcy in 2002 and Conrad Black's former company, Hollinger International."
2,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"It was when he was overseeing the bankruptcy of WorldCom, later MCI, that Mr. Breeden first began thinking about starting a hedge fund, according to friends and associates."
4,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"Seeing the roles played by the Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim Helú and Mark Neporent of the hedge fund Cerberus Capital as investors in MCI, he asked Mr. Harris, ''I'm thinking of starting a hedge fund -- what do you think?''"

3,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,Mr. Quamme did not return calls requesting comment.
5,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"An entrepreneur as well as an investor, Mr. Quamme has picked some winners in his past jobs, including a chain of video stores that was sold to Blockbuster Video early last decade and a chunk of the Einstein Brothers Bagels franchises."
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"Mr. Quamme, whom Mr. Breeden also nominated to serve on the Applebee's board, has also endured some setbacks."
5,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"His 50 percent stake in Boston Chicken, through Mayfair Partners, an investing partnership that he ran in the mid-1990s, went stale in 1998 when the restaurant and the partnership both filed for bankruptcy."
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"It is, of course, far too early to tell whether Mr. Breeden's knowledge and experience will make his hedge fund, whose philosophy is to invest in American companies with fixable problems in policy and governance, a winner."
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,Some analysts do not see his fund making an impact on Applebee's.
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"''We do not see a dramatic shift near-term in the company's strategic direction that would lead to the 'value creating' programs proposed by the activist,'' Andrew Barish, an analyst with Banc of America Securities wrote earlier this month."
3,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,Applebee's declined to comment on Mr. Breeden's proposals.
3,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"The fund sought to raise $1.25 billion but has so far brought in only around $500 million, including $400 million from Calpers, the California pension fund."
5,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"The hedge fund earned 7.73 percent in the third quarter of 2006, according to the most recent available data from Calpers."
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"To some, Mr. Breeden's leap into the hedge fund business on the heels of serving as a court-appointed monitor for so many large companies raises questions."
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,"''It's an appearances problem, and it bothers me,'' said Michael Feiner, an ethics professor at Columbia Business School, adding that he thought government officials should be required to wait two years before working at hedge funds or lobbying groups."
1,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,''I'm disappointed that he is doing this.''
3,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,Mr. Breeden's spokesmen declined to answer questions on whether Breeden Partners would prohibit itself from investing in companies for which Mr. Breeden had served as a court-appointed monitor.
8,From Ethics Overseer to Hedge Fund Boss,And the transparency that Mr. Breeden championed at the troubled companies he has overseen may go by the wayside with his new venture.

1,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,Managers sometimes welcome active shareholders because it gives them an opportunity to push for changes.
3,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,"But senior executives are also being pressured to deliver shareholder returns as the investment base of companies shifts from passive institutional investors with longer-term horizons to hedge funds focused on the short term, sometimes holding as little as a 1 percent stake in a company."
3,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,"Activism was further fueled by a realization among shareholders that selling shares, often at a loss, to protest unsuccessful management did not really change anything."
3,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,It simply meant the investment was now weighing on someone else's portfolio as the company continued to underperform.

3,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,Analysts say shareholder activism is also focusing on a growing distrust of senior management that can be traced back to corporate scandals like those at Enron and Parmalat.
1,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,"There is a general tendency that ''if there is a problem with the company, shareholders will say, 'Let's do something about it ourselves and don't trust the directors to do so,' '' said Roger Lawson, communications director for the UK Shareholders' Association."
3,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,"Encouraged by the success of activist investors, traditional asset management firms like Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund company in the world, and Templeton, which never made public statements about their investments in the past, also became more vocal and in some instances publicly threw their weight behind an activist hedge fund."
8,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,"Henderson Global Investors, a 73-year-old British asset management firm, is planning later this year to set up an ''active engagement fund'' to look for undervalued companies, buy a stake in them and work together with the management to improve performance and enhance shareholder value."
1,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,"Even though shareholder activism is generally considered to be positive because it makes companies more efficient and increases shareholder returns, some analysts said that the focus on short-term returns can mean important long-term goals were neglected."
1,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,"Under pressure to perform, managers may feel forced to come up with short-term fixes for problems that would otherwise require more time to solve, said Mr. Brooks of Grant Thornton."
1,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,"But Mr. Borges at the European Corporate Governance Institute said these would remain exceptions because it was in the interest of short-term investors to sell their shares at a profit, and they could do so only if they found new investors who believed in the long-term potential of the revamped company."
1,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,"Despite the possible high returns, shareholder activism remains hard work."
1,Boards Feel the Heat as Investor Activists Speak Up,"Just how hard is illustrated by the retirement plans of Mr. de Vries, who after 18 years of fighting for shareholders' rights decided to leave the Dutch shareholder group in October."

1,"Cigna deal gets antitrust nod, positive sign for CVS/Aetna",Wall Street analysts had expected antitrust approval as the companies have little overlap in their businesses.
1,"Cigna deal gets antitrust nod, positive sign for CVS/Aetna",The decision bodes well for the pending U.S. antitrust review of CVS Health Corp’s (CVS.N) proposed $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N.
3,"Cigna deal gets antitrust nod, positive sign for CVS/Aetna",The new company will marry Cigna’s business of managing health plans for corporations and the government with Express Scripts’ (ESRX.O) role handling pharmacy benefits for those same customers.

1,"Cigna deal gets antitrust nod, positive sign for CVS/Aetna",The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has said it is looking at how so-called industry middlemen and pharmacies such as Express Scripts and CVS impact drug costs for U.S. consumers.
8,"Cigna deal gets antitrust nod, positive sign for CVS/Aetna",The administration is looking at implementing a rule that could change or eliminate the use of rebates from drugmakers to PBMs that critics say contribute to higher drug prices.
3,"Cigna deal gets antitrust nod, positive sign for CVS/Aetna",Cigna and Express Scripts said they have already obtained clearances for the deal from departments of insurance in 16 states and are working with regulators in remaining jurisdictions to obtain clearance for the merger.

1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),But some strategists caution that it may be wiser to try to benefit indirectly from a weaker dollar -- by holding stocks or stock funds focused on certain industries and countries -- than by betting directly on foreign currencies.

3,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"In 2006, the dollar fell 10.2 percent against the euro and 12 percent against the British pound, although it rose 1.1 percent against the Japanese yen."
1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"Mr. Stovall said the best move for most individual investors would be to stock up on the shares of American multinational corporations that earn a lot of their revenues abroad, as well as on foreign stocks."
8,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"''We feel that many foreign economies are not as far along in their economic cycle, and they have good growth potential now,'' he said."
1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"He recommended that individual investors allocate 40 percent of their total portfolios to domestic stocks, 20 percent to foreign stocks, 25 percent to domestic bonds and 15 percent to cash instruments like money market accounts and certificates of deposit."
1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"In terms of domestic stocks, he favors large stocks like those in the S.& P. 500- stock index."
3,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"On average, the companies in this index earn 41 percent of their revenue in foreign countries."
8,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"''If you believe that international economies are going to do fairly well, and the dollar is likely to weaken,'' Mr. Stovall said, ''then you could get a good bit of tailwind if you transfer those foreign profits back to U.S."

1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"''You have to be a little bit concerned that emerging-markets debt and equity may have gotten a bit ahead of themselves,'' he said."
8,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),Mr. Schweitzer said that any further appreciation of the euro could be modest this year.
1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"Still, he added, European stocks were appealing investments for a host of other reasons."
3,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"He pointed out that the average dividend yield in the S.& P. 500 index was now 1.8 percent, compared with 3.2 percent for the MSCI United Kingdom index and 2.5 percent for the MSCI Europe index, excluding Britain."
8,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"For Americans investing in Britain or on the continent, a further slide by the dollar against the pound or the euro could bolster those dividend advantages."

3,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"Earnings per share for European stocks, he said, grew almost twice as fast in the first five years of this decade as they did during the last five years of the 1990s."
8,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"On the fixed-income side of their portfolios, some investors may be tempted to profit directly from a falling dollar by buying foreign bonds or CDs."
1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"But Martin J. Mauro, the fixed-income strategist at Merrill Lynch, said he didn't think the time was ripe for investing in foreign bonds."
8,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"Interest rates are likely to fall in the United States this year but rise in many other countries, Mr. Mauro said."
1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"Bond prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates, so both European and Asian bonds would generally be unattractive for American investors, he said."
0,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),Many economists predict that the dollar will fall further against the Japanese yen than it will against the euro -- largely because the dollar rose slightly against the yen in 2006.

3,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"Short-term interest rates are less than 1 percent in Japan, versus 5 percent in the United States."
0,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),And Mr. Mauro said he expected the dollar to fall by only an additional 1 percent or so against the euro -- which he said wouldn't be quite enough to make up for the yield that Americans would sacrifice by buying European bonds or CDs.
3,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"One-year government bills in the United States currently pay around 5 percent, versus 3.9 percent in Germany."
1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"For now, he recommends high-quality domestic bonds."
1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"He said typical individual investors should put at most 5 percent of their bond portfolios into high-yield bonds, and none into emerging-market debt."
8,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"Although short-term rates are relatively high, he recommends intermediate maturities -- 5 to 15 years -- because he expects domestic interest rates to be lower next year."
8,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"''If we're right, and the economy weakens and the Fed cuts rates, then what investors will earn on short-term rates will be a lot less next year,'' he said."
1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"''It's a tough move to make now, but they'll be better off a year from now'' if they buy longer-maturity bonds or CDs today."
1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"FINALLY, if investors are really worried about the dollar, Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, advises them to put about 5 percent of their portfolios into gold."
1,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),He recommends buying the metal through an exchange-traded fund like StreetTracks Gold Shares or the iShares Comex Gold Trust -- both of which are backed by bars of gold in a vault.
8,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"He predicted that gold could rise as much as 20 percent in 2007, to around $750 an ounce."
8,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),"A falling dollar, Mr. Metz said, may prompt foreign central banks to sell some their dollar reserves to buy gold."
8,How to Catch a Falling Dollar (and Even Make a Profit),He also said that rising incomes across Asia could become a factor.

2,German intelligence chief promoted after controversial Chemnitz comments - Xinhua,The decision to relieve Maasen of his duties as president of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) and instead offer him the better salaried position as secretary of state for interior- and cyber security was reached during an emergency cabinet session.
8,German intelligence chief promoted after controversial Chemnitz comments - Xinhua,"Earlier, the German Social Democrats (SPD) had threatened to quit the ""grand coalition"", formed together with the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), unless Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) personally ensured that Maasen was sacked by Wednesday."
3,German intelligence chief promoted after controversial Chemnitz comments - Xinhua,"The previously-little known national intelligence services executive, the former BfV president, has recently sparked heated public debate in Germany by questioning the authenticity of a video footage in which right-wing extremists were seen chasing and accosting stereotypically foreign-looking civilians on the streets of Chemnitz."
3,German intelligence chief promoted after controversial Chemnitz comments - Xinhua,"In doing so, Maasen directly contradicted chancellor Merkel and local security officers on the issue before backtracking on the statement in question during a subsequent report."
1,German intelligence chief promoted after controversial Chemnitz comments - Xinhua,"As a consequence, senior SPD politicians complained that the uncertainty created by Maasen and the resulting impetus provided to online conspiracy theories, as well as a growing impression that the BfV president has personal sympathies for the far-right, rendered him unsuitable for the task of protecting the German constitution."
3,German intelligence chief promoted after controversial Chemnitz comments - Xinhua,"Maasen has previously already been accused of offering clandestine advice to the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on how to prevent its monitoring by the BfV, a claim he vigorously denies."

1,German intelligence chief promoted after controversial Chemnitz comments - Xinhua,"CDU leader Merkel, CSU leader Seehofer and SPD leader Andrea Nahles described Maasen's promotion as a sensible compromise which would ensure the continued existence of the ""grand coalition"" and thus enable the federal government to return to its regular work."
1,German intelligence chief promoted after controversial Chemnitz comments - Xinhua,"However, the unusual personnel decision in response to widespread allegations of inappropriate behavior was met with a wave of criticism in the German media, the ruling parties themselves and the opposition."
1,German intelligence chief promoted after controversial Chemnitz comments - Xinhua,"The magazine ""SPIEGEL"" wrote that the final outcome and way in which a decision was reached in the affair offered an ""exemplary case of how to promote frustration with politics."""
8,German intelligence chief promoted after controversial Chemnitz comments - Xinhua,"SPD vice-president Ralf Stegner similarly told the German press agency (dpa) on Wednesday that the development was a ""disaster"" which would cause support in his party for a continuation of the ""grand coalition"" to fall even further to dangerously low levels."
8,German intelligence chief promoted after controversial Chemnitz comments - Xinhua,"For Kevin Kuehnert, the leader of the SPD youth organization (Juso) and one of the most outspoken critics of Merkel, Seehofer and Maasen, the time has come for the party to exit Merkel's fourth ruling cabinet."

1,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,The sessions stood in stark contrast to the bipartisan meetings Mr. Bush held with lawmakers on Friday.
1,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,Senators attending those sessions said that Mr. Bush was careful not to reveal his thinking about whether he was committed to the plan to increase troops.
1,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,"By Monday, though, he made his intentions clear."
1,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,"''It was clear that he has thought long and hard about this change in strategy,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who supports the troop increase."

0,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,White House officials were still planning details of the speech on Monday.
3,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,"The president's aides were contemplating having Mr. Bush deliver it from the White House Map Room, a site replete with the history and imagery of World War II -- imagery that Mr. Bush has invoked as he has sought to compare the campaign against terrorism to the struggle against totalitarianism and the Nazis."

3,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,"At the White House, Mr. Bush told skeptical senators that he came away from a recent meeting in Jordan with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq persuaded that Mr. Maliki was committed to moving toward national reconciliation."

1,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,"''I expressed reservations,'' Ms. Snowe said."
1,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,"''I said, 'Why should we expect any different result than previously,' that I didn't believe the Maliki government had demonstrated the political will or capacity or resoluteness for reconciliation, that the reason Americans are not supporting the war is because they see Iraqis fighting among themselves rather than for themselves, and I didn't see the surge addressing the root causes of the violence.''"
8,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,"Mr. Smith, who delivered a speech on the Senate floor before Christmas saying he was at the end of his rope on Iraq, said: ''What this sets up is a classic war powers confrontation between the White House and the Congress."
1,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,Clearly he has the powers to commit troops; the question is whether the Congress has the convictions to deny funding.''
1,White House Gears Up to Sell Plan for Troop Increase in Iraq,"The senator said he, for one, does not have the appetite for that."

0,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,(Reuters) - Local TV companies such as Sinclair Broadcast Group (SBGI.O) and Gray Television (GTN.N) are set for a significant political advertising boost this year as candidates and special interest groups are spending heavily to woo voters in mid-term elections.

0,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"Demand for commercial airtime is particularly strong ahead of elections for one third of the U.S. Senate seats, and all 435 House of Representatives seats as well as positions such as state governorships, because U.S. President Donald Trump’s Republican party is fighting to keep its majority in both houses of Congress while Democrats are battling to turn the tables."
3,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,Politicians and their supporters from both political parties are looking to win voters with their stances on hot button issues such as gun control and abortion rights.
1,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"“There’s a lot of excitement and probably a lot of paranoia and a lot of fear, and those things drive political dollars,” Kevin Latek, chief legal and development officer at Gray Television, told investors on Tuesday, according to a conference call transcript."
3,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"Gray posted second-quarter political ad revenue of $18.1 million, 20 percent above the high end of its forecast and 9 percent above the same quarter in 2014, the last mid-term election year."
2,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"Political ads brought about 7 percent of total second-quarter revenue at Gray, which forecast a third-quarter range of $41 million to $45 million for the segment versus $41 million in 2014."
8,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"After reporting bumper second-quarter political revenue on Wednesday, Sinclair raised its 2018 target for the segment to $160 million from a range of $140 million to $150 million."
8,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"The new target would be 5.8 percent of total revenue, according to analyst estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters data."
1,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"Of course the momentum could change as 80 percent of political ad spending typically occurs between the start of September and election day, which is Nov. 6 this year."
8,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,But analysts are hopeful the early strength will continue.
8,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"“It looks like its going to be a record year even without a Presidential race,” said Daniel Kurnos an analyst covering broadcasters at Benchmark Company."
5,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"For 2018, political advertising could generate $2.4 billion revenue for local broadcasters compared with $2.1 billion in 2014, according to Kantar Media CMAG unit’s latest forecast issued in 2017."

5,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"The 2016 U.S. presidential election generated $2.85 billion for local broadcasters, according to Passwaiter."
5,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,The presidential race tends to attract more advertising dollars than local mid-term battles but 2016 spending was much weaker than expected as Trump relied far more on free media than past candidates.

1,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,The amount a broadcaster generates varies a lot in election years as it depends on how many of their stations serve battleground states where campaigns spend heavily in a particular year for reasons such as close polls.
1,U.S. broadcasters in line for political ad windfall,"Also, strong demand for political commercials tends to eat into core advertising revenue from clients like carmakers as broadcasters only have a finite number of timeslots, said Leo Kulp, analyst at RBC Capital Management."

5,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,"The 1995 budget fight grew out of the push by Republicans -- riding their historic House takeover the year before -- for cuts in federal spending, with Medicare as their poster child for a bloated federal program."
5,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,"When Mr. Clinton refused to go along with trimming the program, budget talks collapsed, and the resulting 21-day shutdown put nearly 300,000 federal workers on furlough and disrupted public services."
5,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,"Republicans were outmaneuvered in that battle, and found that the public blamed them for a shutdown of federal agencies."

1,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,"One difference with 1995 was that in that episode, there was tangible fallout for Americans as parks and museums closed, benefit checks were delayed and an array of federal assistance was suspended."

1,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,But Democrats say that Mr. Bush is operating in an atmosphere of deep skepticism and that he must fight his own low poll numbers as well as public frustration with the war -- even though a recent survey showed a slight gain in optimism about Iraq.
1,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,"''We have had a chance to study 1995, and Democrats are bound and determined to make sure it won't happen to them,'' said Jim Manley, a spokesman for Senator Harry Reid, the majority leader."
1,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,''Here we have a president seriously at odds with the American people.''
1,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,"Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the current chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and a senior aide in the Clinton administration, said Mr. Bush was retracing the missteps of Mr. Gingrich, courting conflict, while Mr. Clinton displayed a willingness to compromise."

1,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,"Indeed, the White House has drawn a hard line, saying it will not legitimize a Democratic withdrawal plan of any sort by accepting it as part of legislation."
1,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,"Two Democrats said that Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, urged Mr. Bush to work with Democrats on the war while the two mingled in her office before a Capitol Rotunda ceremony last week; the Democrats said that Mr. Bush's reply was essentially, ''I am where I am.''"
3,Tussle Over Iraq Bill Reminds Many of Bitter 1995,Both sides are trying to exploit openings.

0,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"LONDON, Nov. 16 (Xinhua) -- As British Prime Minister Theresa May appointed replacements Friday for the two front-bench ministers who quit this week, a leading expert in politics predicted she only stood a 50-50 chance of winning a challenge to her leadership."
1,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,Professor Philip Cowley from Queen Mary University of London said those odds of success for her reign at 10 Downing Street are not such a good position for her to be in.
3,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"As political commentators and parliamentary correspondents in London eagerly waited to see if a challenge to May emerges, the prime minster was busy at Number 10 hiring two new ministers to take over from Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Works and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey who quit this week from their government roles."
1,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,Both said they could not support the Brexit agreement agreed this week by the majority of May's cabinet.
3,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"Amber Rudd, who served as Home Secretary, essentially Britain's top interior minister, was brought back into the cabinet to succeed McVey."
3,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"Raab, who only took over the Brexit hot seat in July after the first holder of the post, David Davis, resigned, was succeeded by a politician relatively known outside the so-called Westminster bubble."
1,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,Health Minister Stephen Barclay was appointed to what political commentator described as the government job no politician wanted.
5,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"Former banker Barclay, who supported Britain leaving the European Union in the 2016 referendum, was appointed to the House of Commons in 2010, representing a constituency on Cambridgeshire."
3,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,The main attention remained focused firmly on May with reports that the number of names needed to trigger a vote of no confidence in her had reached the minimum 48 required.
3,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"In what is a highly secretive procedure, an announcement of a vote will be made at some stage, and result in a vote among the more than 300 Conservative MPs."
8,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,Professor Cowley believes a no-confidence move could even give May a boost if she wins the vote among Conservative MPs who sit in the House of Commons.
8,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"""Even if she wins by one vote it would mean she could not be challenged again for a year,"" he said."
8,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"Cowley, a political scientist, who has co-authored a new book, The British General Election of 2017, said if May lost the vote, or decided to step down if she won only by an insignificant margin, there would have to be a leadership contest to elect a new leader and prime minister, causing a delay of several weeks to the Brexit roller-coaster."
8,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"May, he said, could be strengthened by the party's own rules which would prevent a second challenge for at least a year."
1,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"""It would immediately mean that attack would disappear."
1,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"At the moment May is facing a battle on two flanks, one in parliament and the other within her own Conservative Party."
8,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"""If she won the vote of confidence by a big enough margin to carry on, and there has been talk of her winning by around 100, she would be at least able not to have to worry about another challenge from her own MPs."""
2,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"Cowley said one problem for May could be Conservative MPs who had not wanted a challenge in the first place, but who had doubts about her leadership, deciding that this would be their one chance to seek a new party leader."
0,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"""My own hunch is that this would be a 50-50 chance of her winning this, and that is not a good position for a prime minister to be in."""
8,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"But Cowley said May, or a successor, would have to steer the Brexit measures through the British Parliament with one possible outcome a confidence vote."
8,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"That, said Cowley, could see the Conservative government collapsing with a general election early in 2019 -- possibly around January or February."
8,UK PM only stands 50-50 chance of winning confidence vote: political scientist - Xinhua,"Such an election could, he said, see Labour's Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister of a minority government, bidding to negotiate a Brexit deal or an extension to the Article 50 process that started the ball rolling in the first place to end Britain's EU membership."

1,U.S. Cites Indian Government Agencies in Weapons Conspiracy,"The charges, coming just months after Congress approved President Bush's plan to ship American nuclear reactors and fuel to India, could prove to be a diplomatic embarrassment for the administration, which has made cementing closer ties with India a top foreign policy priority."

3,"As Philippines' Duterte starts to flag, his daughter reaches out to a Marcos","That contrasts sharply from his 40-year-old daughter, who has started maneuvering to build alliances and expand her small party in the southern Davao region into a new political juggernaut, as fissures appear in her father’s ruling PDP-Laban party."
3,"As Philippines' Duterte starts to flag, his daughter reaches out to a Marcos","She was instrumental in bringing together political factions to stage a dramatic July 23 ousting of divisive Duterte ally Pantaleon Alvarez as lower house speaker, replacing him with veteran Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, 71, a former president with clout and connections to ensure support for Duterte and his agenda."
3,"As Philippines' Duterte starts to flag, his daughter reaches out to a Marcos","The move was helped by a relationship developing between Sara Duterte and Imee Marcos, 62, a provincial governor and key figure in the still influential family of late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who ruled the Philippines for two decades before being ousted in a 1986 uprising."

0,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"TOKYO, Sept. 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, winning the ruling party's leadership election Thursday, will likely to become Japan's longest-serving leader, but underwhelming support shown by rank-and-file party members may spell difficulties ahead for both party and president, political analysts said."
3,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"In the leadership race, Abe's only opponent was former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba who in the run-up to the election voiced different views to Abe on constitutional reform and economic policies and ended up mounting a far-bigger challenge to the incumbent than expected."
1,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"Local political observers pointed out that while Abe has secured the top party post for a third-consecutive term, effectively ensuring his position as the nation's next prime minister owing to the ruling coalition's majorities in both chambers of parliament, Ishiba garnering far more support than expected from rank-and-file members has certainly raised some red flags looking ahead."
2,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"While Abe won 329 out of ballots cast by Diet members, and 224 by rank-and-file members, Ishiba secured 73 votes from legislators but an unexpected 181 votes from ordinary members, who closely reflect public opinion."
1,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"This, political analysts said, was to a certain extent down to increasing opposition to the prime minister's long reign amid ongoing cronyism allegations, ineffectual economic policies and the railroading through parliament of contentious legislation, including those related to security, to push forward his constitutional reform agenda."
1,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"The underwhelming support in the leadership election, described by political watchers here as a ""backlash"" by the LDP's rank-and-file members, is ""most certainly"" reflected in public opinion, specialists in politics and national ideology have maintained."
1,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"""People have begun to feel weary of slogan-only and deceptive politics and Abe's style of the privatized use of public power and hawkish stance toward diplomacy and East Asian international relations,"" Dr. Shin Chiba, professor with Special Appointment, who specializes in political theory, said."
8,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"Abe, following his victory, was quick to reiterate his plans to forge ahead with his career goal of revising the nation's Supreme Law for the first time since World War II, having controversially and against public and constitutional experts' opinions redefined the role of the Self-Defense Forces (SDF) three years ago, to allow it to take part in collective-self defense and come to the aid of an ally under attack, even if its own territory is not threatened."
8,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"Henceforth, Abe will thus seek to secure the two-thirds majority needed in both houses of parliament and a majority in a national referendum to bring about his legacy-led revisions to the constitution, which will specifically make reference to the SDF and ""purportedly"" clear up its current constitutional ambiguity."
1,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"However, as recent polls have suggested, the Japanese public are far more concerned about the dire fiscal health of the nation, rather than the prime minister's singular goal of revising the Supreme Law for the first time since it took effect in 1947."
1,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,Abe's reasons for constitutional reform are both personal and political.
1,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"He is a long-time devotee of constitutional reform and has used geopolitical pretexts to push forward his reforms, noted Tina Burrett, Associate Professor of Political Science at Sophia University."
1,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"""The public are split on the issue of reform... for most voters, however, the economy and public services are far more important issues,"" she said."
1,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"Her sentiments have been echoed by other experts on the matter, with Yu Uchiyama, a political scientist at the University of Tokyo, believing Abe's constitutional agenda is far from a straightforward one, with a public mandate on the issue possibly going awry."
8,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"""Even if Abe manages to force a revision through parliament, he would face a referendum, raising the prospect of a Brexit-style political meltdown if the people vote against him,"" Uchiyama said."
1,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"With public support for the premier and his Cabinet tepid at best amid myriad cronyism scandals and economic malaise perpetrated by a vastly unclear blueprint as to how to deal with the nation's ballooning social welfare costs related to its rapidly aging and shrinking society, security issues are currently not a public priority, political experts have attested."
1,News Analysis: Bumpy road ahead for Japan's Abe following rank-and-file backlash in LDP leadership vote - Xinhua,"Christian Collet, from International Christian University's Politics and International Relations faculty maintained that the Japanese populace believe that Article 9 of Japan's pacifist charter, that states that Japanese people forever renounce war and that land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained, despite Abe's aspirations, should remain as is."

1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"For months, Gov."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas and other governors have warned that their state National Guards are ill-prepared for the next local disaster, be it a tornado a flash flood or a terrorist's threat, because of large deployments of their soldiers and equipment in Iraq and Afghanistan."
2,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Then, last Friday night, a deadly tornado all but cleared the small town of Greensburg off the Kansas map."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"With 80 square blocks of the small farming town destroyed, Ms. Sebelius said her fears had come true: The emergency response was too slow, she said, and there was only one reason."
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"''As you travel around Greensburg, you'll see that city and county trucks have been destroyed,'' Ms. Sebelius, a Democrat, said Monday."
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,''The National Guard is one of our first responders.
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"They don't have the equipment they need to come in, and it just makes it that much slower.''"
0,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"For nearly two days after the storm, there was an unmistakable emptiness in Greensburg, a lack of heavy machinery and an army of responders."
0,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"By Sunday afternoon, more than a day and a half after the tornado, only about half of the Guard troops who would ultimately respond were in place."
0,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"It was not until Sunday night that significant numbers of military vehicles started to arrive, many streaming in a long caravan from Wichita about 100 miles away."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Ms. Sebelius's comments about the slow response prompted a debate with the White House on Tuesday, which initially said the fault rested with her."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Tony Snow, the White House press secretary, said the governor should have followed procedure by finding gaps after the storm hit and asking the federal government to fill them -- but did not."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"''If you don't request it, you're not going to get it,'' Mr."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,Snow told reporters on Tuesday morning.
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,The debate was reminiscent of the Bush administration's skirmishes with Gov.
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana, also a Democrat, after Hurricane Katrina."
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"But after an angry flurry of words, both sides seemed to back down a bit later Tuesday."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Ms. Sibelius said she now had enough equipment and personnel to deal with the problems in Greensburg, and the White House acknowledged that the governor had requested several items that the federal government supplied, including a mobile command center, a mobile office building, an urban search and rescue team, and coordination of extra Black Hawk helicopters."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Nonetheless, the governor and officials in other states again expressed concern that the problem could occur again as the stretched National Guard system struggled to respond to disasters at home while also fighting overseas."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"As State Senator Donald Betts Jr., Democrat of Wichita, put it: ''We should have had National Guard troops there right after the tornado hit, securing the place, pulling up debris, to make sure that if there was still life, people could have been saved."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"The response time was too slow, and it's becoming a trend."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"We saw this after Katrina, and it's like history repeating itself.''"
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency, which came under strong criticism after Hurricane Katrina, seemed to respond more quickly in Kansas."
0,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Several of the agency's mobile disaster recovery centers are in Greensburg assisting residents, and the agency said it had moved in 15,000 gallons of water and 21,000 ready-to-eat meals, enough to feed 10,000 people."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,State officials said the problem with the National Guard's response had more to do with equipment than personnel.
2,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"In Kansas, the National Guard is operating with 40 percent to 50 percent of its vehicles and heavy machinery, local Guard officials said."
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Ordinarily, the Guard would have about 660 Humvees and more than 30 large trucks to traverse difficult terrain and transport heavy equipment."
2,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"When the tornado struck, the Guard had about 350 Humvees and 15 large trucks, said Maj. Gen. Tod Bunting, the state's adjutant general."
2,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"The Guard would also usually have 170 medium-scale tactical vehicles used to transport people and supplies -- but now it has fewer than 30, he said."
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"On the other hand, General Bunting said, it had more cargo trucks than it needed."
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,The issue is not confined to Kansas.
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"In Ohio, the National Guard is short of night vision goggles and M-4 rifles, said a Guard spokesman, Dr. Mark Wayda."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"''If we had a tornado hit a small town, we would be fine,'' Dr. Wayda said."
8,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"''If we had a much larger event, that would become a problem.''"
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,The California National Guard is similarly concerned about a catastrophic event.
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"''Our issue is that we are shortchanged when it comes to equipment,'' said Col. Jon Siepmann, a spokesman for the Guard in California."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"''We have gone from a strategic reserve to a globally deployable force, and yet our equipment resources have been largely the same levels since before the war.''"
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"In Arkansas, Gov."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Mike Beebe a Democrat, echoed the concerns of Ms. Sebelius."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"''We have the same problem,'' Mr. Beebe said."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"''We have had a significant decrease in equipment traditionally afforded our National Guard, and it's occasioned by the fact that it's been sent to the Middle East and Iraq.''"
8,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"He added: ''Our first and foremost consideration is to guarantee that our soldiers have the resources, including equipment, to do the job and protect themselves."
8,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Having said that, my preference would be for the federal government to provide that equipment and not strip the state's resources, which could adversely impact the state's mission in times of crisis, which is what happened in Kansas.''"
5,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Last year, all 50 governors signed a letter to President Bush asking for the immediate re-equipping of Guard units sent overseas."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"But officials in several states, including Kentucky, Minnesota and Texas, said Tuesday that they were not facing equipment shortages."
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"National Guard units overseas are often assigned engineering missions, and the skills and equipment -- bulldozers and trucks, for example -- are also what might be required to deal with a natural disaster at home."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"White House officials said that the Kansas National Guard had at its disposal in the Midwest and the Plains states, everything it needed."
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,By Mr.
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Snow's count, that included 83,000 National Guard soldiers; 99 bulldozers; 61 loaders; 246 dump trucks and 59 graders."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"''There's a lot of stuff available,'' Mr."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,Snow said.
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"''So, again, I think this is one where the equipment was available and everybody was moving as rapidly as possible.''"
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"In Congressional testimony, senior National Guard officials have said that since Sept. 11 units under their command had equipment shortages as forces deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan."
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Responding to concerns that the National Guard would not have sufficient personnel or equipment to respond to natural disasters, Guard leaders and state officials developed plans to ensure that if a state is in short supply of people or gear when a hurricane or tornado strikes, it can borrow from other states."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"But borrowing does not solve every problem, state officials said, and coordination can take time."
5,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"The destruction from Hurricane Katrina ultimately required the help of 50,000 troops -- and they came from all 50 states."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,Training is another issue.
5,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"At a Washington news conference in February, Ms. Sebelius said, ''The Guard cannot train on equipment they do not have.''"
5,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"She added later: ''And in a state like Kansas, where tornados, floods, blizzards and wildfires can seemingly happen all at once, we need our Guardsmen to be as prepared as possible.''"
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,Two recent reports have raised questions about Guard preparedness.
3,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"An independent military assessment council, the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves, released a report in March that stated: ''In particular, the equipment readiness of the Army National Guard is unacceptable and has reduced the capability of the United States to respond to current and additional major contingencies, foreign and domestic.''"
5,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Another report, released in January by the Government Accountability Office, concluded that the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have ''significantly decreased'' the amount of equipment available for National Guard units not deployed overseas, while the same units face an increasing number of threats at home."
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"Late Tuesday, in a statement, Ms. Sebelius repeated her message:"
1,Kansas Tornado Renews Debate on Guard at War,"''I have said for nearly two years, and will continue to say, that we have a looming crisis on our hands when it comes to National Guard equipment in Iraq and our needs here at home.''"

2,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"The Road Home, the Louisiana grant program for homeowners who lost their houses to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, is expected to cost far more than the $7.5 billion provided by the federal government, in part because many more families have applied than officials had anticipated."
0,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"As a result, Louisiana officials on Tuesday night set a July 31 deadline for applicants, who can receive up to $150,000 to repair or rebuild their houses."
8,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"With the cutoff date, the state hopes to be able to figure out how much more money it needs to pay for the program; the shortfall is projected to be $2.9 billion."
3,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"The financial woes of the Road Home have set off a frenzy of finger-pointing between federal and state officials, who blame one another for the projected shortfall."
3,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"But it has stirred something close to despair among some Louisiana residents, who were already bemoaning the sluggish way the program has given out the money it does have; only 22,000 families statewide, out of 140,000 applicants, have received grants so far, for a total of $1.3 billion."
1,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"The new problem has reinforced the fears of many in New Orleans that they are being abandoned by the federal government, even as it acknowledges that its levee system failed during Hurricane Katrina."
1,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"''There's no way they can ever make everybody whole, but they need to fix the thing they broke,'' said Frank A. Silvestri, a New Orleans lawyer and co-founder of the Citizens' Road Home Action Team, which has been critical of the program."
3,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,Evidence that the program is likely to run out of money has been building for several weeks as the state has finally begun making a significant number of grants since the inception of the Road Home nine months ago.
2,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"The grants have averaged about $76,000, which is more than the roughly $60,000 the state predicted last August."
2,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,State officials say that many more houses turned out to have had severe damage than federal data indicated back when the program was created.
1,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"They have also been surprised by a recent surge in applications, which are running at several hundred a day, almost two years after the storms, said Gentry Brann, director of communications for the program."
1,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"The state also expected private insurance companies to cover a larger percentage of the damage, said Walter J. Leger Jr., a lawyer and member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which created the Road Home program."
1,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"''Anecdotally, the companies aren't paying,'' Mr. Leger said."
2,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"''National Flood Insurance paid out, but private insurers didn't.''"
3,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,Insurance benefits are generally subtracted from grants awarded by the program.
1,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"But Mr. Leger and other state officials concede that many homeowners may have preferred to try to get larger grants from the Road Home, rather than fight with their insurers."
2,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"The Bush administration contends that the state itself created the shortfall by paying for home damage caused by wind, rather than limiting the program to flood damage."
3,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,Insurance policies are more likely to cover wind damage than flood damage.
2,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"The decision to pay for wind damage added about 43,000 houses to the likely total covered by the program, at a cost of about $2.6 billion, according to data from the office of Donald E. Powell, President Bush's coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding."
1,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"Even so, Mr. Powell ''is not opposed to additional funding -- if the state can make a clear case for more funds,'' his spokeswoman, Susan Aspey, wrote in an e-mail message."
1,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"''He wants to get this resolved as quickly as possible for the people of Louisiana, and he's indicated his willingness to sit down with the governor and her staff to work towards that end.''"
1,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"State officials, from the governor on down, say the program has always covered wind damage, and that they do not understand why Mr. Powell is raising the issue so late in the game."
3,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"The state had a similar run-in with the Department of Housing and Urban Development over the way it paid out the grant money, and ended up changing the program in April."
3,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,Louisiana is also fighting the Federal Emergency Management Agency for more than $1 billion it was counting on for the Road Home program.
3,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,FEMA says it cannot release the money -- intended for hazard-mitigation efforts like elevating houses -- because the Road Home discriminates against younger people by exempting people 65 and older from a requirement that grant recipients live in their rebuilt houses for three years.
3,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"Further complicating the financial picture is the fact that the state treasury is running a budget surplus of about $3 billion, which some in Washington have argued should be used to bail out the Road Home."
8,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"A United States Senate subcommittee that held a hearing on the program last week is likely to recommend ways to fix it in a report to be released in June, said Stephanie Allen, a spokeswoman for Senator Mary L. Landrieu, the Louisiana Democrat who is chairwoman of the subcommittee."
1,Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims,"''She doesn't think the federal government should be responsible for the entire bailout,'' Ms. Allen said."

2,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,"The new superintendent, Paul G. Vallas, who is credited with changes in school systems in Chicago and, most recently, in Philadelphia, was chosen to take on what is seen as one of the more singular challenges in American education: creating a working school district where many of the buildings are ruined, many of the teachers are missing and thousands of students might return suddenly."
1,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,"When they do, they will be among the neediest -- the poorest and lowest-achieving -- in the nation."
3,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,"As a superintendent in Philadelphia and Chicago, Mr. Vallas raised test scores with the help of after-school programs, new schools and revised curricula."
3,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,He is generally regarded by schools experts as one of the more energetic practitioners in the field.
1,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,"But speaking Friday in a shuttered school in the Lower Ninth Ward, he seemed to recognize the special difficulty of this task."

1,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,''Why this job at this time?''
1,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,Mr. Vallas said.

1,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,"Clearly the hurricane has done damage, but there has been neglect'' even before the storm."
2,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,"Mr. Vallas comes to a school district that has followed a tortuous path because of the hurricane and a storm of academic, financial and administrative problems it had before that: a revolving door of superintendents, millions in misspent federal money and test scores that were the lowest in the state."
5,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,"Because of those difficulties, the state took over the district after the hurricane in 2005."

3,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,"Mr. Vallas was chief executive for the school district in Philadelphia and earned generally high marks for his academic achievements, though a budget shortfall of $73 million cast a cloud over his tenure."
3,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,"He more than doubled fifth-grade math proficiency after arriving there in 2002, though gains in reading and in high school measures were smaller."
5,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,"In Chicago, where he was in charge of the schools from 1995 to 2001, similar gains were made."
1,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,The success or failure of the school district in New Orleans is widely seen as an important symbol of the city's recovery.
8,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,The challenge will be different from those Mr. Vallas has faced previously: more than half of fourth graders at nine schools in the district recently surveyed by Louisiana State University were below grade level in reading.
3,Prominent Education Reformer to Lead New Orleans Schools,"At two schools, every fourth grader was below grade level in math."

0,THE WEEK; Towns Seek Flood-Prevention Solutions,"Other public officials around the state are showing similar determination, with a number of communities hit hard by the storm resurrecting old projects with renewed vigor."
0,THE WEEK; Towns Seek Flood-Prevention Solutions,"And in places where flood mitigation work was done, officials are using the storm as a test to determine whether they need to reassess."

2,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,President Pervez Musharraf acknowledged Thursday for the first time that the Pakistani military had been involved in the recent heavy fighting in the tribal area of South Waziristan and said that nearly 300 foreign militants had been killed.
2,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,"The commander of Pakistani troops in the tribal areas, Maj. Gen. Gul Muhammad, put the figure much lower, at 150 to 200, in a briefing for journalists in Wana, the main town of South Waziristan, on Wednesday."

8,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,"The military does appear to have gained more control in the immediate region of Wana, and General Muhammad said the progress made in clearing the area of foreign militants -- mainly Uzbeks and other Central Asians who have been allied with Al Qaeda -- would serve as a model to use in the rest of the region, including the equally lawless North Waziristan next door."
2,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,"Pakistan has been under heavy pressure from the United States and NATO countries to contain the spreading lawlessness of its tribal areas which Pakistani, Afghan and foreign militants have been using to wage an expanding insurgency across the border in Afghanistan."
3,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,South Waziristan had become a Taliban state in all but name after a peace deal with militants in 2005 gave them freedom to operate while the military withdrew to its barracks.
3,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,The Pakistani military abandoned broad-scale military operations in favor of negotiated peace deals with the militants over the past two years.

1,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,"Even as it explains the recent developments as a homegrown uprising, the government is claiming credit for the shift in tribal dynamics as a result of its three-pronged strategy, referred to by General Muhammad as coercive deployment, political engagement and socio-economic development, to ''win over the hearts and minds of the people.''"
1,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,Yet it remains unclear whether all is as the military says.
3,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,Promised meetings with members of the political administration of South Waziristan and with tribal elders did not materialize on the journalists' visit to the region Wednesday.
3,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,"And while the military has tried to depict the fighting as local tribespeople moving against the foreigners, in fact it has been led by a Pakistani Taliban commander, Maulavi Nazir, who has close links to the Afghan Taliban and Arab members of Al Qaeda."
1,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,"One of his accusations against the Uzbek group of militants has been that they did not want to fight foreign troops in Afghanistan, but preferred to attack pro-American Pakistanis, whether tribal elders or government members."
1,Pakistani Army Says Its Forces Are Gaining in Tribal Lands,"Answering a volley of questions regarding Mr. Nazir, General Muhammad said only that the militant commander was subservient to his tribe and not above it."

5,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"WHILE Hurricane Wilma was ravaging this plutocrats' playground with sustained winds of 110 miles an hour on Oct. 24, 2005, Mario Nievera, Palm Beach's leading landscape architect, was in Pennsylvania, putting on a brave face as he delivered a lecture about his work to the Philadelphia Garden Club."
5,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"As Mr. Nievera showed slides of his more exquisite creations -- purple bougainvillea wrapped around coconut palms and allées of guava trees -- the plants themselves were being ripped to shreds by Wilma, which would ultimately cause $12.2 billion worth of property damage to Florida."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,Having struggled for more than a year to revive gardens destroyed in September 2004 by Hurricane Frances -- the most destructive storm to hit the town since 1947 -- Mr. Nievera was daunted at having to start all over again.
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Although he stood to profit mightily, he dreaded the added stress."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"In the wake of Wilma, he said in mid-January, ''there's twice as much work, on top of all our ongoing projects.''"
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''And there are only so many hours in the day,'' he added, particularly in Palm Beach, where a job like his requires ceaseless socializing with fretful clients."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"After Frances and then, just three weeks later, Jeanne, ''nobody believed we'd get another hurricane'' Mr. Nievera said."
5,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Many of his clients rushed to restore their gardens to manicured perfection in late 2004 and in 2005, only to have them ripped out again by Wilma."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,Mr. Nievera said most of his clients are growing more cautious about how they spend their garden budgets and asking for plants and trees that are more likely to survive another hurricane.
8,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,They appear to be heeding warnings from meteorologists that the area could face more major hurricanes in coming years.
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Before Wilma ''the sky was the limit,'' he said, referring in particular to the sums spent on recreating his tropical but tailored designs after the 2004 hurricanes."
5,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"A client who approached him for the first time after those storms commissioned a garden with $1 million worth of plants, which was installed just in time for Wilma's arrival."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''My client lost $500,000 worth of plants,'' Mr. Nievera said, adding, ''there's no such thing as hurricane insurance.''"
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Wilma struck as Mr. Nievera was scurrying to get his clients' gardens ready for Thanksgiving, which some regard as the start of the winter season in Palm Beach."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"As a result of the devastation, he is still working to finish several of the projects two months into the season -- a delay that few clients would have tolerated in years past."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"The follies of the 2004-05 winter season have proven useful in one way, enabling Mr. Nievera to tailor his advice to clients based on his own observations of which plants can withstand extreme winds."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"When he advised Tom Quick, a Palm Beach resident whose fortune derives from Quick & Reilly, the former discount brokerage firm, to buy a pair of 30-foot date palms to replace a couple of coconut palms that had succumbed to Frances, it was for aesthetic reasons: they were large enough to hide a view of the house next door that had been opened up by Frances."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"But the date palms, which cost roughly $10,000 apiece and cost $20,000 more to transport and install by crane, proved a practical investment."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''I can't complain: they survived Wilma,'' said Mr. Quick, surveying his backyard."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"A large clusia tree at the back of his house was less fortunate, and is now in dire shape."
8,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''We're planning to replace it,'' Mr. Nievera said."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,''We just can't find the tree.''
0,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Despite an abundance of nurseries in South Florida, plants have been irksomely scarce."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''There are 10 times the number of people looking for plants,'' Mr. Nievera said."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''People wanted to replant their annuals, but there were none to be had."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"And when that happens, everyone gets really mad.''"
0,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,Huge price increases have also caused some ire.
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''Palm trees used to cost $600,'' said Terry Allen Kramer, a perennially tanned banking heiress who is also a Nievera client."
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,''Now one lousy palm tree is three thousand.
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,And these are just plain old coconut palms.
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,Not royal palms.''
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Ms. Kramer was startled when she and her husband, Nick Simunek, flew to Palm Beach the day after Wilma."
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Her palatial estate on South Ocean Boulevard ''looked like the Sahara,'' Ms. Kramer said."
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''I had four feet of sand on my oceanfront lawn, and there was a swath of trees down in the front.''"
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"This after she had spent $50,000 redoing the north and south border gardens, following Frances."
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"The fruit trees have been replaced, but with the rise in prices Ms. Kramer is holding out until spring before deciding whether to replace the 30-foot palms she lost on the ocean side."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Many people are ''waiting to see if they really want to spend that money,'' Mr. Nievera said."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,''It's a real change in mentality.''
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Other clients, though, have asked him to stormproof their grounds, to whatever extent possible."
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Earle Mack, whose appointment as ambassador to Finland had just ended when Wilma struck, and his wife, Carol, had to deploy an army of assistants to clean up their estate, which overlooks the ocean and Lake Worth."
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''We had 17 workers at the house for three weeks,'' Mrs. Mack said."
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,''There was a couple of feet of sand covering everything.
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,There wasn't a single leaf on one shrub or tree.''
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"The couple asked Mr. Nievera to redesign the front of the property, the worst-hit area."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"A defoliated stretch of Australian pine hedge that ran 100 feet along the front wall was replaced by a low-lying row of pittosporum, a hardy broadleaf evergreen shrub."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"By the front door Mr. Nievera created a pair of parterres edged with Purple Queen ground cover and Green Island ficus, interlaced with diamond-shaped sections of sand-colored Chattahoochee stone gravel and contrasting black lava rock."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''It's hard to get any colorful plants to grow on the ocean side of the house,'' Mr. Nievera said, ''so I chose the purple shrubs and gravel to create a sense of color.''"
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"In the center he placed six mimusop trees, which he described as ''very salt tolerant, hard to find and hurricane resistant.''"
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"The ravages of Frances and Wilma also inspired Mr. Nievera to redesign the garden of his own house, a single-story Bermuda-style ranch at the south end of Palm Beach, which he bought in 2001 for a bargain $495,000."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"In November he tore out an allée of storm-ravaged guava trees that used to line his front walkway and replaced them with pygmy dates, which are more resilient."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"He also cut down all his coconut trees, which had mostly been killed."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''I couldn't take it anymore,'' he said."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"And he came up with a novel solution for his ficus hedges, which took a serious beating during both hurricanes."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''Ficus are the least wind-tolerant of plants,'' Mr. Nievera said."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,They tend to lose their leaves and are easily uprooted.
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,''The tendency in Palm Beach is to maintain them very high -- 20 or 30 feet.
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"But you can't do that, because the wind rips right through them.''"
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"After Frances punched large holes in the ficus, Mr. Nievera decided to trim the top of the hedge into an undulating wave pattern to complement the missing sections, giving it a crazy-quilt style that he refers to as his roller coaster."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Meanwhile, for his clients, he has been busy designing ways to conceal an awkward but increasingly familiar addition to Palm Beach's topography: the large propane-fueled electricity generator."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Both Frances and Wilma felled power lines, leaving some houses and businesses without electricity for more than a week each time."
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"(''Palm Beach is very peculiar,'' Ms. Kramer said."
4,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''We pay the highest property taxes, but they don't bury the electric cables.'')"
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"Without air-conditioning, toxic mold flourished in the 90-degree heat and the damp conditions that followed Frances, ruining expensive paint finishes, playing havoc with antique furniture and forcing some collectors to send paintings to the restorer."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,The long wait for electricity prompted several moguls to buy generators large enough to power a tropical mansion.
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"The generators usually take up at least 100 square feet, Mr. Nievera said, and are often seven feet tall."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"They cost an average of $30,000, which does not include the cost of obtaining permits, digging trenches and other aspects of installation."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''It's a carbuncle in the landscape,'' Mr. Nievera said."
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,His landscaping responsibilities now include locating the generators in accordance with local planning rules and selecting fast-growing shrubs to further conceal them.
3,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,He recently obscured a giant generator behind a wall of white-flowering Confederate jasmine.
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,"''Beauty definitely comes at a price,'' Mr. Nievera said."
1,Palm Beach Bows to the Wind,''But people here can afford it.''

0,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"Government complacency, poor planning and dereliction of duty during Hurricane Katrina contributed to the deaths of dozens of the frail and sick in New Orleans, and to the suffering of many others who were stranded in area hospitals and nursing homes unable to care for them, Senate investigators said Tuesday."
0,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"In the second day of Senate hearings on the hurricane response, the focus was on what investigators called perhaps the most outrageous chapter of the storm: the mistreatment of nursing home and hospital patients during the disaster."
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,''How could such a thing happen?''
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and chairwoman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, asked the officials from the State of Louisiana, the City of New Orleans and the state association of nursing homes who attended the hearings."
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,''Why were so many left behind?''
2,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"The witnesses acknowledged a long list of failures that meant there was no coordinated or tested plan in place to evacuate the frail, sick or poor, though studies had warned for more than a decade that an estimated 100,000 New Orleans residents without transportation would need such help in a major hurricane."
2,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"As a result, patients sat in hospitals and nursing homes for days without electricity, fuel, air-conditioning or sufficient food, the witnesses and senators said."
1,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"''It is natural for all of us to believe that fault lies with someone else,'' said Johnny B. Bradberry, secretary of the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development."
1,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,''The real truth is Katrina moved faster than we did.
1,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"All of us on the local, state and the federal levels were overwhelmed, undermined and outmuscled by Mother Nature.''"
2,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"Mr. Bradberry, in an interview with Senate staff members before the hearing, acknowledged that he had done nothing to honor an agreement he signed in April 2005 that his department would be responsible for planning the evacuation of the frail in an emergency."
2,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"''We had no plans in place to do any of this,'' he said."
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"Instead, he testified Tuesday, his focus was on improving the plan for the mass evacuation of the general population, creating a system that opened all the major highway lanes moving away from New Orleans."
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,This ''contraflow'' plan is credited with helping perhaps 1.2 million area residents get out of harm's way.
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"Dr. Kevin U. Stephens, director of the New Orleans Health Department, testified that starting in late 2004 he had tried to create his own plan with bus companies, riverboat owners and Amtrak to evacuate the city's ''special needs'' population."
2,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"But the negotiations were not complete when Hurricane Katrina hit, Dr. Stephens said, in part because of liability questions."
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"Nursing homes, meanwhile, were each supposed to have evacuation plans."
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"At hospitals, because some patients would inevitably be deemed too ill to move, backup generators were to be in place so care could be provided during and after the storm."
2,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"But both plans failed, the investigators were told, in a breakdown that had been predicted in regional hurricane emergency drills."
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"First, only 21 percent of area nursing homes, or nearly 60, evacuated before the storm; one witness said this occurred because in the past, nursing homes were not reimbursed for the cost of the evacuation if the predicted storm did not hit."
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"And many hospitals ignored years of warnings to put generators and electrical switching equipment in places protected from flooding, the witnesses said."
5,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"Once the storm had passed and the city had flooded, even though thousands of patients needed to be evacuated, nursing home operators often could not call for help."
1,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"Even when the requests got through, they were not given a high priority, testified Joseph A. Donchess, executive director of the Louisiana Nursing Home Association."
1,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"Extraordinary suffering and even death resulted, Mr. Donchess said."
5,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"At Bethany Nursing Home in New Orleans, for example, which was surrounded by floodwaters, six or seven patients died while they waited four days for buses to move them, he said."
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,Louisiana statistics released this week show that nearly 70 percent of the 796 deceased Hurricane Katrina victims identified as of late January were 61 years old or older.
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"Senator Collins read an e-mail exchange that took place two days before the hurricane hit, in which an official of the federal Department of Health and Human Services asked a Louisiana official if help was needed ''for patient movement/evacuation or anything else.''"
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"The response, an e-mail message from the federal official said, was that ''they do not require anything at this time and they would be in touch if and when they needed assistance.''"
1,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"Dr. Jimmy Guidry, the state health officer of Louisiana, said the offer for aid was rejected because he did not believe that the federal government was prepared to help."
1,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,Ms. Collins said this answer was unacceptable.
3,Committee Focuses on Failure to Aid New Orleans's Infirm,"''I wonder,'' she said, ''if the dire straits that we heard described this morning would have been as bad as they were if this offer had been accepted.''"

1,"Bush Reaches Out, but Keeps One Hand on the Wheel",Several Democrats said Mr. Bush's words on Wednesday had raised questions about what kind of president would show up when they get down to the business of governing side by side.
1,"Bush Reaches Out, but Keeps One Hand on the Wheel",Some Democrats may have hoped it would be the George W. Bush who contritely acknowledged a ''thumpin' '' for his party the day after the elections in November.
1,"Bush Reaches Out, but Keeps One Hand on the Wheel","But the evidence suggests it is more likely to be the man who all but ignored the disputed circumstances of his election in 2000, governed from then as if he had an expansive mandate and who -- even as he has employed soothing tones in speaking to and about Democrats for the last two months -- has gradually but firmly reasserted himself on both foreign and domestic policy."

1,"Bush Reaches Out, but Keeps One Hand on the Wheel","And in defining his own approach to bipartisanship, Mr. Reid went on to praise Senator Gordon H.

1,"Bush Reaches Out, but Keeps One Hand on the Wheel","Mr. Fratto acknowledged as much, saying, ''We'll have to see as we go forward over the next six months, in particular, if everyone has the same understanding of what bipartisanship means.''"

0,Soldier Reaches Plea Deal in the Killing of 3 Iraqis,"The terms of the plea arrangement will allow the soldier, Specialist Juston R. Graber, originally charged with capital murder, to be convicted of aggravated assault and to receive a nine-month prison sentence in exchange for his testifying against three other members of his squad, the lawyers said."
3,Soldier Reaches Plea Deal in the Killing of 3 Iraqis,"The three other soldiers, members of the same company as Specialist Graber in the division's Third Brigade, still face courts-martial on premeditated-murder charges, making them eligible for the death penalty or, barring that, life in prison."
3,Soldier Reaches Plea Deal in the Killing of 3 Iraqis,"Army prosecutors have accused them of carrying out an impromptu plan, following a raid on a marshy island northwest of Baghdad, to kill the three Iraqis after cutting off their plastic handcuffs and forcing them to run, still blindfolded, from the squalid hut where they had been discovered."
3,Soldier Reaches Plea Deal in the Killing of 3 Iraqis,The two soldiers accused of firing on the men as they fled -- Specialist William B. Hunsaker and Pfc.
3,Soldier Reaches Plea Deal in the Killing of 3 Iraqis,Corey R. Clagett -- have said they shot in self-defense after the three broke free from the thin ''zip-tie'' handcuffs and attacked them.

3,Soldier Reaches Plea Deal in the Killing of 3 Iraqis,"Raymond L. Girouard, the squad's ranking member, is accused of devising the plan to kill the men, then punching Private Clagett and cutting Specialist Hunsaker to give the appearance that they had been attacked."

1,Soldier Reaches Plea Deal in the Killing of 3 Iraqis,"The guilty plea by Specialist Graber, to be entered before an Army judge at Fort Campbell, Ky., and his testimony against the other soldiers will make gaining their acquittal far more difficult than it would have been had all four kept a unified legal front, lawyers for the three others said."

1,Soldier Reaches Plea Deal in the Killing of 3 Iraqis,"But Army prosecutors nonetheless charged Specialist Graber, 21, with premeditated murder, creating an enormous incentive, defense lawyers for the three other soldiers said, for him to plead guilty to a lesser charge that more closely fit the crime."

1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,Arrogance has never been attractive in a leader.
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"Now, in corporate chief executives anyhow, it may be a career ender."
0,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"The surprising defenestration yesterday of Robert L. Nardelli, head of Home Depot and one of the nation's most imperious and highly paid chief executives, was a victory for shareholders hoping to force corporate directors to be more accountable on the increasingly incendiary issue of executive pay."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"Even though the board gave him $20 million that was not a part of his employment contract, perhaps smoothing his way out the door, the departure seemed to be a watershed."
8,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,No longer can executives demand -- and directors happily grant -- contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars without at least some shareholders uttering a peep.
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"Indeed, Mr. Nardelli's resignation seems to indicate a rising fear among Home Depot's directors that they would be subject to even more investor ire and personal embarrassment during the 2007 proxy season than they encountered in 2006, when Mr. Nardelli ran the annual shareholder meeting like a lord over his fief."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"''The departure of Nardelli is good news for shareholders,'' said Frederick E. Rowe Jr., a money manager in Dallas and president of Investors for Director Accountability."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"''To borrow from Winston Churchill, this is the end of the beginning in the war to make directors accountable to the shareholder owners they represent.''"
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,Mr. Nardelli's fall from the executive firmament was fairly stunning.
3,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"In just six years, he went from being one of the most sought-after chief executives, forged in the management crucible that is General Electric, to a top target of investors outraged by his $245 million in total pay over the last five years."
2,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,That amount was seen as completely at odds with the dismal performance of Home Depot stock on his watch.
3,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"Yesterday, the shares closed at $41.07, almost 6 percent lower than they were the day Mr. Nardelli arrived at Home Depot in December 2000."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,''C.E.O.
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"'s now will understand that they've got to put their conscience and shareholder wealth well above their personal gain,'' said Jeffrey M. Cunningham, chairman and chief executive of Directorship, an online information service for board members."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,''Boards create termination packages when no one even contemplates there is going to be a termination and they are extraordinarily rich.
8,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,You are going to see all those plans rethought and rationalized for the new environment.''
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,Shareholders of Home Depot have been smoldering for several years about the company's executive pay practices.
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"Back when Mr. Nardelli arrived, for example, shareholders raised eyebrows after the company granted him a $10 million loan that it subsequently forgave."
3,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,He has earned $20 million to $37 million each year since he joined the company.
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"In 2004, the company quietly changed the measurement it used to calculate long-term incentive pay for executives, upsetting investors when they learned of it later."
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"Previously, the performance measure was based on a peer-group comparison, but the new measure involved only the company's growth in earnings per share."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,It was more easily reached because it was based solely on Home Depot's performance not that of other companies.
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"To some shareholders, changing the performance target in the middle of a year seemed an attempt to ensure a payout despite a dismal performance."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"''We had a problem with that change,'' said Bess Joffe, manager for the Americas at Hermes Investment Management, a money management firm owned by the British Telecom Pension Scheme, the largest pension plan in Britain."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"''After all, shareholders don't get to change the terms under which they bought their shares midstream.''"
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,But it was not until last year that Home Depot's shareholders began to express serious disenchantment with the company's directors over Mr. Nardelli's pay.
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"Last March, about two months before Home Depot's annual shareholder meeting, the board was named one of the 11 worst executive pay offenders by the Corporate Library, a corporate governance research firm."
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"In the weeks leading up to the meeting, shareholder advisory firms recommended withholding votes from Home Depot directors to voice their dismay over the disconnect between performance and pay at the company."
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"But Mr. Nardelli's biggest error, and the act that may have set his demise in motion, was his shocking decision to run the annual meeting last May alone, insisting that his directors stay away and limiting questions from the shareholders."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"''I've never heard of anything like that happening before, where directors don't show up,'' Ms. Joffe said."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,''It's the one time of year that shareholders have a right to be present and stand up and speak their mind and directors have to respond.''
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,Stockholders were outraged.
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,At least 30 percent of shareholders voting at the meeting withheld support from 10 of the company's directors.
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,Some 32 percent withheld support from Mr. Nardelli.
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"Almost 36 percent of those voting withheld support from Claudio X. Gonzalez, chairman and chief executive of Kimberly-Clark's Mexico operations and the director who had headed the compensation committee when the company changed its performance goals midstream."
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,Many shareholders also favored a proposal urging the Home Depot board to allow its investors to vote on an advisory basis to approve the company's compensation; 40 percent voted for the measure.
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,Shareholders also supported a measure that would have required the board to accept resignations from directors who failed to receive support from a majority of votes cast.
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"After the meeting, Home Depot said it would require such a vote from shareholders for the election of its directors."
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"Even so, the company continued to tinker last year with its pay practices in a way that may have been intended to generate pay for Mr. Nardelli in periods of poor performance at the company."
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"Last November, a Home Depot spokesman disclosed that the company's huge stock buybacks, which have the effect of increasing earnings when measured per share, would be included in the calculation of long-term incentive targets."
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"In previous years, the effects of the buybacks were excluded from the calculations."
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"John A. Hill, the chairman of Putnam Funds, was one investor whose organization voted against Home Depot management at last year's meeting."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,He said he was optimistic that Mr. Nardelli's resignation signaled a new responsiveness among corporate directors.
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,But he is uncertain.
8,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"''I think if a lot more shareholders withhold their votes for this board in the upcoming proxy season over their agreement with Nardelli, then it will really start to have an impact,'' Mr. Hill said."
8,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"''But as long as it is a minority, it won't.''"
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,Mr. Hill personally experienced Mr. Nardelli's disdain toward his shareholders.
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"As chairman of Putnam Funds, he wrote a letter after the annual meeting to Mr. Nardelli explaining why he had not earned the funds' support at the election."
5,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"He did not get a reply until August, when a reporter asked Home Depot why the chief executive had not responded to one of its large shareholders."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,"''He had become a lightning rod with the stock down,'' Mr. Hill said."
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,''But his not replying to our letter showed an arrogance there that came in on him.''
1,A Warning Shot by Investors to Boards and Chiefs,It seems that ''my way or the highway'' -- Mr. Nardelli's message to Home Depot's beleaguered shareholders in recent years -- does not play that well anymore.

Card Jr., the chief of staff -- on the day the hurricane hit to report that it had turned into his ''worst nightmare'' and that New Orleans was flooding."

2,Ex-FEMA Leader Faults Response by White House,"In the aftermath of the storm, administration officials said they were caught by surprise when they were told of the levee breach on Tuesday, Aug. 30."
2,Ex-FEMA Leader Faults Response by White House,"Mr. Hagin was the senior staff member with President Bush on the day the hurricane hit, when Mr. Bush was traveling in California."
3,Ex-FEMA Leader Faults Response by White House,Mr. Brown's politically charged appearance before the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs quickly divided the panel's members by party.
3,Ex-FEMA Leader Faults Response by White House,Several Republican senators peppered him with hostile questions and suggested he was trying to deflect the blame from his own failures.
3,Ex-FEMA Leader Faults Response by White House,"In contrast, Mr. Brown drew a gentle, even warm response from Democrats who said he had unfairly been made a scapegoat by the administration, though last year it was frequently Mr. Brown himself who drew the most fire from Democrats in Washington."
3,Ex-FEMA Leader Faults Response by White House,"In contrast to low-key statements in the past, Mr. Brown, who resigned under pressure on Sept. 12 as director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, was aggressively on the defensive, saying he was ''sick and tired'' of his remarks or e-mail messages being taken out of context or hearing that he lacked the leadership skills for his job."

0,Ex-FEMA Leader Faults Response by White House,"Even if he had, Mr. Brown said, it would have been a waste of time because FEMA's role within the Homeland Security Department had been subordinated to fighting terror."

2,France 'jailbreak king' snared after Hollywood-like helicopter escape,"Redoine Faid, who has said his life of crime was inspired by blockbusters such as “Scarface” and “Reservoir Dogs,” escaped in July from a high-security prison where he was serving 25 years for a heist in which a police officer was killed."
2,France 'jailbreak king' snared after Hollywood-like helicopter escape,"His demise after three months on the run followed phone taps and monitoring of a woman who, prosecutor Francois Molins told a news conference, transported people believed to include Faid to a flat in burqas, a head-to-toe, face-concealing garb commonly worn by women in Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan."
0,France 'jailbreak king' snared after Hollywood-like helicopter escape,"He was arrested as he slept at an apartment in Creil, an hour’s drive north of Paris and not much further from the jail he escaped from south of the French capital in early July."

5,France 'jailbreak king' snared after Hollywood-like helicopter escape,"Faid, 46, became a notorious semi-celebrity after penning a tell-all book about his colourful life, describing how he was born into crime in high-rise housing estates of the kind that sprang up around Paris in the 1960s and 1970s."

0,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"Seeking more money from Washington for hurricane relief, Gov."
0,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,Kathleen Babineaux Blanco entered uncharted legal territory with a threat on Monday to block oil and gas leases worth hundreds of millions to the federal treasury unless the state received its ''fair share'' of the revenues.
1,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"''It's time to play hardball, as I believe that's the only game Washington understands,'' Ms. Blanco said Monday night as she opened the second special legislative session she has called since Hurricanes Katrina and Rita."
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,Oil and gas companies pay for the right to extract natural resources from the Gulf of Mexico.
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"Louisiana collects royalties, as well as severance taxes on resources extracted within three miles of its border."
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,Those programs add hundreds of millions of dollars a year to the state treasury.
2,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"Louisiana receives no share of the leasing fees on oil and gas reserves beyond the three miles, which are in federal waters."
2,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"The federal government negotiates those leases, which give more influential states like Florida and Texas extended state waters, effective every August."
0,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"Ms. Blanco, a Democrat, said Monday that she sought to split the leasing fees 50-50."
0,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"''If no effort is made to guarantee our fair share of royalties,'' she said, ''I have warned the federal government that we will be forced to block the August sale of offshore oil and gas leases.''"
8,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,It remains to be seen whether the governor has the authority to block the leases.
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"By statute, the Minerals Management Service, the agency in the Interior Department that oversees offshore leases, has to seek comment from the affected governors."
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,It is not clear what occurs if a governor refuses to approve a pact.
1,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"''You can say we're in unprecedented territory here,'' said David E. Dismukes, associate director of the Center for Energy Studies at Louisiana State University."
8,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,Mr. Dismukes said there could be a protracted legal contest if no settlement was reached and the governor felt compelled to carry through on her ultimatum.
8,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"A spokesman for the Minerals Management Service, Gary Strasburg, said Congress could earmark a share of the leasing revenue to any state."
1,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"As Mr. Strasburg described the process, seeking a governor's advice seemed little more than intergovernmental courtesy."
8,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"''It's not an issue of whether or not the governor approves of what we're doing, because if she voices an objection, we'll note that and continue with our negotiations one way or another,'' he said."
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"The federal government collected more than $1.5 billion in leasing fees last year from oil and gas companies along the Gulf Coast, a significant part from rigs off Louisiana."
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,The state faces a shortfall of nearly $1 billion in the current fiscal year.
1,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"The fight for a larger share of leasing revenue predates Hurricane Katrina, said Andy Kopplin, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, and is closely linked to the damage that pipelines and oil-service vessels inflict on coastal wetlands."
1,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"The greater the coastal erosion, the greater the storm surge after a hurricane."
1,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"''There's a very clear connection between our role providing one-quarter of the oil and gas produced in this country and our vulnerability to hurricanes,'' Mr. Kopplin said."
1,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,''The governor's point is that we need a greater share of the revenues from offshore oil and gas to help us restore and protect our coastline.''
8,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"Even if Ms. Blanco never carries through on her threat, her speaking up may help by keeping the recovery question on the radar in Washington, said T. Wayne Parent, a political scientist at L.S.U."
1,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"''The fear here is that the Congress and the president seem to be moving on to other things,'' Professor Parent said."
1,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,''She knows that this will capture people's attention and force people to pay attention to Louisiana.''
1,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"That fear has been particularly acute since last week, he said, when President Bush ''barely mentioned Hurricane Katrina'' in his State of the Union speech."
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"On Monday, Ms. Blanco also announced how the state plans to allocate the $7.7 billion from Washington for block grants and repairing hazards."
8,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"The bulk of that, $4.6 billion, should be spent helping homeowners replace or repair houses damaged in the storm, she said."
1,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,She added that the money was not nearly enough to help compensate people who lost houses to the storms.
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"''We had 10 times more businesses destroyed,'' Ms. Blanco said Monday."
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,''We had five times more jobs lost.
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,And we weathered more than 75 percent of the total property and infrastructure damage caused by the storm.
3,Governor Threatens to Block Energy Leases Off Louisiana,"However, we received only 54 percent of the block grant funding.''"

0,Ban on All Political Gifts Is Included in Ethics Reform Proposals by New Jersey Senate Leader,The president of the New Jersey State Senate on Thursday proposed a ban on all gifts to lawmakers as part of a sweeping package of bills intended to stiffen penalties for ethics violations.

Codey, said he also planned to introduce measures that would ban political contributions by public entities, step up ethics training for lawmakers and their aides and provide full disclosure for expenditures that are added to the state's budget at the last minute."
7,Ban on All Political Gifts Is Included in Ethics Reform Proposals by New Jersey Senate Leader,"Mr. Codey said the measures, which he hoped would pass by the end of the legislative session on July 1, would bolster public confidence in elected officials in a state that has seen more than 200 federal corruption convictions in the past five years."

0,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"(Reuters Health) - With recent revelations that U.S. law enforcement can - and already has - dipped into consumer genealogy DNA databases to help solve crimes, experts say more discussion of the ethical issues raised by this unintended use of personal information is needed."
0,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"It’s unclear, for instance, whether online genealogy site users know their DNA is available to criminal investigators - and whether they’d object to it being used for that purpose, write the authors of an essay exploring the topic in the Annals of Internal Medicine."
1,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,“We’re seeing a divide about this right now.
1,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"On one hand, it’s a powerful technology to solve cases, but it also raises questions for consumers,” said lead author Benjamin Berkman, who heads the section on the ethics of genetics and new technologies at the National Institutes of Health’s Department of Bioethics in Bethesda, Maryland."
1,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"“The idea that they upload their data for genealogy purposes and it’s used in such a different way really surprises some people,” he told Reuters Health in a telephone interview."
1,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"“The terms of service agreements don’t explain this clearly, and even if they did, people wouldn’t read it or find it in the dense legalese.”"
2,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"Berkman and his co-authors were moved to write about the issue after the April arrest of a 72-year-old man suspected of being the Golden State Killer, a serial rapist and murderer who committed at least 12 murders, more than 50 rapes and more than 100 burglaries in California from 1974 to 1986."
3,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,Police detectives had compared DNA from several crime scenes against online DNA-genealogy data to track down this suspect.
0,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"Although investigators have long used DNA for forensic purposes, they have typically compared samples to databases created specifically for criminal justice purposes, the authors note."
1,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"And in the realm of scientific and medical research, people who provide samples have clear expectations for “informed consent.” They want researchers to ask permission, but are generally comfortable with giving it for wide-ranging research uses of the material."

0,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"It can result in arrests of guilty relatives for crimes they committed but also potentially false-positives mistakenly identifying innocent people, the study authors note."
8,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"When investigators conduct forensics research with genealogy DNA, they may also interview suspects and contact relatives to obtain more information."
1,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"Since law enforcement agencies haven’t been clear about how these investigations are conducted, it’s tough to debate whether these communications are harmful or an ethical quandary, said Stephanie Malia Fullerton of the University of Washington School of Medicine’s Department of Bioethics and Humanities, who wasn’t involved in the essay."
1,Experts outline ethics issues with use of genealogy DNA to solve crimes,"“We don’t actually know how many people who have placed their data in these online databases are subject to forensic uses,” she said in a telephone interview."

0,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,President Bush is seeking a new chief lawyer with credentials as a proven combatant as he and his staff prepare for a potential raft of investigations from Democrats in Congress who have promised to challenge the White House's conduct of policy and its assertions of executive power.
0,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"Republicans who have consulted with administration officials on personnel said the White House chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, was looking for a seasoned Washington hand to succeed Harriet E. Miers, the White House counsel who announced her resignation on Thursday."
1,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"Republicans said Friday in interviews that the White House was now, in essence, seeking a politically savvy outsider with ties throughout the capital and in Congress who might be called upon to become something of a public figure in potentially high-profile fights."
1,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"''They need somebody who can sit down face-to-face with an ornery committee chairman and work out a conflict over an oversight request,'' said Bradford A. Berenson, a former associate counsel for Mr. Bush during his first term."
1,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,''The job will require a certain minimum level of stature and a minimum level of political experience.''
1,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"Several Republicans, including some former administration officials, said the new White House counsel would also need the stature to counterbalance David S. Addington, the powerful chief of staff of Vice President Dick Cheney."
1,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"Mr. Addington has tended to argue against cooperating with Congressional requests for classified information, a position that may require some softening, or at least more diplomacy, in the 110th Congress."
1,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"The White House is, in some respects, seeking a figure who is the mirror opposite of Ms. Miers, who has not shown a high level of comfort being a public figure, especially since withdrawing herself from the Supreme Court nominating process in 2005 under heavy fire from liberals and conservatives."
1,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"Ms. Miers spent most of her career in Texas, and did most of her maneuvering within the White House."
1,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"Mr. Bush's choice will be in the mold of the former solicitor general, Theodore B. Olson, said Republican allies of Mr. Bush who are familiar with the administration's views."
3,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"These people, speaking anonymously to preserve their access to White House officials, said they took Mr. Olson at his word that he was not interested in the position."
3,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"These Republicans said other contenders in that mold include Fred F. Fielding, the Reagan-era White House counsel who is now a corporate lawyer in Washington; Charles J. Cooper, a former Justice Department official under President Ronald Reagan, also now practicing law in Washington; Laurence H. Silberman, the retired United States Court of Appeals judge close to Mr. Cheney; and David Aufhauser, the former general counsel for the Treasury Department who is now the global general counsel for UBS, the Swiss bank."
5,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"Mr. Aufhauser, who has worked with Ms. Miers, also played a crucial legal role for Mr. Bush during the recount of the presidential vote in 2000."
3,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"Another name bandied about by some Republicans, but considered a long shot because he lacks Washington legal experience, is J. Thomas Schieffer, the ambassador to Japan who is both a friend and former business partner of President Bush."
3,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"Mr. Schieffer has been overseas since 2001, having been ambassador to Australia, and may be interested in a Washington job."
1,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"The people familiar with the White House thinking said Ms. Miers's departure, coming amid a number of changes in top administration jobs, had been among the most painful personally for Mr. Bush, who has grown quite close to her over more than a decade of collaboration."
2,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,Her resignation capped months of speculation about her future at the White House.
3,White House Seeks Lawyer Wise to Ways of Congress,"Republicans close to the White House said that, in the spring, Mr. Bolten had considered replacing Ms. Miers but that Mr. Bush had made it clear he would consider no such thing."

0,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"MERGERS and acquisitions have been booming, and investors looking for a way to profit from them have a simple solution at hand: they can invest in mutual funds that specialize in buying shares of companies that are being acquired."
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,But don't expect to make a killing.
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,These funds -- and there are at least five of them -- are generally considered to be having a good year if they double the returns on three-month Treasury bills.
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"Last year, the five funds returned 10.1 percent, on average, while T-bills averaged less than 5 percent, but still gained far less than the nearly 16 percent return for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index."
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"Over five years, the funds' return was 5.5 percent, annualized, compared with 6.2 percent for the S.& P."
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"Mainly, the funds offer extremely consistent gains from a highly diverse portfolio, and at the end of a year investors almost always have more than they did in January."
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"Consider the Merger Fund, the oldest and biggest at $1.5 billion."
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,It has had only one losing year out of 17.
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"The Gabelli ABC fund, the second-oldest and third-largest with $193 million in assets, is a perfect 13-0."
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"''What we do is fairly straightforward,'' said Frederick W. Green, president of the Merger Fund."
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,''We're the sleep-well-at-night fund.''
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"The gains come from buying shares in a company that is being acquired, but for less than the acquirer plans to pay, then cashing out when the deal is done."
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"Because, as Mr. Green says, 95 percent of the mergers are completed, generally within a matter of months, it's a pretty safe bet that buyers will earn the difference, or spread, between the two prices."
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"The favorable odds go a long way toward explaining why merger or risk arbitrage, as the strategy is known, produces returns that tend to be lower, on average, than those of other stock investments."
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"Investors trying to buy the shares after a merger announcement can't expect to get the stock for much less than the acquirer's offer, because the current shareholders can reasonably count on getting that price shortly."
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"How much less depends on a number of factors for both buyer and seller -- for example, what their money could reliably earn in another investment, like three-month Treasury bills, or the value attached to the 1-in-20 possibility that the deal will fall through (say, over regulatory problems)."
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"When mergers are plentiful, as they are now, fund managers can pick their targets more carefully than usual."
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"And with interest rates having edged higher, the spreads have widened between the post-announcement market price and the offer price."
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"At times, some merger funds will short the stock of the acquirer as well as buy shares in the target company."
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"The tactic is similar to that used by hedge funds engaged in arbitrage, though without black-box secrecy or the risk of leveraging."
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"The price of the acquirer's shares tends to slip after the offer is made, so shorting those shares is a way to improve returns."
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"The five-year-old AXA Enterprise Mergers and Acquisitions fund, the second-largest fund with $304 million in assets, adds a much riskier arbitrage strategy to the mix."
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"One-third of its capital is invested in companies that Mario J. Gabelli, the veteran money manager who oversees the fund along with his namesake ABC fund, regards as having the potential to be acquired."
3,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"For example, three companies in which he invests as takeover candidates are U.S. Cellular, Sensient Technologies and Cadbury Schweppes."
1,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,Potential takeover targets in general are more speculative investments than the traditional arbitrage plays.
8,One Way to Play the Mergers Boom,"If the main appeal of a company is its takeover potential and no offers materialize, its stock price may fall and give the fund a loss."

1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","In a way, Mr. Padilla's prosecution was a legal maneuver that kept the issue of his detention without charges out of the Supreme Court."
5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","After apprehending him at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago in May 2002, the Bush administration made a choice: to detain Mr. Padilla militarily, in order to thwart further plotting, rather than to follow him in order to gather evidence that might serve a criminal prosecution."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","Now that Mr. Padilla has ended up a criminal defendant after all, the prosecution's case does not fully reflect the Bush administration's view of who he is or what he did."
3,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","Senior government officials have said publicly that Mr. Padilla provided self-incriminating information during interrogations, admitting, they said, to undergoing basic terrorist training, to accepting an assignment to blow up apartment buildings in the United States, and to attending a farewell dinner with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the suspected master planner of the Sept. 11 attacks, before he flew to Chicago in 2002."
3,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","But any confessions by Mr. Padilla while he was detained without charges and denied access to counsel -- whether or not he was mistreated, as his lawyers claim -- would not be admissible in court."
8,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","And it is unlikely that information obtained during the harsh questioning of Al Qaeda detainees would be admissible, either -- and, further, the government is disinclined to expose sensitive intelligence or invite further scrutiny of secret jails overseas."

0,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","Mr. Padilla, who was appended to their pre-existing case, in which he had been an unnamed co-conspirator, is depicted as their recruit."
3,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","Although prosecutors have declined to discuss the government's strategy, their filings and statements in court provide a picture of the case they are expected to present at trial."
5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","The most tangible allegation against Mr. Padilla is that in 2000 he filled out, under an alias, an Arab-language application to attend a terrorist training camp."
8,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","That application is expected to be offered into evidence alongside the wiretapped conversations, but Mr. Padilla's lawyers say they will contest its admissibility, challenging the government's assertion that the ''mujahideen data form'' belonged to their client."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","Robert Chesney, a specialist in national security law at Wake Forest University, called the prosecution a pragmatic one, analogous to ''going after Al Capone on tax evasion.''"
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","But Deborah Pearlstein, a lawyer with Human Rights First who has consulted with Mr. Padilla's defense, said that his will never be an ordinary, pragmatic prosecution."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","''If Jose Padilla were from Day 1 just charged and tried, then maybe,'' she said."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case",''But this is a case that comes after three and a half years of the most gross deprivation of human rights that we've seen in this country for a long time.''
8,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","Further, Ms. Pearlstein noted, the government has reserved the option, should the prosecution fail, of returning Mr. Padilla to the military brig."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","This, she said, ''casts a shadow'' over the current prosecution."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","The Bush administration's military case against Binyam Mohamed, 28, the Ethiopian detainee at Guantánamo, put the current proceedings in a different light, too."
5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","In December 2005, Mr. Mohamed was referred to the military commission in Guantánamo on accusations that he conspired with Mr. Padilla on the dirty bomb plot."
5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case",It was little noticed at the time.
3,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","But accusations against Mr. Padilla that are nowhere to be found in the indictment against him filled the pages of Mr. Mohamed's charging sheet, with Mr. Padilla repeatedly identified by name."
3,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","The sheet referred to the two men meeting in Pakistan after Sept. 11, 2001, studying how to build an improvised dirty bomb, discussing the feasibility of a dirty bomb attack with Al Qaeda officials and agreeing to undertake the mission to blow up buildings."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","Mr. Mohamed's lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith, said that these charges were based on a forced confession by Mr. Mohamed, who, he said, was tortured overseas into admitting to a story that was fed to him."

3,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case",The charges against Mr. Mohamed and other Guantánamo detainees who were headed for prosecution there have been suspended temporarily as a result of the Military Commissions Act passed by Congress in October.

1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case",That Mr. Mohamed faced dirty bomb charges and Mr. Padilla does not speaks to the central difference between being a terrorism suspect in Guantánamo and a criminal defendant charged with terrorism offenses in the United States.
8,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","In Guantánamo, the military commission system that deals with foreign-born terrorism suspects is expected to allow, with some exceptions, the use of information obtained through coercion."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","''Federal court rules are restrictive,'' Professor Chesney of Wake Forest University School of Law said."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case",''The very essence of why they're trying to have that separate military system was to create rules to use information that is deemed by the intelligence community to be trustworthy but wouldn't make it under the federal rules of evidence.''
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","David Cole, a professor of law at Georgetown University and author of books on terrorism and civil liberties, sees the difference between the two systems more critically: ''What this says clearly is that they feel that they can get away with using tainted evidence in the military commission system that they can't use in the criminal court system.''"
3,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case",The Wiretapping Case
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","The criminal case against Mr. Padilla has its roots in the prosecution of Sheikh Omer Abdel Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric who was convicted in 1995 of conspiring to blow up the United Nations and other New York landmarks."
5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","In the early 1990s, Sheikh Rahman's telephone was tapped, and Mr. Hassoun and Dr. Jayyousi, a Jordanian-born American citizen who holds a doctorate in civil engineering, came to the government's attention through phone calls to or from his line."
5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","Then the government, under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, began to eavesdrop on them, which eventually pulled Mr. Padilla into their net, too."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","The government presents the three defendants as ''joined at the hip,'' as one prosecutor put it in a hearing last summer."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","But Judge Marcia G. Cooke of Federal District Court, noting that Mr. Padilla was appended to a case well under way, asked the government, ''If they are so joined at the hip, why is Mr. Padilla so late to the dance?''"

5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case",The seven taped phone calls that bear Mr. Padilla's voice involve conversations with Mr. Hassoun from 1997 to 2000.
5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","On those calls, Mr. Padilla, unlike some of the other defendants, does not employ what the government says is coded language."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","According to the government, other defendants refer to their jihad-related plans as ''getting some fresh air,'' ''participating in tourism,'' ''opening up a market,'' ''playing football,'' and so on."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","This leads to silly-sounding exchanges where ''the brothers'' discuss going on ''picnics'' in order ''to smell fresh air and to eat cheese'' or using $3,500 to buy ''zucchini.''"
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","In contrast, Mr. Padilla's seven conversations with Mr. Hassoun range from straightforward -- Mr. Hassoun tells Mr. Padilla that his grandmother has died; Mr. Padilla tells Mr. Hassoun that he has found himself an 18-year-old Egyptian bride who is willing to wear a veil -- to vaguely suggestive or just odd."
5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","In one phone call, the two men talked about a dream."
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","It appeared to be the dream that Mr. Padilla, according to his relatives, cites as having played a crucial role in inspiring him to convert to Islam: the vision of a man in a turban, surrounded by the swirling dust of a desert."
5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case",Mr. Hassoun brought it up and told Mr. Padilla that he himself had experienced the same vision.
5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case",''What do you mean you saw the same dream?''

5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case",''Yeah?''
5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case",Mr. Padilla said.
1,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","In three of the seven conversations, Mr. Padilla made statements that the government has identified as ''overt acts'' in furtherance of the accused conspiracy."

5,"In Padilla Wiretaps, Murky View of ‘Jihad’ Case","and Mr. Padilla said, ''God willing, brother, it's going to happen soon.''"

0,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"But Nancy Pelosi, the new speaker of the House, and Harry Reid, the new Senate majority leader, dismissed that approach as a strategy ''that has already failed.''"
0,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"''Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain,'' Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Reid wrote in a letter to Mr. Bush."
0,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"''We are well past the point of more troops for Iraq,'' they added, urging Mr. Bush to begin a ''phased redeployment,'' or gradual withdrawal."
1,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"Not all Democrats agree with the position their leaders staked out in the letter on Friday, just days before Mr. Bush is expected to announce a broad strategy involving more troops, accelerated training of Iraqi forces and a large increase in economic and reconstruction aid to Iraq."
8,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,But the release of the letter suggests that a major political battle may be brewing.
3,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,Mr. Bush appeared to be trying to head off any confrontation when he invited 13 Democratic and Republican senators to the White House Friday for what administration officials called a ''consultation'' on Iraq.
3,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"At a later meeting, Mr. Bush met with the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, who cautioned that Congress would want to take time to consider the strategy before Mr. Bush began implementing it."

3,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"He announced the nomination of Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus as the new commander in Iraq, to succeed Gen. George W. Casey Jr., whom Mr. Bush said he intended to elevate to Army chief of staff."
1,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"Mr. Bush praised General Casey, who spent much of 2006 pressing for a gradual withdrawal of troops, as ''strong and effective''; he hailed General Petraeus, who has reportedly backed an increase, as ''a soldier of vision and determination.''"

8,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,The bigger question is whether Congress will seek to stop the troop increase.
8,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"In theory, it could cut off financing, the only way it could actually interfere with the commander in chief's plans."
1,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"But Democrats have said they would not take such a step, largely out of fear of being accused of undercutting the troops."
3,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"That leaves them with only one option: holding a series of hearings, which start next week, immediately after the president's speech, that are intended to expose the divisions within the military over the wisdom of increasing troops."
1,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"Many senior officers, including General Casey, have argued that adding American troops will undercut the effort to get the Iraqi government to defend itself."

8,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"Senator Mary L.

1,Bush Facing Deep Divide Over More Troops for Iraq,"In interviews after the meeting, several senators said they could not tell whether Mr. Bush had made a decision whether to call for a troop increase."

3,Latest Plan Sets a Series of Goals for Iraq Leaders,Most of the funds allocated for the Sunni-dominated Anbar Province in western Iraq have never actually been expended.

8,Latest Plan Sets a Series of Goals for Iraq Leaders,Administration officials said that by more clearly defining the goals and by planning to make them public some time after Mr. Bush's address they hoped to encourage a sense of accountability on the part of the Iraqis.
3,Latest Plan Sets a Series of Goals for Iraq Leaders,"Mr. Bush discussed some of the goals -- the need for provincial elections, the enactment of the oil law and reform of Iraq's de-Baathification policy -- during his recent video conference with Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki."

0,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"(Reuters) - Global warming has increased the likelihood of more massive, sluggish storms like Florence, capable of dropping record amounts of rain and causing the type of catastrophic flooding that crippled North and South Carolina this week, experts said."
2,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,Most meteorologists agree that climate change can increase the volume of water vapor stored within weather systems.
2,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"More water vapor means more rain, especially when the storm is a crawler like Florence, which slowed to about 2 miles per hour (3.2 km per hour) after slamming into the North Carolina coast."
1,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"When storms such as Harvey, which struck Texas last year, and Florence come to a virtual stall, a deluge of rain can fall in the matter of days, equal to what an area typically sees in a year, they said."
1,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"“It is compelling and sobering to see these storms come in back-to-back seasons,” said Jim Kossin, an atmospheric research scientist with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."
1,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,His research suggests that global warming has affected the speed of storms as well as the amount of moisture they contain.
3,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"Florence, which has killed at least 36 people, dumped up to 36 inches (91 cm) of rain in parts of North Carolina since Thursday."
3,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"At least 16 rivers remained at a major flood stage, with three others set to crest in the coming days in North Carolina, the state said."
5,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"It has been a little more than a year since Hurricane Harvey dumped trillions of gallons of water on Texas and the U.S. Gulf Coast, killing 68 people and causing an estimated $125 billion in property damage."
3,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"Based on data from about seven decades of storms, Kossin found tropical-cyclone speed had decreased globally by 10 percent from 1949 to 2016, according to a paper published in June in the scientific journal Nature."
2,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"The reason is that climate change is warming the Arctic much more than it is heating up the Tropics, easing the pressure difference between the two, he said in an interview on Wednesday."
2,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"Pressure differences drive the winds, which in turn can steer and slow down storms, he said."
1,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"In the case of Florence, warmer sea temperatures and the amount of available moisture in the air may have increased rainfall by as much as 50 percent in the hardest-hit areas, according to a study by researchers at Stony Brook University, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the National Center for Atmospheric Research."
1,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"To make matters worse, Florence was about 50 miles (80 km) larger in diameter due to global warming, putting more people in harm’s way, the study showed."
1,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"“We can attribute that additional rainfall to human-induced climate change,” said Kevin Reed, a professor at Stony Brook University’s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences, who contributed to the study."
8,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"The paper, still unpublished, may fuel an ongoing debate in the scientific community about whether climate change, induced by human activity, has a direct impact on the strength and size of a storm."
1,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"Global warming has greatly increased the chances of another storm of Harvey’s magnitude hitting Texas again, according to a published study by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Kerry Emanuel."
1,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"The likelihood of more massive rainfalls also should raise red flags for both coastal and inland communities and get them to rethink plans for storm-related inundation, experts said."
1,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,This includes planning for massive evacuations and making improvements to infrastructure related to water-flow resources to help ease the blow.
3,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"Most of the damage caused by Harvey and Florence has come from the flooding, which has devastated cities and rural areas, turning highways into rivers and pastures into lakes."
8,Florence portends more massive hurricanes in age of global warming,"“There is going to be both more inland flooding and more storm-surge, ocean-related flooding because the ocean is getting higher,” said Brion Callori, senior vice president of engineering and research at commercial property insurance firm FM Global."

3,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"At the halfway mark between the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina last year and the beginning of the 2006 hurricane season on June 1, the Army Corps of Engineers has completed only 16 percent of its planned repairs to New Orleans's battered flood protection system, according to corps representatives."
0,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"The corps says its work is on track for restoring the system to its pre-hurricane strength by the June 1 deadline, but in the meantime many groups that have studied the disaster are coming up with proposals of their own that they say could be cheaper, faster or stronger."
0,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"The Bring New Orleans Back Commission, the group formed by Mayor C. Ray Nagin to produce a blueprint for the city's recovery, issued a proposal on Wednesday to upgrade hurricane protection with measures beyond what the corps has called for."
0,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"To prevent storm surges from pushing into the city's drainage canals, the commission proposed a series of jetties to stand in front of the three canals, which it says could be built quickly and cheaply and provide New Orleans with some much-needed peace of mind."
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"''There is, very much, a tension between things that can be done quickly versus those that might take a little longer,'' Lawrence Roth, deputy executive director of the American Society of Civil Engineers, said in a telephone interview on Friday."
3,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"His group has weighed in with far-reaching recommendations, and other groups are preparing proposals of their own."
0,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"The mayor's commission also proposed a network of dams that would block or slow the opening between the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal and Lake Pontchartrain, and block storm surges from flowing up the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation channel that has been blamed for a storm surge funnel effect that increased the damage to eastern New Orleans."
0,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,The group is also calling for long-term flood-control structures that would block or slow surges at the two passes between Lake Pontchartrain and the Gulf of Mexico.
0,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"The fast-track structures would cost $100 million to $170 million, according to the commission's estimates, a fraction of the $3.1 billion the federal government has proposed spending on flood control measures in the area."
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"The commission said its proposals would not interfere with any of the corps's plans, but would be add-ons that complement the current plans."
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"The proposals have not yet found broad support among other engineering experts who have been working on strengthening New Orleans's storm defenses, but Dan Hitchings, the director of the corps's Task Force Hope, which is coordinating the hurricane response in Louisiana and Mississippi, said the plans were welcome and would be examined."
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"Mr. Roth, of the Society of Civil Engineers, said there would always be competing ideas about how to improve flood protection."
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"The idea of jetties, he said, might be made moot by closing off the canals and putting in new pumping stations at the lake, as the corps has planned."
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"''Many different people can look at a problem and come up with many different solutions, all with tradeoffs,'' he said."
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,''Which would be better -- jetties or a pump station?
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,You might never get an answer to that.''
3,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"Meanwhile, the corps's work to restore flood protection to its pre-hurricane levels continues around the clock."
3,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"This month the corps solicited bids for building temporary closures and pumps at the mouths of the city's three drainage canals, and it is rebuilding long stretches of levee in St. Bernard Parish and along the Inner Harbor Navigational Canal."
3,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"The corps is looking to measures that will further strengthen the flood protection system, including restoring levees to their originally designed heights."
8,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"These measures can be in place by September 2007, according to the corps."
3,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"Beyond that, the corps has embarked on a two-year, $8 million study to determine how to strengthen the hurricane protection system for New Orleans and southern Louisiana."
8,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,A preliminary version of that report is due in June.
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"While the Bush administration's top official on Gulf Coast reconstruction, Donald Powell, has said the government will build a system that is ''better and stronger'' than what was there before, the administration has not committed to what the people of New Orleans desperately want: protection from Category 5 storms, the toughest that nature can dish out."
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,Mr. Hitchings said that the corps was slightly behind schedule but that he expected things to move quickly.
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"''It's not linear,'' he said, because the ''gear-up time'' to get contractors in place and to make materials like the enormous quantities of soil available was so great."
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"Now ''they're really moving out,'' he said."
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"The corps built 30 days of weather delays into the schedule, he said, and with a little help from favorable weather, ''I'm very optimistic that they will regain their schedule and in the end get it all finished with plenty of time.''"
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"The corps's long-term study, he said, would probably have a lot in common with the outside proposals that are beginning to flow in, but ''right now, we're focused on the very near term.''"
3,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,The engineering society is investigating the failure of the levees and is working with the groups that will monitor the corps's progress.
3,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,Its recommendations include ''armoring'' the dry side of levees so they are not eroded away from underneath if water spills over the top.
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"Without armoring, Mr. Roth said, ''failure is catastrophic because it causes the wall to fail.''"
3,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"The corps has said that the armoring process, like other projects that would go beyond the restoration of the levees to pre-hurricane strength, will have to be approved by Congress."
1,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"''It's going to take people being willing to take a chance, to be bold, to sort out Louisiana's levee problems,'' said Ivor van Heerden, deputy director of the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center and a member of Team Louisiana, the group formed by the state to investigate the causes of the levee failures."
3,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"His group, too, will be making proposals for upgrading protection for the region."

8,Competing Plans to Repair New Orleans Flood Protection,"''Nature may give us another 10 years before we get another Katrina, or maybe not."

0,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"In a rare reprise to a rare trial, the jury that convicted a Long Island man of murder by depraved indifference last October in a drunken-driving crash that killed a limousine driver and a 7-year-old girl may be brought back to court for hearings on whether some members acted improperly during deliberations."
2,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"In an answer submitted on Dec. 29 to a defense motion, Robert Hayden, an assistant Nassau County district attorney, agreed that a hearing should be held to determine if jurors discussed what they believed were prior drunken-driving charges against the defendant, Martin Heidgen, 25."
2,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"Such accusations were not included in the evidence introduced in the five-week trial, and could be considered a contamination of the jury proceedings."
1,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"Beyond that, Mr. Hayden said in his answer, that the belief of a previous drunken-driving arrest was ''not true,'' as far as he knew."
1,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"Mr. Hayden said the hearing should be limited to that issue, and rebuffed as ''irrelevant'' several other claims of impropriety raised by Mr. Heidgen's lawyer, Stephen LaMagna, as causes for setting aside the guilty verdict."
1,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"Mr. LaMagna also claimed that some jurors felt pressured to vote to convict Mr. Heidgen of the most serious charge, that some discussed the case outside the jury room, and that one said she planned to write a book about it."
1,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,The Heidgen case was unusual because the defendant was prosecuted for a fatal drunken-driving crash under laws treating his crime as the functional equivalent of intentional murder.
1,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"Such prosecutions, while not unprecedented, are considered rare and are usually brought only in the most horrific cases."
5,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"Mr. Heidgen, whose blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit, was driving the wrong way on the Meadowbrook Parkway when his pickup truck crashed head-on with a limousine taking a family home from a wedding."

5,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"The girl's parents and grandparents, who were also in the limousine, suffered minor injuries."
5,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"After three days of deliberations, the jury told Acting Justice Alan R. Honorof of State Supreme Court that it was deadlocked, but after he sent them back for more deliberations, reached a verdict on the fifth day."
4,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"Within days of the verdict, though, the jury forewoman said she had felt pressured to vote for the charge of ''murder by depraved indifference'' that Mr. Heidgen was convicted of, even though she believed he was guilty of the lesser crime of manslaughter."
3,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"Based on the depraved indifference conviction, Mr. Heidgen faces a minimum of 25 years in prison."
3,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,Manslaughter carries a minimum of 15 years.
1,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"Mr. Heidgen's lawyer, who could not be reached for comment on Wednesday, has said that based on interviews with other jury members, he believed that some jurors browbeat the last two holdouts who thought Mr. Heidgen was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder."
1,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"''It is fairly rare for hearings like these to be held,'' said George Goltzer, vice president of the New York State Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers."
1,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,''The general rule is that you don't let a jury impeach its own verdict.
1,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,But if the charges are serious -- say that racism or serious misconduct was involved in the decision or something like that -- the courts have allowed it.''
1,Jurors in Drunken-Driver Trial May Be Queried on Verdict,"Mr. Goltzer said he was not too familiar with the case, but added that evidence of ''extra-record information'' -- not part of the evidence introduced at the trial -- might qualify as serious enough to review a jury's verdict."

0,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"Instead, the underperformance results from unprofitable transactions that are forced by the buy-and-sell decisions of shareholders."
2,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,This defense of the average fund manager comes from a new study called ''Does Motivation Matter When Assessing Trade Performance?
2,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,An Analysis of Mutual Funds.''
3,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"The authors of the study, which has been circulating as an academic working paper, are three finance professors: Gordon J. Alexander of the University of Minnesota and Scott Gibson and Gjergji Cici, both at the Mason Business School of the College of William and Mary."
3,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,A version is at papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract-id=641743.
3,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,The professors' research builds on fund managers' motivations to buy or sell a stock.
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"The most obvious, of course, is that they believe that the stock they're buying will climb and that the stock they're selling will fall."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,But only some trades purely reflect such convictions.
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"When investors are pouring money into the fund or selling in droves, managers have to buy or sell stocks that they would not have traded otherwise."
3,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"The study used a new method for segregating fund trades according to these different motivations, allowing the professors to measure managers' pure stock-picking abilities as well as the effects of fund inflows and outflows on fund performance."
3,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"The key to the approach was measuring how much money was being invested in a fund, or withdrawn from it, at the time of each transaction."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"Consider a large purchase that a fund manager made during a period when investors were, on balance, withdrawing a lot of money from the fund."
8,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"The professors assumed that because the manager didn't have to buy the stock in order to invest a large inflow of cash, he must have believed that it would be an above-average performer -- a ''valuation-motivated buy,'' in the professors' parlance."
8,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"Similarly, a ''valuation-motivated sell'' would be a big sale that occurred when there was a large net inflow of cash into a fund."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"The professors built two hypothetical portfolios, one for the valuation-motivated buys and the other for the valuation-motivated sells."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,The portfolios changed composition every quarter.
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"From January 1980 through December 2003, the professors found, the first portfolio performed 2.8 percentage points a year better than the stock market as a whole, on average, while the second trailed the market by an average of 0.7 percentage point a year."
3,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"The study says this means that ''when fund managers make purely valuation-motivated trades, they beat the market by a substantial margin.''"
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,Then there are the trades that are intended primarily to meet redemption requests or to put new cash to work in the market.
8,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"The professors assume that ''liquidity-motivated buys'' are those that occur when there is a large inflow of new cash, while ''liquidity-motivated sells'' occur amid a large number of redemption requests."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,They acknowledge that some of these trades may be motivated by considerations other than liquidity.
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"But, they say, the average trade in their liquidity-motivated categories is less likely than that of the valuation-motivated groups to be a pure reflection of managers' beliefs about a stock's potential."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"The professors built two portfolios of stocks in these liquidity-motivated categories, one for the buys and one for the sells."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"The relative performance of the two liquidity portfolios was nearly opposite that of the valuation-motivated versions, with the buys now lagging the market and the sells outperforming it."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"In fact, the liquidity-motivated sells outperformed the buys by two percentage points a year, on average."
3,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"In other words, the transactions that managers must make to meet liquidity needs eliminate much of the profit from trades made for valuation reasons."
8,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"Transaction costs, which were not included in the calculations, coupled with management fees, eliminate the rest of that profit for the average fund."
3,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,The professors interpret their findings to mean that mutual fund investors pay a high price for the chance to invest or withdraw money at any time.
3,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"And the cost is borne by all investors, whether or not they take advantage of the opportunity."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,The investment implication is clear: don't pay for liquidity unless you need daily access to your money.
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,Are closed-end funds the preferred alternative for long-term investors?
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,It might appear that way.
3,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"After all, the amount of assets under management at closed-end funds doesn't change when investors buy or sell shares, because the number of shares outstanding is fixed."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,This means the managers of closed-end funds are immune from rapid inflows and outflows of cash.
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,But Professor Gibson said in an interview that he did not think closed-end funds were the way to go.
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"Because the funds' assets under management don't change even when performance is awful, the closed-end fund industry ''helps entrench poor-performing managers,'' he said."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"And because these funds won't receive new money even when performance is spectacular, he said, they tend to ''turn away the best managers who want to grow asset-based fees.''"
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"Because of those considerations, Professor Gibson says he instead favors open-end mutual funds that significantly restrict short-term trades."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"Such funds, he says, are more likely than closed-end funds to attract better managers and offer a powerful incentive for them to beat the market."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"And because of the restrictions on short-term trades, long-term investors don't subsidize the liquidity needs of the short-term traders."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"Professor Gibson says he particularly likes funds that charge redemption fees on short-term trades, especially when the fees go back into the fund."
1,It’s Not the Manager. It’s the Liquidity.,"It's easy to see why short-term traders don't like these fees, he said, but ''if you're a long-term investor, they are your best friend.''"

1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"IF 2006 proved anything, it's that aging bull markets don't have to die simply because they're old, or that they must quietly fade away."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Given enough of a dose of economic growth, corporate profits and cheap capital, a bull market that's more than four years old -- as this one is -- can still rage on like a young buck."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,That was certainly what mutual fund investors discovered last year.
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Emboldened by an economy that proved resilient in the face of Federal Reserve interest-rate increases, high oil prices and a cooling housing market, the average general domestic stock fund gained 12.8 percent last year."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Among all stock funds that invest in domestic equities, including single-sector portfolios, the average gain was even better: 13.4 percent, according to Morningstar, the mutual fund tracker."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"To be sure, this was shy of the return of 15.8 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-index of blue-chip stocks, which had its best year since 2003."
5,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"But it was a surprising improvement from 2005, when domestic stock funds gained 7.7 percent, on average, and looked to be tiring."
0,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,Many people on Wall Street say the market's momentum could last well into this year.
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"And in at least one respect, history is on the market's side."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Since 1945, the S.& P. 500 has never declined in the third year of a presidential term, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P. And the average gain for equities during these years has been 18 percent."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"As has been the case throughout this decade, the equity markets caught a much-needed second wind in the fourth quarter, which drove the Dow Jones industrial average and the Russell 2000 index of small stocks to record levels late last year."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"According to Morningstar, the average domestic stock fund surged 6.9 percent in the quarter, marking the sixth consecutive year-end rally for stocks."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,What propelled stock prices higher this time?
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"For starters, data released late in the year ''put to rest all the extraneous worries about the economy,'' said James Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston."
5,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"In the spring, concerns that the Federal Reserve may have done too good of a job of slowing the economy threatened to tame the bull market."
5,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"In fact, a growing number of economists began to worry about the possibility of a recession on the horizon."
5,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"As a result, stocks ran into a proverbial wall of worry in the spring and early summer."
5,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"From May 5 to June 13, the S.& P. 500 slumped 7.7 percent, its worst slide since the bear market earlier this decade."
5,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"For the entire second quarter, the average domestic stock fund lost 2.8 percent."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"But as it turned out, the economy -- and consumers, for that matter -- proved stronger than expected."
5,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Moreover, oil prices stabilized and the Fed all but said that it was done raising short-term interest rates for now."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"''Once investors were no longer worried about recession, they were willing to jump back on the risk train,'' said Thomas W. McDowell, chief executive and chief investment officer at Rice Hall James, an investment management firm in San Diego."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,He's not kidding.
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"In the fourth quarter, investors, whom many analysts thought would embrace relatively conservative assets like blue-chip domestic stocks, went back to their speculative ways."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,AND they were rewarded handsomely for their risk taking.
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Within the fixed-income world, for example, the average emerging-market bond fund rose 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 11.1 percent for the year."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"High-yield bond funds did nearly as well, posting quarterly gains of 4.2 percent and annual returns of 10.3 percent."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"By comparison, the average bond fund that invests in long-term debt issued by the United States government rose just 0.1 percent in the quarter and 0.6 percent for the year."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,The picture was much the same in the equity markets.
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"The average diversified emerging-market stock fund, for example, soared 17.4 percent in the quarter and finished the year up 32.6 percent, according to Morningstar."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"The best-performing fund category was Latin American stock portfolios, which posted gains of 21.5 percent for the quarter and 45.2 percent for 2006."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"On the domestic front, many of the same sectors that have been leading the markets in recent years dominated again in 2006."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Precious-metals funds, for instance, rallied 32.2 percent for the year and are now up 33.7 percent, annualized, over the last five years."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Real estate and utilities portfolios also soared, posting average gains last year of 34 percent and 25.5 percent, respectively."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"And thanks in part to the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions, financial sector funds rose 16.4 percent, on average."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Despite predictions that this would be the year when large-cap domestic stock funds returned to dominance, small-cap stock funds again led the domestic markets among general domestic stock funds."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"According to Morningstar, the average small-cap growth fund advanced 11.1 percent last year, versus 7.3 percent for the average large-cap growth portfolio."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"And while large-cap value funds outperformed their small-cap counterparts for the full year, they trailed small-cap value funds in the fourth quarter."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"''This appetite for risk has me a little worried,'' Mr. Swanson said."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"He asserted that investors aren't simply expecting a so-called soft landing in the economy -- in other words, the avoidance of a recession."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"''The market is bracing for the plane to circle and take off again -- and I think that's too optimistic,'' he said."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Another reason that speculative investments are doing so well is that despite 17 interest-rate increases since June 2004, ample liquidity continues to slosh around the global financial markets."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"''Right now, there's still too much money chasing too few financial assets,'' said Stuart A. Schweitzer, global markets strategist at J. P. Morgan Asset and Wealth Management."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, agreed."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"''This is the only time in postwar history where a recovery has taken place without any rise in long-term borrowing costs,'' he said."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"He noted that yields on 10-year Treasury notes were virtually unchanged from June 2004, when the Fed began its tightening cycle in an effort to slow the economy and tame inflation."
8,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Until this changes, Mr. Paulsen argues that the markets will continue to be led by small-cap stocks that are economically cyclical."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,He is in the minority.
8,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,A vast majority of money managers and market strategists are banking that investors will regain interest in large-cap stocks as attention turns to the slowing economy and corporate profit growth later in the year.
2,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Indeed, a recent survey of money managers by the Russell Investment Group showed that investors were more bullish on large-cap growth and large-cap value stocks than they were on small-cap growth and small-cap value shares."
2,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"And in general, investors are anticipating a fifth consecutive positive year for equities."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,Yet bull markets rarely survive to this age.
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"In fact, of the last 14 bull markets in domestic equities, only four lasted five years or longer."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"And the average bull lived only 3.7 years, according to InvesTech Research."
2,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"According to the Russell survey, 8 in 10 investors believe that domestic stocks will have another positive year in 2007."
2,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"And a third are predicting gains of at least 10 percent, in part because of a slowing-but-still growing economy and a possible rate cut by the Federal Reserve."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,But all of this bullishness has some market watchers nervous.
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"''There's certainly less pessimism today about 2007 that there was a year ago,'' Mr. Paulsen said."
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"While that may be good news for investor confidence, he added, ''it means the risks in the market are higher.''"
1,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"FOR instance, what if corporate profit growth -- estimated at 15.5 percent last year, versus 13.7 percent in 2005 -- slows more than expected?"
5,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"Mr. Schweitzer points out that six months ago, Wall Street analysts were expecting corporate profits among S.& P. 500 companies to jump 10.5 to 10.75 percent in 2007."
3,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"''Now, the latest forecasts are for growth of a little more than 9 percent,'' he said."
8,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"While this is none too shabby, ''the ebbing of corporate profit growth expectations may continue in 2007 and unsettle investors,'' he said."
8,Will This Bull Ever Retire?,"At the very least, Mr. Schweitzer said, the worrisome degree of optimism among investors means that ''the chances of a bumpy ride on Wall Street are quite high.''"
